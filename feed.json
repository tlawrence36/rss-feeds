      "A former friend of A$AP Rocky is set to testify about the moment the hip-hop star allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021",
      "A former friend of A$AP Rocky is set to testify Wednesday about the moment the hip-hop star allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "The trial\u2019s key witness, known by the name A$AP Relli, will provide what\u2019s likely to be the trial\u2019s most important piece of testimony when he gets back on the stand.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, has pleaded not guilty two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. His lawyer says the shots he fired were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop.",
      "On Tuesday, Relli, born Terell Ephron, described the first part of the confrontation, and was on the verge of describing the alleged shooting itself when court ended for the day.",
      "He said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after fame came for Rocky.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and getting worse in the previous days, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel.",
      "\u201cI told him to use it. Because mentally I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Relli testified, with his old friend staring at him intently from the defense table. \u201cI physically could not believe there was a gun in my face. That was the breaking point for me.\u201d",
      "He said he had expected to argue but reconcile with his old friend, and the last thing he wanted to do was get into a fight that could ruin the modest music management business he had built.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s famous,\u201d Relli said. \u201cI\u2019m nobody.\u201d",
      "The testimony will come on an abbreviated court day. The trial will only be in session for two hours in the morning because of a prosecutor's previous commitment. Relli can expect to face fierce cross-examination from the defense that could begin Wednesday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky's rap songs became a phenomenon on the streets of New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",
      "He's set to have his biggest career year as a multi-media star. This Sunday, he's nominated for a Grammy Award for best music video for his song \u201cTailor Swif,\" at the ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles from the Los Angeles courthouse where his trial's being held.",
      "He's also set to headline the Rolling Loud Music Festival, to star opposite Denzel Washington in a film directed by Spike Lee, and to co-chair the Met Gala in May.",
      "But the prospect of a conviction and the possibility of a maximum of 24 years in prison casts a shadow over all of it.",
      "Rocky is the longtime partner of Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She has yet to appear at his trial.",

The fight with his brother would be just weeks before WrestleMania, the biggest event on the pro wrestling calendar.",

      "The runway pieces struck a balance between whimsy and drama. Beyond the house's bread-and-butter tweed skirt suits, leg-of-mutton sleeves brought historical grandeur, evoking a sense of Victorian elegance. Sequins and paillettes shimmered under the bring Grand Palais light. Silk trains in bold red injected a sense of drama. Playful neckties hinted at a 1970s influence.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum, which he said will be renovated and expanded in a major overhaul within the next ten years",
      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has set a March 2026 trial date for actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni to resolve their claims stemming from their work on the movie \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",

      "Taylor Swift is likely headed to her second straight Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You could say that Taylor Swift's championship era is in its second consecutive season.",
      "The 14-time Grammy Award-winning superstar returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday and watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 32-29 for a spot in their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Rose Byrne plays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You.\u201d",
      "Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at the Sundance Film Festival was easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival\u2019s must-sees.",
      "Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter\u2019s mysterious illness. She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "\u201cI'm getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,\u201d said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros' work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge cult following,\u201d said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros' characters. \u201cThe drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, \u201cYes, Queen!\" The \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series has made Yarros one of the country's most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy.",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling \u201cIron Flame\u201d came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, \"Onyx Storm\" has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain.",
      "Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (\"He's 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest\"), swore casually and joked that hers was the \u201conly profession where you can have imaginary fiends\u201d and not be considered insane.",
      "She expressed relief and pleasure over completing \u201cOnyx Storm,\" noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done.",
      "\u201cAs much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d isn't quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon \u2014 the final Potter book by J.K. Rowling, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours \u2014 but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity.",
      "Like the Potter books, the release of \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry.",
      "\"This is a book I personally want to take my time with,\" said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather.",
      "\"I want to savor this moment,\" Bao-angan said.",
      "Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors as Sarah J. Maas have been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing's most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media \u2014 some crying, some cursing in amazement \u2014 have been posting their responses to \u201cOnyx Storm.\"",
      "On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label.",
      "Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn't only a writer or public figure.",
      "\u201cI can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I've learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband's together,\u201d she said. \u201cReal life is not what happens on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you guys,\u201d she added. \u201cBut peace out.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe want to be sensitive to the moment and we want to be sensitive to what\u2019s happened,\" O'Brien said Friday. \"It is top of our minds and we are talking about it a lot.\"",
      "\u201cThe Oscars is still I think it\u2019s five weeks away. And we want to make sure that we process all of that and that we put on the best show for March 2. Not the best show that we thought of tonight. Not the best show for March 3, the best show for March 2 that reflects what people are feeling in that moment.\u201d",
      "O'Brien, the former \u201cTonight Show\u201d host, spoke at the premiere of his latest film, \u201cIf I had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d which also stars Rose Byrne."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival welcomed back three Oscar-winning documentary filmmakers to help kick off the annual independent film showcase in Park City, Utah.",
      "On Thursday night at The Ray Theater, \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, who won the Oscar last year, debuted his latest dispatch from Ukraine, \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a harrowing journey to the front lines of a 2023 counteroffensive. A few hours later, at the Eccles, Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar for \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d in 2022, unveiled his Sly Stone portrait, \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genuis).\u201d Earlier, \u201cOne Day in September\u201d filmmaker Kevin MacDonald also showcased his film \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d which debuted last year at the Venice Film Festival and will get an IMAX release on April 11 before hitting Max later this year.",
      "Some critics reflected that \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, was even more powerful than \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d \u201cSLY LIVES!\u201d (on Hulu Feb. 13) was called \u201csublime\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d in its examination of an underappreciated, shapeshifting genius.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since 2000 and I thought the coolest thing you could do would be to DJ an after party,\u201d Thompson said before the screening. \u201cI never dreamt this for my future, so this is really humbling.\u201d",
      "It was a full-circle end to a day that began with a slate of documentary Oscar nominations all connected to the Sundance Institute in some way. Some were supported by the Institute, some debuted at the festival as recently as last year.",
      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "Junya Watanabe has opened his latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week with beige hunting jackets paired with discreet shirts and ties",
      "PARIS -- Beige hunting jackets with oversized pockets, paired with discreet shirts and ties, opened Junya Watanabe\u2019s latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week Friday.",
      "It was a deceptively classic start for the avant-garde Japanese designer, whose signature knack for subversive tailoring and patchwork soon disrupted conventions.",
      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

      "Opening statements are beginning at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of firing a handgun at a former friend",
      "A$AP Rocky is the celebrity in the room, but A$AP Relli will star at his trial.",
      "The hip-hop star, fashion maven and actor, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at his former friend Relli, born Terell Ephron, on whose testimony prosecutors are pinning their case.",
      "Opening statements are set to begin Friday at the trial after a jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "He took a major risk by turning down a prosecution plea deal offer of just six months in jail and instead choosing to go to trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a term of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The defense plans to paint Ephron as a money seeker and point out he has sued Rocky in civil court, seeking financial damages for the incident.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the witness that this case will rise and fall on, for sure,\u201d Rocky\u2019s lead attorney Joe Tacopina said after a recent pretrial hearing. \u201cWhether he\u2019s a star is something that remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s jealousy obviously, and he\u2019s made that clear. He became a hater,\u201d Tacopina said. \u201cThis is in large part about money, money, money.\u201d",
      "Rocky and Relli were part of a group of young creators in high school in New York who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for Always Strive and Prosper \u2014 and initially remained close as Rocky found wealth and fame through music. The relationship soured, coming to a head with the alleged shooting on Nov. 6, 2021, when Ephron says Rocky fired on him and grazed his knuckles.",
      "The defense plans to call witnesses to testify that a firearm seen on a security video is a starter pistol that Rocky carried as a prop for security.",
      "They likely will say that is why, despite a search of the spot by many police officers, no shell casings were found at the site near Hollywood and Vine. Police did not recover a gun in the case.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later and brought 9 mm shell casings he had picked up himself, which are both points the defense will seize on. No fingerprints were recovered from the casings.",
      "The trial\u2019s celebrity goes beyond Rocky. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star\u2019s longtime partner is Rihanna and the couple have two toddler sons together.",
      "Tacopina suggested it\u2019s unlikely Rihanna will show up in court and her name may not come up at all, though it did frequently during jury selection when many prospective jurors said they were fans.",
      "Rocky has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May and has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after. But his life could be upended with a conviction.",
      "In the deal from prosecutors he rejected, Rocky was to plead guilty to one of the two counts in exchange for a sentence recommendation of 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended prison sentence and three years of probation.",
      "Beyond Ephron, the prosecution's witnesses primarily will be the police who worked on the case.",
      "They also will rely heavily on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident and the circumstances. Prosecutors at the 2023 preliminary hearing showed a still image taken from video with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Rocky himself could take the stand and his attorney has said he wants to, but the lawyers say they have not yet decided and he is legally allowed to avoid testifying."

      "Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d The film kicked off the 41st Sundance Film Festival Thursday, as the first major premiere in the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah.",
      "After the screening audiences in the theater, some wiping tears away, greeted Matlin with a standing ovation when she took the stage.",
      "The film delves into all aspects of her life, personal and professional: Her childhood and how her family handled learning she had become deaf at 18 months; her experience winning the best actress Oscar for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and her allegedly abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "The film was directed by Shoshanna Stern, who also is deaf. Matlin specifically requested that Stern take on the project when American Masters approached her about doing a documentary.",
      "Matlin has written about her experiences before, including her volatile relationship with Hurt and drugs, in a memoir, \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later.\u201d But before the #MeToo movement, she felt her allegations were largely dismissed or glossed over.",
      "Interviews from the book's press tour show journalists were more interested in the \u201camazing sex\u201d she said she had with Hurt than the stories of the alleged physical and verbal abuse. One interviewer asked her why she waited \u201cso long\u201d to come forward with the claims.",
      "The documentary isn\u2019t just a portrait of Matlin, but a broader look at deaf culture and how Matlin was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as a de facto spokesperson for all deaf causes.",
      "In addition to being the first, and until Troy Kotsur won for \u201cCODA\u201d in 2022, only deaf actor to win an Academy Award, she helped lobby Congress for closed captioning and delved into the Gallaudet University protest about hiring hearing people to preside over the university, which is the subject of another Sundance documentary, \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d",
      "Matlin also faced backlash when she spoke while presenting the best actor Oscar the year after she won, an experience that she said made her distance herself from deaf causes.",
      "It features moving interviews from her longtime translator and other important figures in her life such as Henry Winkler, who met her when she was a student at age 12.",
      "Winkler watched her perform a song during a school production after she wrote him a fan letter. Later, she stayed in his home for two years after her breakup with Hurt and had her wedding there. In the film, Matlin said she never would have pursued acting if it weren\u2019t for Winkler, although he disagreed.",
      "The film is closed captioned and includes verbal translations for hearing audiences. In a unique approach, the subjects were interviewed by Stern with an earpiece, allowing them to hear translations from another room.",
      "Matlin said she has struggled occasionally to convince the industry to let her play roles that aren\u2019t necessarily written for a deaf actor. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote a part for her in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d dispelled the notion it is difficult to write for deaf actors.",
      "When \u201cCODA\u201d came around, the studio wanted to cast an A-list, hearing male star opposite Matlin. She threatened to walk if it weren\u2019t a deaf actor and was gratified when Kotsur won the Oscar, hence the \u201cnot alone anymore\u201d subtitle. Her big disappointment was not being able to say a few words on stage during the event.",
      "Asked why this moment was the right time for a documentary, Matlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s never really the right time. So, why not?\u201d",

      "The couple, who rose to stardom on \u201cThe Hills,\" a spin-off of \u201cLaguna Beach,\u201d filed the lawsuit Tuesday along with more than 20 other property owners and residents who were affected by the Palisades Fire. The complaint blames Los Angeles and its municipal water department for the water issues that hampered firefighting efforts and says it ultimately led to the damage to their properties.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires, ignited by strong winds during one of the region's driest years on record, have killed 28 people and destroyed more than 12,000 structures, putting them among the most destructive fires in California history.",
      "There has been intense scrutiny over hydrants running dry and problems with water pressure, leading to a barrage of lawsuits against the city and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the LA water utility over the issues.",
      "The complaint filed by the couple and others mentions that the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which services the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, was offline and had been out of commission since February 2024 while awaiting repairs. The hydrants in the neighborhood were connected to three tanks that held 1 million gallons (3.7 million liters) of water each and went dry within 12 hours, the complaint said, citing Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, the water utility's chief executive and chief engineer.",
      "Without water from the reservoir, firefighters had to primarily rely on the water tanks, which were not designed to fight such a large fire, the complaint said.",
      "The city and water utility did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "While the repairs to the reservoir were requested in January 2024, the water utility told the Los Angeles Times they would not be completed until April or May 2025.",
      "The lawsuit called the Palisades Fire an \u201cinescapable and unavoidable consequence\u201d of the water system operated by the city and water utility.",
      "\u201cThe system necessarily failed, and this failure was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiffs to suffer the losses alleged in this complaint,\u201d it said.",
      "The plaintiffs cite the principle known as \u201c inverse condemnation,\u201d which is the same mechanism that requires utilities to pay for wildfire damages caused by their equipment."

      "The film academy had plenty of surprise nominations Thursday for the 97th Oscars",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- In one of the more wide-open Oscar fields in recent history, there were plenty of nominations surprises Thursday.",
      "Not too long ago, it seemed that people like Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman were destined for best actress nominations, while general audience disinterest in the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d might have indicated its awards chances were dead on arrival.",
      "But the members of the film academy had something different in mind. Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the 97th Oscar nominations.",
      "The young Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d has been one of the bigger awards season question marks, especially after it failed to resonate with moviegoers in theaters. And yet both Jeremy Strong, for his portrayal for Trump lawyer Roy Cohn, and Sebastian Stan (who was also in the conversation for \u201cA Different Man\u201d ), for playing the future two-time president, made it in. Only Strong got nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.",
      "This will forever be one of the more confounding awards season oversights. Marianne Jean-Baptiste delivered one of the all-time great performances in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths,\u201d as the perpetually aggrieved and sharp-tongued London woman Pansy. The general thinking is that it was either going to be Jean-Baptiste or Fernanda Torres, and Torres got in for the equally beloved \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "This is perhaps up for debate, but there was certainly a lot of goodwill behind Anderson\u2019s movie-star turn in Gia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d especially considering her SAG nomination. But like with Jennifer Lopez and \u201cHustlers\u201d a few years ago, it was not meant to be at the Oscars.",
      "James Mangold has directed several awards darlings, including \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d and \u201cWalk the Line\u201d but had consistently missed out on a best director nomination, until this year with \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d It may have come at the expense of Edward Berger, who missed out on a nod for \u201cConclave\u201d or Denis Villeneuve for \u201cDune: Part Two.\u201d",
      "Daniel Craig gave one of his best performances as an American expat in Mexico in the torrid May-December romance in \u201cQueer,\u201d but it hasn\u2019t been resonating with awards voters. The Oscar snub is the final piece in a puzzle that just never came together.",
      "If there ever were a shoo-in for a nomination and an Oscar, on paper at least, it would be for Angelina Jolie playing opera legend Maria Callas. Filmmaker Pablo Larra\u00edn had not missed yet in getting best actress nominations for his famous, tragic women biopics, including Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie\u201d and Kristen Stewart for \u201cSpencer.\u201d But somehow Jolie did not make the cut in the end.",
      "\u201cBabygirl\u201d is not a cliche awards movie by a long stretch, but Nicole Kidman\u2019s performance as Romy, the buttoned-up, married CEO who begins a dangerous affair with a young intern at her company was undeniable. But a best actress win at the Venice Film Festival has never guaranteed Oscar success.",
      "Despite the wide love for \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Felicity Jones has been curiously absent from many nominations lists for her sharp portrayal of Erzs\u00e9bet T\u00f3th. The cast did not even get recognized by SAG. But it just goes to show that it\u2019s never too late to sneak in for the big one",
      "A few years after Danielle Deadwyler was famously snubbed for \u201cTill,\u201d she has another snub to add to her resume for Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d This latest campaign might not have had as much steam behind it as \u201cTill,\u201d but at the very least one would assume that it could have been a make good.",
      "Supporting actress was one of the more chaotic and unpredictable categories this year, with so many deserving performers in the mix. Monica Barbaro was one of those that was on the fringe of possibilities for her turn as Joan Baez, singing and all, for \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "One who was not so lucky was Selena Gomez for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d perhaps because she was partially competing with her co-star, Zo\u00eb Salda\u00f1a who simply had more momentum (and gave a moving speech at the Golden Globes).",
      "The incarceration drama \u201cSing Sing\u201d did get several significant nominations including for Colman Domingo, adapted screenplay and original song. But Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin, who delivered a revelatory performance based on his own experience, was not among them. He is, however, credited with helping to write the story.",
      "Margaret Qualley seems to have been unfairly left out of much of the awards conversation around \u201cThe Substance,\u201d a movie that only works with a great Sue. But the focus has been more on Demi Moore, overdue for such recognition, and Coralie Fargeat \u2014 the only woman to score a best director nomination.",
      "Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross delivered one of their most popular scores ever this year for \u201cChallengers\u201d and yet were left off in a batch of nominees that included \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d It\u2019s not even that they\u2019re consistently overlooked by the academy \u2014 they\u2019ve already won twice, for \u201cSoul\u201d and \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d",
      "Everyone expected the Latvian cat movie \u201cFlow\u201d to get a best animated feature nomination, especially after it won the Golden Globe. But the big surprise is that it got a second for best international feature \u2014 a first for Latvia. This is not a first for an animated movie to get into the international category, though: \u201cWaltz with Bashir\u201d and \u201cFlee\u201d had the honor before \u201cFlow,\u201d but neither ended up winning.",
      "RaMell Ross\u2019 \u201cNickel Boys\u201d has had quite the rollercoaster awards season journey, even though it\u2019s widely considered one of the best films of the year. The film academy thought so too, including it among the 10 best picture nominees (alongside other relative surprises like \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d and \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d). Oddly, though, it missed out on cinematography despite its inventive first-person point of view."

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 08:58:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "President Trump\u2019s first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth\u2019s climate and environment",
      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",

      "A new study suggests that a pill used for emergency contraception could be repurposed at a higher dose as an abortion drug, providing a possible alternative to mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in the most common type of abortion in the United States.",
      "Mifepristone has been under attack by abortion opponents, with several states seeking in federal court to restrict its use.",
      "Now used in two-thirds of U.S. abortions, mifepristone blocks a hormone needed to sustain a pregnancy. It's typically used with misoprostol, which causes contractions and bleeding.",
      "In the study, 133 women who were up to nine weeks' pregnant took a 60 milligram dose of ulipristal acetate, the active ingredient in the prescription contraceptive Ella, followed by misoprostol 24 hours later.",
      "For 97% of them, that drug combo was effective at inducing an abortion, an effectiveness equal to the mifepristone-misoprostol combination. Four women needed a procedure or an additional medication to complete the abortion.",
      "The 60 milligram dose of ulipristal used in the study is twice the dose of Ella, a prescription drug used for emergency contraception.",
      "The company that makes Ella says on its website that it won't end an existing pregnancy. It can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy.",
      "The findings, published Thursday in the journal NEJM Evidence, may make emergency contraception a target of abortion opponents.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really worried that these results could be misapplied by anti-abortion activists to try to further their assault on contraception,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.

    "summary": "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
    "story": [
      "Digital screens are pervasive at work and in homes and schools stores",
      "NEW YORK -- The trouble started every day at around 3 p.m., after Cathy Higgins had spent five or six hours staring at an array of computer screens at her desk. Her university job overseeing research projects involved peering closely at numbers and details on contracts, applications and budgets.",
      "\u201cMy vision was so blurry, I couldn\u2019t even see what was on the screen, and I was squinting so much that I could not function,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "When her eyesight got bad, Higgins walked around and spoke with members of her staff. She began planning in-person meetings for afternoons. But she would resume the computer work late at night after her children went to bed.",
      "\u201cIf I had to continue working through the blurry vision, that\u2019s when the migraines would happen,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Digital screens are pervasive, not only at work but in our homes, schools and shops. An estimated 104 million Americans of working age spend more than seven hours a day in front of screens, according to the American Optometric Association. All that screen time can take a toll.",
      "Too much exposure to screens can lead to dry or watery eyes, fuzzy vision and headaches. It can also lead to myopia, or nearsightedness, in some people, especially children. Some technology workers even describe short bouts of vertigo when they look at screens for too long.",
      "One reason for the discomfort is that staring closely at screens for prolonged periods causes the muscle that helps eye focus to tighten up.",
      "\u201cThat muscle's not supposed to stay tight all day long. And if it does, it's like picking up a light weight and trying to hold it over your head for hours,\u201d American Optometric Association President Steven Reed said. \u201cIt\u2019s not hard to pick it up. But after a while, even though it\u2019s not a heavy lift, your body just gets tired.\u201d",
      "Fortunately, exposure to blue light from computer screens and devices has not been shown to cause permanent eye damage, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Nevertheless, symptoms can disrupt work, family time and rest. As an optometrist in Mississippi, Reed sees patients who complain of frequent eye pain, headaches and blurry vision associated with computer use. He advises getting an eye exam and taking frequent breaks.",
      "For Higgins, trying to catch up on the work she couldn't do when her eyes were too fatigued on weekdays cut into time she spent with her daughters on weekends. \u201cThey\u2019d be playing together, and I couldn\u2019t be as engaged as I would have liked to have been in what they were doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Here are some tips from eye health professionals to reduce eye strain caused by devices.",
      "Take a break every 20 minutes from sitting at a computer. During the break, focus your eyes on something that's about 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Pausing close-up work and looking at something in the distance gives tired, tight muscles time to relax.",
      "\u201cLuckily, eye strain is temporary,\u201d said Raj Maturi, an ophthalmologist at Midwest Eye Institute in Indianapolis who serves as spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. \u201cThe best way to avoid these symptoms is by taking breaks from our screens or near work activities and using lubricating eye drops, if needed.\u201d",
      "People usually blink about 18 to 22 times per minute. But when looking at a screen, the rate drops to three to seven times per minute, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's where eye drops come in.",
      "It's good to move around and go outside, but when you don't have time for an outdoor walk, frequent 20-second breaks can help.",
      "Some people find that using a larger computer monitor helps reduce eye fatigue. You can also increase the font size on your laptop, monitor or smartphone screen.",
      "Higgins did all of the above after she started a new job as senior vice president at Stand Up to Cancer. Since she works remotely from home in Midlothian, Virginia, she got a 29-inch monitor and sits about three feet away from it, about a foot farther than in most office setups.",
      "The changes helped. She still has occasional issues with blurriness, but not as frequently. \u201cWhen I have an extended day, like a 12-hour day, that\u2019s when I start to have vision issues again,\u201d she said.",
      "Sitting an arm\u2019s length away from your screen and adjusting it so you\u2019re looking slightly downward also can help reduce eye strain, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology.",
      "Some products, such as blue light glasses, are marketed with claims that they will reduce digital eye strain, improve sleep and prevent eye disease. But several studies have found the glasses are not very effective, according to the American Academy of Opthalmology. It's really our behavior with digital devices that causes symptoms, not the small amount of blue light coming from screens, the group said.",
      "After stepping away from computers at work, many people find themselves reading or scrolling on smartphone screens. It's not just workers: children are using laptops, tablets and smart screens in school settings throughout the day.",
      "Too much screen time or focusing on nearby objects can accelerate the onset and progression of nearsightedness, especially in children, said Ayesha Malik, pediatric optometrist in the division of ophthalmology at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Anyone streaming shows should do so on a television, instead of a tablet, to help relieve eye strain, she said.",
      "Children should follow the 20-20-20-2 rule, which includes an extra \u201c2\u201d at the end to encourage playing outdoors for 2 hours a day, which helps with eye development, she said.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that most children are engaging with screens throughout the day at school and home. It becomes difficult to track the total number of hours,\u201d Malik said. \u201cAim for not more than 20 minutes during any one session.\u201d",
      "The blue light that digital screens emit can increase alertness, so watching Netflix on an iPad or scrolling through social media feeds in bed may make it hard to get restful sleep.",
      "To give your eyes and brain the rest they need, doctors recommend turning off screens one to two hours before going to sleep. You can also set devices to \u201cdark mode\u201d in the evening to reduce the impact of bright light. If you\u2019re used to streaming videos at night, try listening to an audiobook or podcast instead.",

      "BERLIN -- Chancellor Olaf Scholz's main challenger in Germany's upcoming election plans to put proposals for a tougher migration policy to parliament on Wednesday, a maneuver aimed at piling pressure on the governing parties that has brought accusations that he's breaking commitments to shun the far right.",

      "Germans will vote for a new parliament on Feb. 23 after Scholz's three-party governing coalition collapsed. Polls show Merz's mainstream center-right Union bloc in the lead with around 30% support, the far-right Alternative for Germany second with about 20%, and Scholz's center-left Social Democrats and the environmentalist Greens further back.",

Merz's aim appears to be to make the Union look decisive in seeking a tougher approach, which also has been a central call of Alternative for Germany, or AfD, while making Scholz and the Greens look weak.

      "The United Nations says Rwanda-backed rebels captured large parts of eastern Congo\u2019s largest city of Goma including its airport",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Rwanda-backed rebels captured large parts of Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo, including its airport, the United Nations said, as Rwanda's president on Wednesday joined calls for a ceasefire in the decadeslong conflict amid mounting international pressure.",
      "Much of Goma was calm after a day during which thousands of fleeing people hunkered down by roadsides as missiles flew overhead, and injured people streamed to overwhelmed hospitals.",
      "While government forces still control pockets of Goma, residents who spoke to The Associated Press by phone on Tuesday said that the M23 rebel group was in control of much of the city.",
      "The M23 rebels, who said that they captured the city on Monday after a weekslong advance, are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo. The conflict escalated with the rebels' advance into Goma, which left bodies on the streets and drove hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to flee once again.",
      "After clashing with government forces, the rebels took control of the airport, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said at a briefing on Tuesday, warning of \u201crisks of a breakdown of law and order in the city given the proliferation of weapons.\u201d",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame said on X that he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \u201cthe need to ensure a ceasefire and address the root causes of the conflict once and for all.\u201d",
      "His government denies supporting M23, despite reports from U.N. experts who estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting Hutu rebels and former militiamen whom it blames for the 1994 genocide.",
      "The East African Community, whose members include both Rwanda and Congo, are scheduled to discuss the conflict at a meeting on Wednesday. Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi won't be able to participate in the virtual summit, a spokesperson said, without providing further details.",
      "Pope Francis called for the cessation of hostilities and the protection of civilians.",
      "\u201cWe hope that all forms of violence against people and their property will cease as soon as possible (and) I invite local authorities and the international community to make every effort to resolve the conflict by peaceful means,\u201d Francis said at his weekly general audience.",
      "M23, made up primarily of ethnic Tutsis, has told the AP that it plans to set up an administration in the city so people can continue living normal lives and displaced people can return home.",
      "Analysts have warned that securing a rebel withdrawal could be more difficult than in 2012, when M23 first captured Goma but withdrew after days. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, said that the group has become more emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and which has accused Congo of failing to meet demands of previous peace agreements."

      "Commercial fishing fleets have been playing a key role in the trafficking of parts of tigers poached in Malaysia, according to new research, information that could help enforcement efforts to save the critically endangered cat",
      "BANGKOK -- Commercial fishing fleets have been playing a key role in trafficking parts of tigers poached in Malaysia, according to research released Wednesday that could help enforcement efforts to save the critically endangered cat.",
      "The fishing boats are part of a network of routes used by sophisticated teams of poachers to move parts of illegally killed Malayan Tigers and other poached animals to Vietnam, according to the study by conservation organizations Panthera and ZSL in conjunction with Malaysia's Sunway University.",
      "Through interviews with more than four dozen people involved in the operations, including poachers and those who brokered sales of the illicit goods, researchers found that fishing boats were able to carry larger consignments, cheaper, and less likely to be checked by customs than land or air routes.",
      "\u201cTo really crack a problem and insert the right intervention that's going to have any impact you have to understand the thing inside out,\u201d said Panthara's Rob Pickles, the lead author of the study, in a phone interview from Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThat's what we hope that this study does \u2014 contribute to that depth of understanding of the problem to allow us to tailor the interventions.\u201d",
      "From a population estimated at some 3,000 tigers in the middle of the 20th century, the latest estimates are that there are only about 150 of the cats left in Malaysia and they have already gone extinct in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam over the last 25 years.",
      "In addition to poaching, tigers have lost much of their habitat to deforestation, and they have been falling victim in recent years to the canine distemper virus while a major source of food, the wild boar, has been decimated by the African swine fever virus.",
      "\u201cIt's their last gasp,\u201d Pickles said. \u201cThis is the last chance to turn things around.\u201d",
      "The tigers live in the forests of peninsular Malaysia, which is connected by land to Thailand to the north. They have also been targeted by poachers from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, but researchers said the Vietnamese teams operate on a \u201cdifferent order of magnitude.\u201d",
      "Almost all from the poor, rural and rugged province of Quang Binh, where many took to the jungles to escape relentless American bombing during the Vietnam War, the poachers use well-honed bushcraft skills to live as small teams in the forests for three to five months at a time on poaching excursions.",
      "They capture wild tigers with heavy steel snares made of wires as thick as a person's index finger, as well as other animals.",
      "Once caught, the tigers are killed and processed largely for their bones, which are boiled for days until they become a gelatinous glue-like substance that is pressed into small blocks and sold for perceived medicinal benefits. Claws and teeth are used to make amulets.",
      "As Malaysia went on lockdown during the COVID pandemic, poaching operations came to a near standstill. The researchers were able to use the time to find and interview more than 50 individuals involved in the operations for the study, which was done in two phases concluding in 2024.",
      "Researchers learned that fishing boats were also used to carry bear paws and bile, live civets, wild boar tusks and meat, pangolins, monitor lizards and turtles.",
      "One person told researchers the fishing boats were ideal to send larger items like tiger skins.",
      "\u201cNobody checks,\u201d the interviewee was quoted as saying. \u201cIn addition, people can go back by boat so many things also can be brought back by this route.\u201d",
      "Malaysia and Vietnam have both been increasing maritime controls recently, making trafficking by fishing boats riskier.",
      "Malaysian authorities have also had success in catching poachers and have substantially increased punishments for wildlife crime in recent years, though the study also found that the managers who send the teams into the forests are rarely caught and can easily recruit replacements.",
      "Researchers also learned that many Vietnamese poachers take on significant debt to travel to Malaysia.",
      "They recommend that in addition to focusing more on fishing boats, authorities should target potential poachers in their home villages in Quang Binh with information about the increasing risks and diminishing returns to try and dissuade them from coming to Malaysia in the first place.",
      "Officials in Malaysia and Vietnam, both of which were celebrating public holidays this week, did not respond to requests for comment on the survey and its recommendations.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of a problem or over-rely on the criminal justice system,\u201d said ZSL's Gopalasamy Reuben Clements, a co-author of the report.",
      "\u201cWe need to explore other approaches, such as highly targeted behavioral change interventions, that can run in parallel to arrests and prosecutions.\u201d"

      "For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity",
      "RAMAT GAN, Israel -- For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity. He didn't know if she would hear him, but he ended every interview he gave with the same hopeful message: Romi is coming home alive.",
      "When he finally got to speak to his daughter for the first time in 15 months after she and two other women were freed Jan. 19, he got his answer.",
      "\"She said, \u2019Dad, I came home alive,'\u201d Eitan Gonen told The Associated Press on Tuesday in his first interview with an international news outlet since her release.",
      "\u201cI know that my interview back then gave Romi a lot of strength, a lot of hope, something to cling on,\u201d he said.",
      "Romi Gonen, 24, was among the first hostages to be freed from Gaza and one of seven women so far released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire, a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. About 90 hostages remain in Gaza, although at least a third of them are believed to be dead.",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas agreed to gradually release 33 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Six more hostages are expected to be released this week in exchange for hundreds of prisoners.",
      "Israel has been preparing for the hostages to return, with the expectation that after more than a year in captivity, many would likely be dealing with life-threatening health issues or other physical and psychological problems. This week, Dr. Ami Benov, who is working with the hostages, told reporters that the women were in poor physical condition and would face a lengthy recovery process, as they suffered from \u201cmild starvation\u201d and vitamin deficiencies.",
      "Sitting in a complex in central Israel where his daughter and some of the other freed hostages are staying, Eitan Gonen wouldn't comment on Romi's health but said there's a long road ahead.",
      "\u201cThe rehabilitation status just started,\u201d he said. Because she spent so long in captivity, the family isn't pressuring her to speak. Instead, they are trying to give her autonomy and control, and to let her take things at her own pace, he said.",
      "Like many others, Romi was taken captive at the Nova music festival. That morning, her sister and mother, Merav Leshem Gonen, spent nearly five hours speaking to Romi as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Romi told her family that she would try to hide in the bushes, as the roads being clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible.",
      "For nearly two months, her family had no idea if she was dead. They only learned she was alive from other hostages who were freed during a weeklong ceasefire a month after the attack, Eitan Gonen said.",
      "Praising his daughter's strength, he said she survived in part by learning Arabic, as it was the only way to communicate with her captors.",
      "\u201cHuman beings will do anything to survive. Anything. And since the terrorists don\u2019t speak any other language other than Arabic, she didn\u2019t have any chance in order to communicate with them \u2014 to start learning their language,\u201d he said, noting that she has even spoken it at times since being freed, likely out of habit.",
      "Something else that helped her stay alive was the support from other hostages, Eitan Gonen said. For a period, Romi was held with Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released along with her. \u201cI believe God set it up somehow that Emily and Romi ... had each other to survive. ... It\u2019s a dynamic duo,\u201d he said.",
      "Other released hostages expressed similar sentiments about their own time in captivity. Israeli soldier Naama Levy, who was released Saturday, wrote in an Instagram post that after spending 50 days mostly alone, she was given strength when she was reunited with other kidnapped soldiers.",
      "Being held hostage with someone can provide strength through a shared fight for survival in the face of unimaginable adversity, said Dr. Einat Yehene, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and loss and who is head of rehabilitation at the Hostages Families Forum.",
      "Even though he finally got his daughter back, Eitan Gonen is still urging the Israeli government to keep working to bring home all of the remaining hostages. And he urges the families of hostages to keep giving interviews in all languages and mediums, to maintain the pressure and let their relatives know they haven't been forgotten.",
      "But he's mostly focusing on spending time with his daughter.",
      "\u201cI just enjoy being with her even in silence, touching, hugging, watching her,\u201d he said. \u201cI missed it so much.\"",

      "GUATEMALA CITY -- Margarita Raymundo walked down the ramp of the U.S. Air Force cargo jet and onto the tarmac of Guatemala City\u2019s airport, barely three days after a U.S. Border Patrol agent had apprehended her, along with three other migrants.",
      "The swift deportation Monday was disorienting for her and the 63 other migrants aboard and only possible because the Trump administration has enlisted the military to quickly scale up its deportation capacity, which usually relies on chartered flights.",

Instead, two Colombian air force planes were sent to the U.S. to pick up the Colombians and bring them home Tuesday, but only after a Trump tariff threat and a furious bout of diplomacy.",

      "\u201cWe cannot refuse them and it is our obligation (to receive the migrants),\u201d said Danilo Rivera, the director of Guatemala\u2019s Immigration Institute.",
      "Jorge Santos of the Human Rights Convergence, a Guatemalan coalition, said the deportations should be handled exclusively by civilians, without the use of military planes. He also criticized the practice of shackling deportees, although that occurs on civilian charter flights run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe use of shackles must not be a condition of this situation, nor chaining their feet and hands and much less that a military authority have a role in the framework of an action that must be completely civilian,\u201d Santos said.",
      "Lesly Ram\u00edrez, who was on the same flight as Raymundo, said that her handcuffs were tight and hurt her hands. While the migrants were provided food on the plane, she said it was difficult to eat with their cuffed hands chained to their waists. Authorities on the plane removed them only shortly before landing, she said.",
      "Ram\u00edrez, 35, a single mother of two, had climbed the border fence and had been walking in the U.S. for two hours before the Border Patrol picked her up on Friday.",

She said she now has no hope of ever repaying the debt in Guatemala.",
      "With a restaurant job already secured in the U.S., Raymundo remained determined. \u201cI only have another opportunity to go, I\u2019m going to try,\u201d she said through tears, in reference to smugglers\u2019 common practice of offering multiple tries.",

The stampede was triggered after several Hindu pilgrims inside the temple fell on a slippery floor and were crushed to death by other pilgrims who apparently walked on them.

      "The US Embassy declined to comment and the US\u2019 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency didn\u2019t respond to an email request for comment.",
      "It was unclear whether the 88 Brazilian deportees were taken into custody during the tenure of Donald Trump or former President Joe Biden.",
      "There have been almost four dozen deportation flights from the U.S. to Brazil over the past three years. Brazil has no desire to interrupt them and held talks with the American charge d\u2019affaires on Monday, according to a government source with knowledge of the matter. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Brazil has permitted the use of handcuffs in exceptional circumstances, but not indiscriminately and there must be an evaluation of risk, the person said.",
      "Authorities are looking into how many were handcuffed. There have been passenger reports that the plane\u2019s air conditioning suffered problems, causing intense heat in the cabin, and they exited through the emergency door upon landing in Manaus.",
      "Commenting on the humanitarian center, Evaristo said the objective was to \u201censure that these passengers have good conditions for water, food and even temperature, which I think was the most damaging aspect\u201d in the first flight.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to provoke the American government, but it\u2019s essential that deported Brazilians are treated with dignity,\u201d Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said on Monday."

      "PRAYAGRAJ, India -- Several people were feared dead and many more injured in a stampede early Wednesday as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to take ritual baths in sacred rivers at the massive Maha Kumbh festival in northern India.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident \u201cextremely sad\u201d and extended his condolences without specifying how many had died. \u201cMy deepest condolences to the devotees who have lost their loved ones. Along with this, I wish for the speedy recovery of all the injured,\u201d Modi said in a post on social platform X.",
      "Several pilgrims were injured, some seriously, in the stampede between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. as they tried to jump barricades erected for the movement of religious saints, Uttar Pradesh state\u2019s top elected official, Yogi Adityanath, said in a televised statement.",
      "He made no mention of any deaths even eight hours after the crush of pilgrims at the site. Some local news websites said 10 people had died.",
      "Distressed families lined up outside a makeshift hospital inquiring about their missing relatives, rescuers were helping the injured and police tried to manage the crowds. People\u2019s belongings like clothes, blankets and backpacks were strewn around the scene of the stampede. It was not immediately clear what triggered the panic.",
      "\u201cThe situation is now under control, but there is a massive crowd of pilgrims,\u201d Adityanath said, adding that 90 million to 100 million pilgrims had congregated there.",
      "\u201cAbout 30 million people had taken the holy bath by 8 a.m. Wednesday,\u201d he said.",
      "Wednesday was a sacred day during the six-week festival, and authorities were expecting a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that a dip at the confluence will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation. The main draw are thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who make massive processions toward the confluence to bathe.",
      "Millions continued to throng the site even as police officials urged them over megaphones to avoid the confluence. Adityanath urged people to instead take baths at other riverbanks.",
      "The Maha Kumbh festival, held every 12 years, started on Jan. 13 and is the world\u2019s largest religious gathering. Authorities expect more than 400 million people to throng the pilgrimage site in total.",
      "Nearly 150 million people have already attended, including the likes of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah and celebrities like Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin.",
      "A sprawling tent city was built on the riverbanks to accommodate visitors. It has roads, electricity and water, 3,000 kitchens and 11 hospitals.",
      "About 50,000 security personnel are stationed in the city to maintain law and order and manage crowds, and more than 2,500 cameras monitor crowd movement and density so officials can try to prevent such crushes.",
      "Deadly stampedes are relatively common around Indian religious festivals, where large crowds gather in small areas. In 2013, at least 40 pilgrims who were taking part in the same festival were killed in a stampede at a train station in Prayagraj.",

    "story": [
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has inspected a facility that produces nuclear material and called for bolstering the country\u2019s nuclear capability, state media reports",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a facility that produces nuclear material and called for bolstering the country\u2019s nuclear fighting capability, state media reported Wednesday, as the North looks to increase pressure on the United States following the inauguration of President Donald Trump.",
      "Kim\u2019s visit suggests a continued emphasis on an expansion of North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal, though Trump has said he\u2019s willing to talk to Kim again to revive diplomacy. Many analysts view North Korean weapons moves as part of a strategy to win sanctions relief and political concessions from the United States.",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim visited the nuclear-material production base and the Nuclear Weapons Institute. It didn\u2019t say where those facilities are located, but North Korean photos of Kim\u2019s visit indicated that he likely visited a uranium-enrichment facility that he went to last September. That visit was North Korea\u2019s first disclosure of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one to visiting American scholars in 2010.",
      "During the latest visit, Kim said North Korea reported \u201camazing\" results in its production of nuclear material last year and underlined the need to exceed this year's production goal to strengthen \u201cthe nuclear shield of the country,\" according to KCNA.",
      "Kim said that further boosting the country's nuclear counteraction posture is \u201cour invariable noble task\u201d to cope with intensifying challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "The start of Trump\u2019s second term raises prospects for the resumption of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term. The Trump-Kim diplomacy  in 2018-19 fell apart due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea, and Kim has since significantly dialed up weapons testing activities.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "North Korea hasn't yet directly responded to Trump's overture as it continues its belligerent rhetoric against the U.S. along with weapons testing activities. Many experts say Kim could eventually sit down for talks with Trump and would likely think he now has greater leverage than before because of his enlarged nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "On Sunday, North Korea said it tested a cruise missile system, its third known weapons display this year, and vowed \u201cthe toughest\u201d response to what it called the escalation of U.S.-South Korean military drills.",
      "North Korea views U.S. military training with South Korea as invasion rehearsals, though Washington and Seoul have repeatedly said their drills are defensive in nature. In recent years, the United States and South Korea have expanded their military exercises in response to North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "During the September visit to the uranium-enrichment facility, Kim stressed the need to further augment the number of centrifuges to \u201cexponentially\" build more nucellar weapons.",
      "North Korea first unveiled a uranium enrichment site at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to a visiting delegation of American scholars in 2010. Many experts say the uranium enrichment facility disclosed in September was likely a different place from the one shown to the U.S. scholars.",
      "Nuclear weapons can be built using either highly enriched uranium or plutonium, and North Korea has a facility at Yongbyon to produce weapons-grade plutonium as well. Estimates of how many nuclear bombs North Korea can add every year vary, ranging from six to as many as 18.",
      "In 2018, a top South Korean official told parliament that North Korea was estimated to have already manufactured 20 to 60 nuclear weapons, but some experts say the North likely has more than 100.",

    "story": [
      "More than 375,000 Palestinians have made their way back to homes in northern Gaza after 15 months on the run because of war",
      "BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip -- The grove of orange, olive and palm trees that once stood in front of Ne\u2019man Abu Jarad\u2019s house was bulldozed away. The roses and jasmine flowers on the roof and in the garden, which he lovingly watered so his family could enjoy their fragrance, were also gone.",
      "The house itself was a damaged, hollowed-out shell. But after 15 months of brutal war, it stood.",
      "At the sight of it Monday, Ne\u2019man; his wife, Majida; and three of their six daughters dropped the bags they had been lugging since dawn, fell to their knees and prayed, whispering, \u201cPraise be to God, praise be to God.\u201d The sunset blazed orange in the sky above.",
      "After 477 days of hell \u2014 fleeing the length of the Gaza Strip, hiding from bombardment, sweltering in tents, scrounging for food and water, losing their possessions \u2013 they had finally returned home.",
      "\u201cOur joy is unmatched by any other, not the joy of success, of a marriage or of a birth,\u201d Majida said. \u201cThis is a joy that can\u2019t be described in words, in writing or in any expression.\u201d",
      "In October, at the one-year anniversary of the Gaza war, The Associated Press traced the Abu Jarad family's flight around the territory seeking safety. They were eight of the roughly 1.8 million Palestinians driven from their homes by Israel\u2019s massive campaign of retaliation against Hamas following the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel.",
      "Like many families, they were displaced multiple times. Ne\u2019man, Majida and their daughters \u2013 the youngest in first grade, the oldest in her early 20s \u2013 fled their home at the northernmost part of Gaza hours after Israeli bombardment began. They would move seven times in total, fleeing all the way to Gaza\u2019s southernmost city Rafah.",
      "Each time, their conditions worsened. By October 2024, they were languishing in a sprawling tent camp near the southern city of Khan Younis, exhausted and depressed, with little hope of seeing home again.",
      "Hope suddenly revived when Israel and Hamas reached a long-awaited ceasefire earlier this month. On Jan. 19, the first day of the truce, Majida began packing up their clothes, food and other belongings. On Sunday, the announcement came: The next day, Israeli troops would pull back from two main roads, allowing Palestinians to return to the north.",
      "Since Monday, more than 375,000 Palestinians have made their way back to northern Gaza, many of them on foot.",
      "The Abu Jarads set off Monday from their tent at 5 a.m., loading bags stuffed with their belongings into a car. The driver took them to the edge of the Netzarim Corridor, the swath of land across Gaza that Israeli forces had turned into a military zone that \u2013 until this week \u2013 had barred any returns north.",
      "There, they got out and walked, joining the massive crowds making their way down the coastal road. For around 8 kilometers (5 miles), the 49-year-old Ne\u2019eman carried one sack on his back, held another in his arms, and two bags dangled from the crooks of his elbows. They stopped frequently, to rest, rearrange bags, and drop items along the way.",
      "\u201cThe road is really hard,\u201d Majida told an AP journalist who accompanied them on the journey. \u201cBut our joy for the return makes us forget we\u2019re tired. Every meter we walk, our joy gives us strength to continue.\u201d",
      "Reaching the southern outskirts of Gaza City, they hired a van. But it quickly ran out of fuel, and they waited more than an hour before they found another one. Driving through the city, they got their first look at the war's devastating impact in the north.",
      "Over 15 months, Israel launched repeated offensives in Gaza City and surrounding areas, trying to crush Hamas fighters who often operated in densely populated neighborhoods. After each assault, militants would regroup, and a new assault would follow.",
      "The van made its way down city streets strewn with rubble, lined with buildings that were damaged husks or had been reduced to piles of concrete.",
      "\u201cThey destroyed even more in this area,\u201d Ne\u2019man said, staring out the window as they left Gaza City and entered the towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun \u2013 scene of one of Israel\u2019s most ferocious offensives in the last three months before the ceasefire.",
      "As the sun began to set, the van dropped them off at the edge of their neighborhood. Ne\u2019man\u2019s daughters stood in shock. One gaped, her hands on her cheeks. Her sister pointed out at the field of flattened houses. They walked the last few hundred meters, over a landscape of rutted, bulldozed dirt.",
      "Trudging as fast as he could under the bags draping from his body, Ne\u2019man \u2014 a taxi driver before the war \u2014 repeated over and over in excitement, \u201cGod is great, God is great. To God is all thanks.\u201d",
      "Their home still stood, sort of \u2014 a hollow shell in a row of damaged buildings. After they prayed in front of it, Ne\u2019eman leaned on the bare concrete wall of his house and kissed it. To his joy he discovered that one flowering vine in front of the house had miraculously survived. He immediately set about examining and arranging its tendrils.",
      "One of the girls dashed in through the now doorless front entrance. \u201cOh Lord, oh Lord,\u201d her gasps came from the darkness inside. Then she began to cry, as if all the shock, sorrow, happiness and relief were gushing out of her.",
      "Like others streaming back into northern Gaza, the Abu Jarads will face the question of how to survive in the ruins of cities decimated by war. Water and food remain scarce, leaving the population still reliant on humanitarian aid, which is being ramped up under the ceasefire. There is no electricity. Tens of thousands are homeless.",
      "Adjoining the Abu Jarads\u2019 home, Ne\u2019man\u2019s brother\u2019s three-story house is now a pile of concrete wreckage after it was destroyed by an airstrike. It damaged Ne\u2019man\u2019s home as it collapsed, \u201cbut, thank God, there is an undamaged room which we will live in,\u201d he said. He vows to repair what is damaged.",
      "Grief from the war lays heavily on him, Ne\u2019man said. His uncle lost his home, and several of his uncle's children were killed. Several of his neighbors\u2019 homes were destroyed. Ne\u2019man said he will have to walk several kilometers (miles) to find water, just like he did in the displacement camps.",
      "\u201cOnce again, we will live through suffering and fatigue.\u201d",

      "Syria\u2019s Civil Defense has uncovered over two dozen charred bodies in two basements in rural Damascus, adding to the growing tally of mass graves discovered since the ousting of Bashar Assad",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- The charred remains of at least 26 victims of the Bashar Assad government were located Tuesday by Syrian civil defense workers in two separate basements in rural Damascus.",
      "The discovery adds to the growing tally of mass graves unearthed since the fall of the Assad government in December. The remains, which are believed to include men, women and children, showed evidence of gunshot wounds and burning.",
      "Members of Syria\u2019s White Helmets, a volunteer civil defense group, exhumed the fragmented, weathered skeletal remains from the basement of two properties in the town of Sbeneh, southwest of the capital. Wearing hazmat suits, they carefully logged and coded each set of remains before placing them into body bags, which were then loaded onto trucks for transport.",
      "Since Nov. 28, the White Helmets have uncovered \"more than 780 bodies, most of unknown identity,\u201d Abed al-Rahman Mawwas, a member of the rescue service, told The Associated Press. He said many were found in shallow graves uncovered by locals or dug up by animals. The bodies are transferred to forensics doctors to determine their identities, time of death and cause of death, as well as to match them with possible family members.",
      "\u201cOf course, this takes years of work,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohammad al-Herafe, a resident of one of the buildings where remains were uncovered, said the stench of decomposing bodies was overwhelming when his family returned to Sbeneh in 2016 after fleeing because of fighting in the area during the country's uprising-turned-civil war that began in 2011.",
      "He said they found the bodies in the basement but chose not to report it out of fear of government reprisals. \u201cWe could not tell the regime about it because we know that the regime did this.\u201d",
      "The Assad government, which ruled Syria for over two decades, employed airstrikes on civilian areas, torture, executions and mass imprisonment, to maintain control over Syria and suppress opposition groups during the country's 13-year civil war.",
      "Ammar al-Salmo, another Civil Defense member dispatched to the second basement site, said further investigation is needed to identify the victims.",
      "\u201cWe need testimonies from residents and others who might know who stayed behind when the fighting intensified in 2013,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "Mohammad Shebat, who lived in the second building where bodies were found, said he left the neighborhood in 2012 and returned in 2020 when he and his neighbors discovered the bodies and demanded their removal. But no one cooperated, he said.",
      "Shebat believes the victims were civilians who fled the nearby Al-Assali neighborhood when the fighting escalated and the Assad government imposed a siege in 2013. He said forces of the former government used to \u201ctrap people in basements, burn them with tires and leave their bodies.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are several basements like this, full of skeletons,\" he said.",
      "In a report released Monday, the United Nations Syria Commission of Inquiry said that mass graves can be used as evidence to uncover the fates of thousands of missing detainees.",
      "The report, spanning 14 years of investigations and drawing on over 2,000 witness testimonies, including more than 550 survivors of torture, detailed how detainees in Syria\u2019s notorious prisons \u201csuffering from torture injuries, malnutrition, disease and illness, were left to die slowly, in agonizing pain, or were taken away to be executed.\u201d",
      "Assad's fall on Dec. 8 drove hundreds of families to scour prisons and morgues in desperate search of loved ones. While many were freed after years of imprisonment, thousands remain missing, their fates still unknown.",
      "The U.N. commission has said that forensic exhumations of mass graves, as well as safeguarding evidence, archives and crime sites, may offer grieving families a chance to learn the truth.",
      "The commission was established in 2011 by the Human Rights Council to investigate Syria\u2019s alleged violations of international human rights law.",

      "\u201cFor Syrians who did not find their loved ones among the freed, this evidence, alongside testimonies of freed detainees, may be their best hope to uncover the truth about missing relatives,\u201d said Commissioner Lynn Welchman.",

      "But Netanyahu has vowed to renew the war if Hamas doesn\u2019t meet his demands in negotiations over the ceasefire's second phase, meant to discuss a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a \u201csustainable calm.\"",
      "Under the deal, more than 375,000 Palestinians have crossed into northern Gaza since Israel allowed their return on Monday morning, the United Nations said Tuesday. That represents over a third of the million people who fled in the war\u2019s opening days.",

      "Serbia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned following weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy in November",
      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Serbia\u2019s populist Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned Tuesday in an attempt to calm political tensions and pressure roiled by weeks of massive anti-corruption protests over the deadly collapse of a concrete canopy.",
      "The canopy collapse in November, which killed 15 people in the northern city of Novi Sad, has become a flashpoint reflecting wider discontent with the increasingly autocratic rule of Serbia\u2019s populist President Aleksandar Vucic. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms in Serbia despite formally seeking European Union membership for the troubled Balkan nation.",
      "\u201cIt is my appeal for everyone to calm down the passions and return to dialogue,\u201d Vucevic told a news conference announcing his resignation.",
      "Novi Sad Mayor Milan Djuric also stepped down on Tuesday.",
      "Vucevic\u2019s resignation could lead to an early parliamentary election. The resignation must be confirmed by Serbia\u2019s parliament, which has 30 days to choose a new government or call a snap election.",
      "Pro-government media said President Vucic will attend a Cabinet session on Tuesday evening to decide whether a new prime minister-designate will be appointed or an early election called.",
      "Opposition parties have said they would insist on a transitional government that would create conditions for a free and fair election. Vucic's populists have faced accusations of irregularities during past elections.",
      "Vucevic became the prime minister in April 2024, after the Serbian Progressive Party won most votes in an election marred by tensions.",
      "\u201cThey (ruling party) have been in a free fall since the Novi Sad tragedy,\u201d journalist Slobodan Georgiev said on N1 television, adding that Vucic was seeking a \u201cbuffer\u201d with the prime minister's resignation.",
      "Vucic in the past had managed to cushion the impact of anti-government street protests, but the current student movement has garnered widespread support from all walks of life, including actors, farmers, lawyers and judges.",
      "The students' call for justice has resonated in a country where corruption is widespread and few feel that the state institutions work in the interests of citizens.",
      "Branimir Jovancicevic, professor at the Faculty of Chemistry in Belgrade, expressed hope that Vucevic's resignation is a first step toward further political changes in Serbia, where power is concentrated in the hands of the president although his constitutional role is largely ceremonial.",
      "\u201cIf the president thinks that by replacing one, essentially, unimportant figure ... will solve the problem ... he is deeply mistaken,\" said Jovancicevic. \u201dThis must lead to total political changes because autocracy and dictatorship in Serbia, in the heart of Europe, must be stopped.\u201d",
      "On Monday, tens of thousands of people joined striking university students in a 24-hour blockade of a key traffic intersection in the Serbian capital. Serbia's students are demanding accountability for the canopy collapse that critics have blamed on rampant government corruption.",
      "Classes at Serbia's universities and dozens of schools have been blocked for two months with students camping inside their faculty buildings.",
      "In another attempt to defuse tensions, Vucic, Vucevic and Parliament Speaker Ana Brnabic on Monday evening urged dialogue with the students, who have so far rebuffed such invitations. They say Vucic shouldn't be the one holding talks with them but that government institutions such as police and the judiciary should do their job.",
      "Vucevic said the immediate cause for his quitting was an attack on a female student in Novi Sad early Tuesday by assailants allegedly from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. Vucevic said that \u201cwhenever it seems there is hope to return to social dialogue, to talk ... it\u2019s like an invisible hand creates a new incident and tensions mount again.\u201d",
      "But the outgoing prime minister also said that the street protests \u201cundoubtedly\u201d have been organized from abroad \u201cwith an aim to directly jeopardize Serbia as a state.\u201d Vucevic offered no evidence for his claims that echoed earlier similar statements by Vucic.",
      "\u201cI can never justify or understand many of these protests, blockades of lives, of roads and the freedom of movement of other citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Students in Novi Sad said they were horrified by the assault they said was carried out by thugs with baseball bats. They attacked two groups of students and chased them in their car, the students said. Prosecutors later said that four people have been detained.",
      "\u201cWe are horrified over the state of our society where such a situation is possible,\u201d the students said in an Instagram post. \u201cWe have had enough of blood.\u201d",
      "The students called a big rally in Novi Sad later Tuesday in response to the attack.",
      "Serbia\u2019s prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people, including a government minister and several state officials for the November canopy collapse. But the former Construction Minister Goran Vesic, who had resigned shortly after the canopy crash, has been released from detention, fueling doubts over the investigation\u2019s independence.",
      "The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated and inaugurated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies and a fast railway link with neighboring Hungary.",
      "Several incidents have marred the street demonstrations in the past weeks, including drivers ramming in to the crowds on two occasions, when two young women were injured.",
      "Students and others have been holding daily 15-minute traffic blockades throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m., the exact same time the concrete canopy crashed down on Nov. 1. The blockades honor the 15 victims, including two children. The blockades were also held on Tuesday."

    "story": [
      "U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves says that the new Labour government is backing the construction of third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government is backing the construction of a third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Wednesday.",
      "Another runway at the U.K.\u2019s main airport will bolster the country\u2019s long-term economic growth potential, Reeves said in a speech.",
      "\u201cWe cannot duck the decision any longer,\" she said. \u201cThe case is stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Reeves said the government was inviting proposals over its construction by the summer and that it would then make a full assessment.",
      "\u201cThis will ensure that the project is value for money and our clear expectation is that any associated service transport costs will be financed through private funding,\u201d she said.",
      "For decades, campaigners, including from within her Labour Party, have opposed a third runway on environmental concerns. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and John McDonnell, the lawmaker whose constituency contains Heathrow, have both voiced their opposition to the third runway.",
      "Reeves insisted the runway will be \u201cdelivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate objectives.\"",
      "Heathrow\u2019s plan to build a third runway received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but has been delayed by legal challenges and the coronavirus pandemic. Heathrow's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, has said that he wouldn't continue developing the project without the government confirming that it wants expansion.",
      "Reeves' support for a third runway came in a wide-ranging speech on boosting U.K. growth rates, which have been historically low since the 2008 global financial crisis for a variety of reasons.",
      "The Labour government badly needs growth rates to increase over the coming years, so it can lift living standards following the cost-of-living crisis and to get money into ailing public services.",
      "Since taking office in July, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been criticized for talking down the economy and for increasing taxes on business, a combination that critics argue have led to a growth downturn in the past few months and the sharp downturn in the government's ratings in opinion polls.",
      "Though a third runway won't do much to bolster economic growth in the near-term as it would take up to a decade to build, Reeves hopes that the announcement itself will provide investors with a signal that the government is serious about turning the economy around.",
      "\u201cWe are not waiting for years into the future,\" she said. \u201cWe want to do things now, to turn around the performance, and we want to give businesses and investors confidence that this is a country to start doing things, to start making things in again.\u201d",
      "The construction of a third runway would require more than 700 houses to be demolished and sections of the M25 motorway, which encircles London, to be moved into a tunnel.",

    "story": [
      "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
      "KIKUYU, Kenya -- Tucked away in a lush, forested area of central Kenya's Kikuyu town, the National Seed Bank stands as a crucial safeguard for the future of the country's agriculture. Inside two chilly rooms of a government building, more than 50,000 seed varieties are cataloged and stored.",
      "The bank was established in 1988 after the realization that some traditional varieties of seeds were being lost, an occurrence that is becoming more common with climate change. It aims to conserve seeds for research and reintroduction to farms.",
      "\u201cWe realize that some of the traditional varieties that we had abandoned then are actually more resilient to climate change, so when you introduce them especially in marginal areas, those varieties outperform the improved varieties,\u201d said the director of the Genetic Resources Research Institute that operates the bank, Desterio Nyamongo, referring to hybrid seeds that must be bought every planting season.",
      "He said the some of bank\u2019s seeds also were found to be more resistant to diseases and pests and were high-yielding.",
      "This gives hope to a country that relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture instead of irrigation, leaving it more vulnerable to climate shocks like drought. The sector contributes a third of Kenya's GDP.",
      "Kenya is not alone facing food security pressures. According to a U.N Food and Agriculture and Organization report in 2023, over a billion people across the African continent are unable to afford healthy diets, and the number of hungry people is increasing.",
      "But in Kenya, another complication has emerged. Farmers in recent months suffered losses in the millions of shillings (tens of thousands of dollars) after planting counterfeit seeds bought from private sellers.",
      "Kenyan officials have acknowledged that the seed sector is critical.",
      "During the country\u2019s first international seed quality conference in August, the agriculture ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, Paul Rono, said Africa has limited capacity to produce high-quality certified seeds that are subjected to quality standards.",
      "The head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation, Stephen Muchiri, said the vigor of crops in Kenya has become low, and he believes that the main reason is a flawed seed breeding and propagation program.",
      "But some farmers say efforts to improve the seed system in Kenya have been limited by a 2012 law banning seed sharing, which is what millions of farmers did every planting season to cut their production cost.",
      "The government has said the law is meant to prevent the circulation of uncertified seeds and protects farmers, but it faces a court challenge from more than a dozen farmers across Kenya who say it's expensive having to buy new seeds every planting season. The next hearing in the case is in March.",
      "Francis Ngiri is one of the farmers who filed the case. He runs an indigenous seed bank for the local community on his five-acre farm in the semi-arid Gilgil area located 120 kilometers (74 miles) from the capital, Nairobi.",
      "His work has become a learning ground for farmers who have experienced disappointing yields from hybrid seeds.",
      "\u201cWe have seen that indigenous seeds are more resilient and perform better in our area even when there is reduced rainfall,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "He passionately shares his knowledge on conserving the seeds using traditional methods such as covering them with wood ash \u2014 believed to repel weevils \u2014 or keeping them in earthen pots. He emphasized the use of locally available materials at no cost.",
      "Farmer Maximilla Onyura, who farms sorghum in the western county of Busia, said indigenous crops offer a food security solution. She isn't part of the legal challenge but collaborates with Ngiri through a Kenyan organization called the Seed Savers Network.",
      "However, \u201cinstead of our government encouraging those offering solutions through indigenous crops, they are now cracking down on those sharing seeds at community level,\u201d she said.",
      "Seed sharing in Kenya can bring two years in prison, a fine of up to 1 million Kenyan shillings ($7,700), or both. No farmer has been charged.",
      "The National Seed Bank occasionally distributes some of its collection to farmers at no cost in the hope that the varieties that had long adopted to local conditions will be more resilient.",
      "The director, Nyamongo, said farmers who cannot afford farm inputs like fertilizers required for hybrid seeds are better off planting the traditional varieties.",
      "\u201cIt would be wrong for farmers, especially farmers in marginal areas, to start thinking that using the indigenous seed is backwardness,\u201d he said. \u201cFar from it, because some of the indigenous varieties have adopted over time to the local conditions and therefore, they are more resilient.\u201d",
      "Nyamongo did not comment on the farmers' court challenge to the seed-sharing ban.",
      "The president of the Dutch-based climate change adaptation nonprofit Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick V. Verkooijen, said governments can invest in community-based seed programs to preserve a diversity of indigenous varieties.",
      "\u201cIndigenous crop varieties offer many benefits, particularly their genetic diversity, which helps farmers adapt to climate change, combat pests and diseases and manage poor soil fertility. However, they also come with challenges, such as potentially lower yields or susceptibility to new pests and diseases,\u201d he said.",
      "Kenyan proponents of indigenous seeds like Ngiri said lower yields and susceptibility to new pests and diseases only happen when a seed variety is taken from its native location.",
      "\u201cThe reason why they are indigenous is because they have adapted to the climatic conditions and the diseases found in the area they originally came from,\u201d Ngiri said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump talked tough about imposing tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods and threatened to renew the trade war with China that he launched during his first term.",
      "But now that he's back in the White House, Trump appears to be seeking a more nuanced relationship with the country that both Republicans and Democrats have come to see as the gravest foreign policy challenge to the U.S. China is also a major trading partner and an economic powerhouse, and it has one of the world\u2019s largest military forces.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China,\u201d Trump said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in comments that suggested Beijing could help end the war in Ukraine and reduce nuclear arms.",
      "As he moves forward with plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, Trump has not set a firm date for China. He\u2019s only repeated his plan for a much lower 10% tax on Chinese imports in retaliation for China's production of chemicals used in fentanyl. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was \u201cvery much still considering\" raising tariffs on China on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump, who spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping days before taking office, seems to be showing restraint and bowing to a more complicated reality than he described while running for office. Speaking of potential tariffs on China in a recent Fox News interview, he said: \u201cThey don\u2019t want them, and I\u2019d rather not have to use it.\u201d",
      "Liu Yawei, senior adviser on China at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said Trump has become \u201cmore pragmatic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe signaling, at least from the election to the inauguration, seems to be more positive than has been expected before,\u201d Liu said. \u201cHopefully, this positive dynamic can be preserved and continued. Being more pragmatic, less ideological will be good for everyone.\u201d",
      "A Chinese expert on American foreign policy acknowledged that there are many \u201cuncertainties and unknowns about the future\" of U.S.-China relations. But Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, also said Trump's recent change in tone offers \"encouraging signals.\u201d",
      "When Trump first became president in 2017, Xi and Trump got off to a good start. Xi was invited to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. A few months later, he treated Trump to a personal tour of the Palace Museum in the heart of Beijing, only to see Trump launch the trade war the following year.",
      "The U.S.-China relationship soured further over the COVID-19 pandemic, and it hardly improved during President Joe Biden's administration, which saw a controversial visit to the self-governing island of Taiwan by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a Chinese spy balloon aloft over U.S. territory.",
      "Biden kept Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and intensified the economic and technological rivalry with export controls, investment curbs and alliance building.",
      "Now it will be up to Trump's top diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to help chart a new path for the second term.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Rubio said China has \u201clied, cheated, hacked and stolen\u201d its way to global superpower status \u201cat our expense.\" He called China \u201cthe most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\u201d",
      "Hours after he was sworn in, Rubio met foreign ministers from Australia, Japan and India, sending signals that he would continue to work with the same group of countries that Biden elevated to blunt China\u2019s expanding influence and aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Yet Rubio, who was twice sanctioned by Beijing and is known for his hawkish views on the Chinese Communist Party, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. should engage with China because \u201cit's in the interest of global peace and stability.\u201d",
      "In a Friday phone call, China's veteran foreign minister issued a veiled warning to Rubio, telling him to behave. Wang Yi conveyed the message in their first conversation since Rubio\u2019s confirmation.",
      "\u201cI hope you will act accordingly,\u201d Wang told Rubio, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement that included a Chinese phrase typically used by a teacher or a boss warning a student or employee to be responsible for their actions. Rubio agreed to manage bilateral relations in a \u201cmature and prudent\u201d way, the ministry said.",
      "Members of Congress have noted Trump's seemingly softer attitude toward Beijing.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, wants to ensure \"that Trump does not let China off too easy.\u201d She urged the president to act now on measures that have won broad bipartisan support, including closing a tariff loophole on low-value packages, reviewing outbound investments and setting up a domestic industrial policy agenda.",
      "Beijing is seeking opportunities to create more breathing room in its relations with a U.S. president known for his transactional style. Chinese leaders are betting on engaging with Trump directly when his Cabinet members and advisers appear to hold clashing views.",
      "Trump \"is the most important person above all those different voices, and he can at least set the tone of future policy,\u201d Da said.",
      "The Tsinghua professor expects Trump and Xi to meet at some point. Effective communication channels will be crucial, Da said, to keep differences from spiraling out of control, as they did in Trump's first term.",
      "\u201cThe two presidents can have a good starting point. That\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then we need to set up some mechanisms to let the cabinet-level members talk to each other.\u201d",
      "That may explain Beijing's friendly overture at the start of the second Trump administration. In response to Trump's inauguration invitation, Xi sent a special representative.",
      "Beijing has also signaled a willingness to be flexible on the future of TikTok, which Trump sought to ban during his first administration. But he has now come to the social media app's rescue, offering more time for its Chinese-based parent company to sell and downplaying TikTok\u2019s national security risks.",
      "After Trump said he preferred not to use tariffs on China, the Chinese Foreign Ministry echoed that trade and economic cooperation between the two countries are mutually beneficial.",
      "But Beijing is also ready to play tough, if necessary, after learning a lesson from Trump's first term.",
      "Over the past several years, Beijing has adopted laws and rules that allow it to retaliate quickly and forcefully to any hostile act from the U.S. In its toolbox are tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, measures to limit companies from doing business in China and regulatory reviews aimed at inflicting pain on American businesses and the U.S. economy.",

      "President Donald Trump has fired two of the three Democratic commissioners of the federal agency that enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, an unprecedented move aimed at implementing his crackdown on certain diversity and gender rights policies",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- President Donald Trump fired two of the three Democratic commissioners of the federal agency that enforces civil rights law in the workplace, an unprecedented move aimed at implementing his crackdown on certain diversity and gender rights policies.",
      "The two commissioners of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Charlotte Burrows and Jocelyn Samuels, confirmed in statements Tuesday that they were fired late Monday night. Both said they were exploring options to challenge their dismissals, calling their removal before the expiration of their five-year terms an unprecedented decision that undermines the agency's independence.",
      "In a similar move, National Labor Relations Board member Gynne A. Wilcox and General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo were also fired late last night, the agency confirmed. Wilcox was the first Black woman to serve on the Board since its inception in 1935, according to the NLRB website.",
      "The EEOC was created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a bipartisan five-member panel to protect workers from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability and other protected characteristics. The U.S. president appoints the commissioners and the Senate confirms them, but their terms are staggered and are meant to overlap presidential terms to help ensure the agency's independence.",
      "The two firings leave the agency with one Republican commissioner, Andrea Lucas, who Trump appointed acting EEOC chair last week, one Democratic commissioner, Kalpana Kotagal, and three vacancies that Trump can fill. Another Republican commissioner, Keith Sonderling, resigned after Trump appointed him Deputy Secretary of Labor.",
      "The EEOC panel investigates and imposes penalties on employers found to have violated laws that protect workers from racial, gender, disability and other forms of discrimination. The agency also writes influential rules and guidelines for how anti-discrimination laws should be implemented, and conducts workplace outreach and training.",
      "In recent years, the agency's Democratic and Republican commissioners have been sharply divided on many issues. Both Republican commissioners voted against new guidelines last year stating that misgendering transgender employees, or denying access to a bathroom consistent with their gender identity, would violate anti-discrimination laws. The Republican commissioners also voted against regulations stating that employers must give workers time off and other accommodations for abortions under the new Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.",
      "The firing of Burrows and Samuels appears aimed at positioning the EEOC to aggressively crack down on employers with diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 or DEI \u2014 policies that the Trump administration believes veer into discrimination in their attempts to support racial minorities, women and other groups.",
      "Lucas, the new acting EEOC chair, issued a statement last week saying that she would prioritize \u201crooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination; protecting American workers from anti-American national origin discrimination; defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights, including women\u2019s rights to single\u2011sex spaces at work.\u201d",
      "The three Democratic commissioners in contrast all issued statements last week condemning a slew of executive orders aimed at ending DEI practices in the federal workforce and private companies, along with protections for transgender workers. Their statements also emphasized that U.S. anti-discrimination laws remained intact despite Trump's orders and that the EEOC must continue enforcing them.",
      "Burrows, who has been an EEOC commissioner since 2015, said in her statement Tuesday that the dismissal of two Democratic commissioners before their terms ended \u201cundermine the efforts of this independent agency to do the important work of protecting employees from discrimination, supporting employers\u2019 compliance efforts, and expanding public awareness and understanding of federal employment laws.\u201d",
      "Samuels, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, said her removal \u201cviolates the law, and represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the EEOC as an independent agency \u2013 one that is not controlled by a single Cabinet secretary but operates as a multi-member body whose varying views are baked into the Commission\u2019s design.\u201d",
      "The firings drew swift condemnation from civil rights groups and organizations that promote the advancement of women in the workforce.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s outrageous firings send a cruel message that not all workers can count on the EEOC. Under the EEOC envisioned by Trump, the government will no longer have your back if you are a transgender or gay worker seeking fair treatment. And if you are a person of color or a woman, your success at work is evidence of \u2018illegal DEI,\u2019\u201d said Gaylynn Burroughs, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, condemned the firing of the EEOC commissioners and NLRB members. \u201cThese are yet more lawless actions by a president who thinks he is above the law and clearly could not care less about the rights of workers,\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "The show\u2019s setting, within the palazzo Armani and beneath gold-gilded ceilings, provided an intimate yet majestic backdrop for the celebration. Guests, including Demi Moore and Jessica Biel, were seen to tap their feet to the booming music.",
      "While the collection embraced Armani\u2019s signature balance of creativity and restraint, some pieces leaned on familiar themes, reflecting the designer\u2019s adherence to his established aesthetic. Yet, this sense of continuity only heightened the timeless quality of the designs, reminding the audience why Priv\u00e9 remains a key part of the haute couture calendar.",
      "The emotional highlight of the evening came at the finale when Giorgio Armani himself emerged to take his bow. Slowly walking the runway, the nonagenarian designer received a standing ovation from some in the audience, many of whom were visibly emotional by the moment."

In December, Fed officials signaled they may reduce their rate just twice more this year. Goldman Sachs economists believes those cuts won't happen until June and December.",
      "A cut in March is still possible, though financial markets' futures pricing puts the odds of that happening at just one-third.",
      "As a result, American households and businesses are unlikely to see much relief from high borrowing costs anytime soon. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage slipped to just below 7% last week after rising for five straight weeks. The costs of borrowing money have remained high economywide even after the Fed reduced its benchmark rate.",
      "That is because investors expect healthy economic growth and stubborn inflation will forestall future rate cuts. They recently bid up the 10-year Treasury above 4.80%, its highest level since 2023.",
      "Another reason for caution among Fed policymakers this year is that they will want to evaluate any changes in economic policy by the Trump administration. Trump has said he could slap tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico as early as Feb. 1. During his presidential campaign he threatened to impose taxes on all imports.",
      "The Trump administration has also said it will carry out mass deportations of migrants, which could push up inflation by reducing the economy's ability to produce goods and services. At the same time, some economists say Trump's promises to deregulate the economy could lower prices over time.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs on a limited number of imports in 2018 and 2019, Fed economists expected the biggest impact to fall on economic growth, with the inflationary impact being relatively minor. As a result, when growth did slow, the Fed ended up cutting its key rate in 2019, rather than raising it to fight off any inflationary impact.",
      "On Wednesday, Fed officials could also change the statement that they release after each meeting to upgrade their assessment of the labor market, a signal that rate cuts may be delayed.",
      "In December, the statement included a mildly pessimistic take: \"Labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.\u201d In the summer and fall, employers slowed their hiring. The rise in the unemployment rate had unnerved Fed officials and was a big reason they reduced their key rate by an unusually large half-percentage point in September.",
      "Earlier this month, Fed governor Chris Waller cited weaker hiring as evidence that the Fed's key rate is \u201crestrictive,\u201d meaning it is acting as a brake on the economy and should bring down inflation over time. If rates are restrictive, that means the Fed would have more room to cut them if inflation were to decline further.",
      "Yet this month, just a few days after Waller's remarks, the December jobs report showed that hiring accelerated and the unemployment rate slipped to a low 4.1% from 4.2%.",
      "The healthier employment numbers suggested that hiring has at least levelled off. If it stays as strong as last month, the improved job gains would suggest the Fed's rate isn't restrictive at all, and few, if any, rate cuts are needed."

    "story": [
      "The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature has asked that a liberal state Supreme Court justice step aside in a pending case that seeks to overturn a 2011 law that effectively ended collective bargaining for most state workers",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature on Tuesday asked that a liberal state Supreme Court justice step aside in a pending case that seeks to overturn a 2011 law that effectively ended collective bargaining for most state workers.",
      "If Justice Janet Protasiewicz agrees not to hear the case, the court would be deadlocked 3-3 between liberals and conservatives. The lawsuit has massive implications for union rights in the battleground state, the court would be deadlocked 3-3 between liberals and conservatives.",
      "A Dane County Circuit judge last month overturned the bulk of the law, saying it violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d employees. Under the ruling, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power would have it restored to what was in place before 2011.",
      "The judge put the ruling on hold pending the appeal. School workers unions that brought the lawsuit have asked the Supreme Court to take it directly, skipping the appeals court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, controlled 4-3 by liberals, has not yet decided whether to take the case.",
      "Republicans enacted the law in the face of massive protests 14 years ago that made Wisconsin the center of the national fight over union rights. The debate also catapulted then-Gov. Scott Walker onto the national stage, sparked an unsuccessful recall campaign and laid the groundwork for his failed 2016 presidential bid. The law\u2019s adoption led to a dramatic decrease in union membership across the state.",
      "Protasiewicz is the court's newest member and ran in 2023 as an opponent of the union law, known as Act 10. Her victory gave liberals the majority on the court for the first time in 15 years. That majority is on the line again in the April 1 Supreme Court election to fill the seat of a retiring liberal justice.",
      "Protasiewicz said during the campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against it and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "The Legislature's top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said Tuesday that it would be \u201cright and ethical\u201d for her to step aside.",
      "Protasiewicz did not return an email from The Associated Press asking if she would recuse herself, a decision that is entirely hers.",
      "She is not the only justice on the court with a potential conflict.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting Act 10. During his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court.",
      "No request has been filed for Hagedorn to step aside.",
      "If both Protasiewicz and Hagedorn recused themselves, liberals would have a 3-2 advantage.",
      "The attorney for the unions that brought the lawsuit did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",
      "Supporters of the law have said it provided local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.",
      "Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions."

      "Crown, an imprint of Penguin Random House, announced the book Tuesday. The title and release date are still to be determined.",
      "\u201cIn this candid work, he will offer the first inside story from within the administration on what really transpired in the run up to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the difficult choices that shaped American diplomatic and military support in the months that followed in a war that would bring the world as close to nuclear conflict as it had come in more than half a century,\u201d Crown's statement reads in part.",

He was a foreign policy adviser to Joe Biden during the 2020 election and was secretary of state through all four years of the Biden administration, a time of conflicts around the world.",
      "Blinken and the Biden administration were often criticized for their handling of the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and for their support for Israel in its war against Hamas. Critics and protesters contended they did not impose meaningful restrictions on weapons shipments to Israel or push its ally hard enough to ease a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Protesters interrupted his final State Department briefing and at other times gathered outside of his home.",
      "In an Associated Press interview on his last workday, Blinken said that he hoped his legacy would include building \u201ca new and stronger foundation for the United States in the world for the future.\u201d He also acknowledged sharp differences with the incoming Trump administration over Biden's support for Ukraine and the NATO alliance, among other issues.",
      "\u201cWhen we came in, we inherited partnerships and alliances that were seriously frayed,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if past is prologue, yes, it would be a concern.\u201d",
      "Terms for Blinken's deal were not disclosed. Negotiations were handled by Esther Newberg of the Creative Artists Agency, which also has worked with Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris."

      "WASHINGTON -- Boeing posted a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion on Tuesday as a machinists strike and other problems continued to plague the troubled aircraft manufacturer.",
      "Boeing has lost more than $35 billion since 2019 following the crashes of two then-new Max jets that killed 346 people. For the full year 2024, Boeing logged a loss of $11.8 billion.",
      "The numbers Boeing released are in line with what the company pre-reported last week, including nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the period due to the labor stoppage, job cuts and problems with a number of government programs.",
      "Boeing's loss per share was $5.46 per share, well above the $3.08 loss that Wall Street analysts expected, according to the data firm FactSet.",
      "The fourth quarter caps a rough year for Boeing. A strike by the machinists who assemble the best-selling 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing\u2019s delivery capability.",
      "The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raises and improved benefits.",
      "The company reiterated much of what it reported in last week's release, including that it took charges totaling $1.1 billion related to the 777 and 767 programs in the fourth quarter. Boeing took an additional $1.7 billion in charges related to a number of government programs including a military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets.",
      "Boeing said revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $15.2 billion, below analysts\u2019 updated estimate of $15.7 billion, according to FactSet. Full-year revenue came in at $66.5 billion, a 14$ decline from 2023.",
      "As it also reported earlier this month, Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners last year, more than a third fewer than the 528 the company finished for airlines and leasing outfits in 2023 and less than half the number of jetliners that Airbus delivered last year.",
      "Deliveries are an important source of cash for plane manufacturers since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase price when their orders are fulfilled.",
      "More than three-quarters of the planes that Boeing furnished were 737 Max jets, a reminder of how integral its best-selling airline model has been to the company\u2019s fortunes and challenges.",

      "The hit to the company\u2019s finances and reputation extended to sales of new aircraft. Boeing received no 737 Max orders for at least two months and ended the year far behind Airbus in total net orders for commercial planes, an indicator that factors in cancellations.",

      "President Donald Trump has already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening tariffs and is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday",
      "WASHINGTON -- Having already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening a 25% tariff, President Donald Trump is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday.",
      "But this time, the stakes are higher and many economists surveying the possible damage doubt Trump would be comfortable with what they say would be self-inflicted wounds from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe potential for such sizable economic impacts ought to act as enough of a deterrent that Trump will not end up implementing these higher tariffs,\u201d said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.",
      "Trump has repeatedly insisted that tariffs are coming on Canada and Mexico, despite both countries seeking to address his stated concerns about illegal border crossings and the smuggling of fentanyl. But the Republican president is also motivated by the idea that tariffs would force other countries to \u201crespect\u201d the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to immediately install massive tariffs,\" Trump said in a Monday speech, adding, \u201cColombia is traditionally a very, very strong-willed country,\u201d but it backed down rather than face import taxes.",
      "Multiple economic analyses show that universal tariffs against Canada and Mexico risk more inflation and an economic slowdown. It's a much larger play than Trump's moves against Colombia, which accounts for roughly 0.5% of U.S. imports. By contrast, nearly 30% of all U.S. imports hail from Canada and Mexico, amplifying the risk that tariffs could fuel inflation and undermine Trump's campaign promises to get prices under control.",
      "Trump's director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, dismissed these concerns. He said the skeptical analyses of tariffs don't look at the totality of Trump's promises.",
      "\u201cWhen the people who are trying to cause panic over President Trump\u2019s trade policy simulate what it\u2019s going to do, they don\u2019t account for all the other policies,\u201d Hassett said in a Monday interview on the Fox Business Network. \u201cSo President Trump is drill, baby, drill, and deregulate and tax cuts and reduce spending.\u201d",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial threat of 25% tariffs in November, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own. Since then, she has been more measured, choosing to emphasize the strong bilateral relationship and willingness to engage in dialogue as the number of detentions at the U.S.-Mexico border has plunged.",
      "Sheinbaum pointed out in November that drugs were a U.S. problem, but in December the Mexican military seized more than a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids, calling it the biggest catch of synthetic opioids in Mexico\u2019s history.",
      "On Monday, Sheinbaum applauded the agreement reached by the Trump administration and Colombia.",
      "\u201cI believe the important thing, as I said on the first day, is to always act with a cool head, defending each country\u2019s sovereignty and the respect among nations and peoples,\u201d she said.",
      "Top Canadian ministers said last week that Canada was prepared to retaliate if Trump imposed import taxes, even as Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said they \u201cwill continue to work on preventing tariffs.\u201d The working theory in Canada appears to involve being ready for anything that the U.S. president might do.",
      "On Monday, the economics division of the insurance company Nationwide estimated that Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would increase inflation by as much as 0.5 percentage points and pull down growth by 0.7 percentage points.",
      "The analysis noted it did not \u201caccount for potential retaliatory tariffs from Canada or Mexico, which could amplify the deleterious impact on inflation and GDP growth.\u201d",
      "Trump has made lower gasoline prices one of his key strategies for tackling inflation, but tariffs on Canada could drive up prices at the pump unless Trump creates carveouts in his plan.",
      "\u201cFor example, 60% of oil and gas imports come from Canada,\" said Oxford Economics' Martin. \"A 25% tariff would lead to higher gasoline, diesel, and petroleum product prices for households and firms, especially in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where refineries are connected to Canada by pipeline.\u201d",
      "The tax services firm PwC looked at the possible impact of 25% tariffs and found that companies importing from Canada could have to pay $106 billion more annually in import taxes and those importing from Mexico could owe $131 billion more.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about hardest-hit industries, we think about transportation and automotive,\u201d said Chris Desmond, a principal at PwC's international trade practice. \u201cThe amount of companies that have operations in Mexico and Canada in that industry with components and parts as well, including even airplanes, that\u2019s going to be a huge hit.\u201d",
      "Desmond estimates that taxes paid on imports in the transportation sector from all of Trump's tariff plans, which include new taxes on China and other countries, could increase from $4 billion a year to $68 billion. It's unclear how companies would absorb those costs or possibly pass them along to consumers.",
      "None of those analyses is at the forefront of Trump's public thoughts. His argument is that tariffs would make the U.S. wealthy by sheltering it from competition and safer because they could be tools to force other countries to reduce illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cTariffs, I told you, most beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d Trump said Monday as he recalled his campaign speeches praising the import taxes. He reminisced in that speech how he was criticized for praising the term, prompting him to conclude that tariff is, in fact, the fourth most beautiful word after \u201cGod, love, religion.\u201d"

It had been traveling from the United Arab Emirates' Jebel Ali port in Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, before beginning to drift Tuesday.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what caused the fire in the Red Sea, which has been repeatedly targeted by attacks from the Houthis. The rebels said last week they were limiting their assaults following a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the fire incident.",
      "The vessel was abandoned and the crew later rescued unharmed, another maritime industry official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as authorization hadn't been given to speak publicly about the incident.",
      "The official described the cargo aboard the vessel as \u201cdangerous,\u201d without immediately elaborating. The ultimate owner of the ASL Bauhinia, CSSC Hong Kong Shipping Co. Ltd., could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.",
      "The Red Sea is home to coral and marine life that previously has been threatened by burning ships from the Houthi campaign and the threat of wider oil spills.",
      "The Houthi attacks, which began in November 2023, have halved the number of ships passing through the Red Sea corridor, a crucial route for energy shipments and cargo moving between Asia and Europe. Despite the pledge by the Houthis to limit their attacks, shippers broadly are still shying away from the route over the risks.",

      "General Motors swung to a loss in the fourth quarter on huge charges related to China, but still topped profit and revenue expectations on Wall Street. The automaker is also taking a proactive approach with the United States government on regulations and doling out generous profit-sharing payouts to thousands of workers.",
      "Last month GM cautioned that the poor performance of its Chinese joint ventures would force it to write down assets and take a restructuring charge totaling more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter.",
      "China has become an increasingly difficult market for foreign automakers, with BYD and other domestic companies raising the quality of their vehicles and reducing costs. The country has subsidized its automakers.",
      "For the three months ended Dec. 31, GM lost $2.96 billion, or $1.64 per share. A year earlier the company earned $2.1 billion, or $1.59 per share.",
      "Stripping out the charges and other items, GM earned $1.92 per share in the quarter. That topped the $1.85 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.",
      "Revenue climbed to $47.7 billion from $42.98 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $44.98 billion.",
      "In a letter to shareholders, CEO Mary Barra said that GM doubled its electric vehicle market share over the course of 2024 as it scaled production. She noted that China had positive equity income in the fourth quarter before restructuring costs and that GM is taking steps with its partner to improve from there.",
      "In the U.S., Barra said that hourly employees once again earned the industry\u2019s highest profit sharing, totaling more than $640 million. Workers will receive a payout of up to $14,500 per person, which Barra said is equal to more than two months of extra pay on average for its United Auto Workers-represented employees.",
      "Barra said that while there's uncertainty over trade, tax, and environmental regulations in the United States, GM has been proactive with Congress and the administration of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cIn our conversations, we have stressed the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and American leadership in advanced technologies,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that we share a lot of common ground, and we appreciate the dialogue.\u201d",
      "Wedbush's Dan Ives said in a note to clients that GM delivered a strong end to 2024 and is continuing to see major benefits from its investments.",
      "\u201cWe believe this was another major step in the right direction as management continues to navigate the choppy waters in this EV macro while the turnaround story for GM continues with management successfully balancing production and profitability to generate durable profitable growth over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.",
      "This year, GM will offer three new Cadillac EVs, the Escalade IQ, Optiq and Vistiq. Barra said that the automaker will also see the full-year impact of new gas-powered SUVs launched in 2024, which includes the Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia.",
      "Barra noted that regardless of what happens in the U.S., GM has \u201ca broad and deep portfolio of ICE vehicles and EVs that are both growing market share, and we\u2019ll be agile and execute as efficiently as possible.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead, GM anticipates 2025 adjusted earnings in a range of $11 to $12 per share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet are calling for full-year earnings of $10.86 per share."

      "Hospitals are overwhelmed in Goma, while hundreds of thousands are fleeing gunfire and shelling, the officials said.",
      "Dozens of demonstrators, meanwhile, attacked several foreign embassies, including those of Rwanda, France and Belgium far off in the capital, Kinshasa, demanding that they condemn Rwanda over its role in the major escalation in one of Africa\u2019s longest conflicts driven by ethnic tensions.",
      "The M23 rebels are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the conflict-battered North Kivu province \u2014 which includes Goma \u2014 rich in minerals critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "There were reports of gender-based violence and rape committed by fighters, looting of property, including a humanitarian warehouse, and humanitarian and health facilities being hit in the city, U.N. humanitarian affairs office spokesman Jens Laerke said at a media briefing on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe humanitarian situation in and around Goma remains extremely worrying, and this morning (there were) heavy small arms fire and mortar fire across the city and the presence of many dead bodies in the streets,\u201d said Laerke, adding that hospitals are \u201cstruggling to manage the influx of wounded people.\u201d",
      "In the capital, Kinshasa, police fired tear gas at protesters as they looted and set fires to parts of the embassy buildings. The embassies of Kenya and Uganda were also attacked, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene.",
      "The protesters demanded that the international community pressure Rwanda over the rebel advance.",
      "\u201cWe denounce the hypocrisy of the international community,\" said Timoth\u00e9e Tshishimbi, one of the protesters. \"They must tell Rwanda to stop this adventure.\u201d",
      "The attacks were condemned by the respective countries. Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in a statement on X that the National Police have restored order and reinforced the security at the embassies.",
      "Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said at least five people in Rwanda have been killed and 35 others wounded in shelling from Congo. He also told the AP that while the country has \u201cbehaved well\u201d since the rebels entered Goma, \u201cwe have been shelled by the military coalition\u201d of the Congolese army and its allies.",
      "Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi \"will have to accept talks with M23 to end the situation once and for all,\u201d Nduhungirehe added.",
      "While Rwanda denies that it's supporting M23 rebels, it acknowledged last year that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo, allegedly to safeguard its security. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.",
      "The country\u2019s goal in Congo is to protect its borders against attacks, Rwandan army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Ronald Rwivanga told the AP, adding that appropriate measures would be \u201call-encompassing,\u201d including the use of water, air and land defense.",
      "Goma is a regional trade and humanitarian hub that is a refuge for hundreds of thousands of the more than 6 million people displaced by eastern Congo's prolonged conflict over ethnic tensions that have resulted in one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "The M23 rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012 before being forced to pull out under international pressure, and resurfaced in late 2021 with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo\u2019s government and U.N. experts. Rwanda has denied such support.",
      "It was unclear how much of Goma is controlled by the rebels, who marched into the city early Monday to both fear and cheers among residents. It was the culmination of weeks of fighting during which the rebels captured several towns in a shocking advance.",
      "\u201cSince morning, we have heard bomb explosions and crackling bullets,\u201d said Sam Luwawa, a resident of Goma. \u201cSo far we cannot say who really controls the city.\u201d",
      "Three South African peacekeepers were killed on Monday when the rebels launched a mortar shell toward the Goma airport which landed on the nearby South African National Defense Force, while a fourth soldier succumbed to injuries sustained in fighting days ago, the South African Department of Defense said Tuesday.",
      "That makes 17 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers who have been killed in the fighting, according to U.N. and army officials.",
      "The humanitarian situation in Goma \u201cis extremely, extremely worrying, with a new threshold of violence and suffering reached today,\u201d Bruno Lemarquis, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Congo, told reporters in a video news conference on Monday. He said that hundreds of thousands of people were attempting to flee the violence.",

Power and water have reportedly been cut to many areas of the city,\u201d said David Munkley, head of operations in eastern Congo for the Christian aid group World Vision.",
      "In addition to the U.N., several countries including the United States, United Kingdom and France have condemned Rwanda for the rebel advance.

      "Cage-free egg laws in 10 states may also be responsible for some supply disruptions and price increases. The laws set minimum space for chickens or cage-free requirements for egg-laying hens. They\u2019ve already gone into effect in California, Massachusetts, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan. At a Target in Chicago on Monday, a dozen large conventional eggs cost $4.49 but a dozen large cage-free eggs were selling for $6.19.",
      "Bird flu is primarily spread by wild birds such as ducks and geese as they migrate. While it is fatal to a variety of animals, those species can generally carry it without getting sick, which offers the virus a chance to mutate and thrive.",
      "The virus can be spread through droppings or any interaction between farm-raised poultry and wild birds. It's also easily tracked into a farm on someone's boots or by vehicle.",
      "Unlike previous outbreaks, the one that began in 2022 didn't die out in high summer temperatures.",
      "The virus found another new host when dairy cattle started getting sick last March. That creates more opportunities for the virus to linger and spread and unlike poultry, cattle aren\u2019t slaughtered when they get sick because they rarely die from bird flu.",
      "More than five dozen people have also become ill with bird flu and one person died since last March. Nearly all of them worked around sick animals. Health officials haven\u2019t yet found evidence of the disease spreading from person to person.",
      "Farmers go to great lengths to protect their flocks.",
      "Many poultry farms installed truck washes to disinfect vehicles entering their property and require workers to shower and change clothes before stepping inside a barn. They have also invested in duplicate sets of tools so nothing used in one barn is shared.",
      "Some poultry farmers have even invested in lasers that shoot beams of green light in random patterns to discourage ducks and geese from landing.",
      "Dairy farmers isolate any sick cattle and do additional testing before moving animals off the farm \u2014 especially if there has been a nearby outbreak or if the cows are being sent to a meat processing plant. The government is also testing milk.",
      "Future vaccines might help, but it's not practical to vaccinate millions of chickens through shots, and other countries might refuse to purchase meat from vaccinated birds.",
      "Health officials emphasize that any sick birds or cattle are kept out of the food supply. Cooking meat to 165 degrees (74 Celsius) kills bird flu, E. coli, salmonella or anything else. Pasteurization also kills the virus in milk. Raw milk is the only food product linked to illnesses so far.",
      "It is impossible to know how much farmers have spent to seal barns, build shower houses for workers or to adopt other biosecurity measures.",
      "\u201cOver the last five years, my small farm alone has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on biosecurity,\u201d said Minnesota turkey farmer Loren Brey. \u201cBut not only that, it's the time daily that you're attending to biosecurity.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has spent at least $1.14 billion compensating farmers for the birds they have had to kill. A similar number wasn't immediately available for how much has been spent to aid dairies.",
      "USDA spokeswoman Shilo Weir said the department also spent more than $576 million on its own response.",
      "The prices of turkey, milk and chicken have also seen some pressure from bird flu.",
      "Mike Vickers, a manager at Sentyrz Liquor & Supermarket in Minneapolis, said he can\u2019t even stock any organic, cage-free or brown eggs right now and is limited instead to selling large or jumbo eggs. He understands the pain customers are feeling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in my life that I\u2019ve ever had to be kind of embarrassed on what I'm selling eggs for,\" he said. \"And it\u2019s not our fault. We\u2019re paying today $7.45 for a dozen eggs. We\u2019re selling for $7.59. We\u2019re making $0.14. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d",

      "A frenzy over an artificial intelligence chatbot made by Chinese tech startup DeepSeek was upending stock markets Monday and fueling debates over the economic and geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China in developing AI technology.",
      "DeepSeek's AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple's iPhone store Monday, propelled by curiosity about the ChatGPT competitor. Part of what's worrying some U.S. tech industry observers is the idea that the Chinese startup has caught up with the American companies at the forefront of generative AI at a fraction of the cost.",
      "That, if true, calls into question the huge amounts of money U.S. tech companies say they plan to spend on the data centers and computer chips needed to power further AI advancements.",
      "But hype and misconceptions about DeepSeek's technological advancements also sowed confusion.",
      "\"The models they built are fantastic, but they aren't miracles either,\" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who follows the semiconductor industry and was one of several stock analysts describing Wall Street's reaction as overblown.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not using any innovations that are unknown or secret or anything like that,\" Rasgon said. \"These are things that everybody\u2019s experimenting with.\u201d",
      "The startup DeepSeek was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China and released its first AI large language model later that year. Its CEO Liang Wenfeng previously co-founded one of China's top hedge funds, High-Flyer, which focuses on AI-driven quantitative trading. The fund, by 2022, had amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia's high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "DeepSeek has said its recent models were built with Nvidia\u2019s lower-performing H800 chips, which are not banned in China, sending a message that the fanciest hardware might not be needed for cutting-edge AI research.",
      "DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "But it was a follow-up research paper published last week \u2014 on the same day as President Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 that set in motion the panic that followed. That paper was about another DeepSeek AI model called R1 that showed advanced \u201creasoning\u201d skills \u2014 such as the ability to rethink its approach to a math problem \u2014 and was significantly cheaper than a similar model sold by OpenAI called o1.",
      "\u201cWhat their economics look like, I have no idea,\u201d Rasgon said. \u201cBut I think the price points freaked people out.\u201d",
      "Behind the drama over DeepSeek's technical capabilities is a debate within the U.S. over how best to compete with China on AI.",
      "\u201cDeepseek R1 is AI\u2019s Sputnik moment,\u201d said venture capitalist Marc Andreessen in a Sunday post on social platform X, referencing the 1957 satellite launch that set off a Cold War space exploration race between the Soviet Union and the U.S.",
      "Andreessen, who has advised Trump on tech policy, has warned that overregulation of the AI industry by the U.S. government will hinder American companies and enable China to get ahead.",
      "But the attention on DeepSeek also threatens to undermine a key strategy of U.S. foreign policy in recent years to restrict the sale of American-designed AI semiconductors to China. Some experts on U.S.-China relations don't think that is an accident.",
      "\u201cThe technology innovation is real, but the timing of the release is political in nature,\u201d said Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Allen compared DeepSeek's announcement last week to U.S.-sanctioned Chinese company Huawei's release of a new phone during diplomatic discussions over Biden administration export controls in 2023.",
      "\u201cTrying to show that the export controls are futile or counterproductive is a really important goal of Chinese foreign policy right now,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Trump signed an order on his first day in office last week that said his administration would \u201cidentify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\u201d signaling that he is likely to continue and harden Biden's approach.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s stock dropped 17% Monday, but the company in a statement commended DeepSeek\u2019s work as \u201can excellent AI advancement\u201d that leveraged \u201cwidely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\u201d",
      "One thing that distinguishes DeepSeek from competitors such as OpenAI is that its models are \u201copen source\u201d \u2014 meaning key components are free for anyone to access and modify, though the company hasn\u2019t disclosed the data it used for training.",
      "But what's attracted the most admiration about DeepSeek's R1 model is what Nvidia calls a \"perfect example of Test Time Scaling\" \u2014 or when AI models effectively show their train of thought, and then use that for further training without having to feed them new sources of data.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just thinking out loud, basically,\u201d said Lennart Heim, a researcher at Rand Corp.",
      "OpenAI's reasoning models, starting with o1, do the same, and it's likely that other U.S.-based competitors such as Anthropic and Google have similar capabilities that haven't been released, Heim said.",
      "But \u201cit\u2019s the first time that we see a Chinese company being that close within a relatively short time period. I think that\u2019s why a lot of people pay attention to it,\u201d Heim said. \u201cI used to believe OpenAI was the leader, the king of the hill, and that nobody could catch up. Turns out this is not completely the case.\u201d"

      "MADRID -- Spain attracted a record 94 million tourists last year, making the Southern European nation famous for its Mediterranean coastline, sweeping landscapes and historic cities among the most visited countries on earth.",
      "The surge in visitors has stoked complaints at times from some Spaniards about \u201covertourism, \u201d with concerns about overcrowding, water use and particularly the availability and affordability of housing.",
      "Spain's government has started listening to demands for more regulation, particularly around housing in Spain's big cities, where rising home and rental prices have become a key concern for voters. Earlier this month, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez introduced a 12-part plan to tackle the housing crisis, with measures aimed at bringing stricter regulations to short-term rentals that mainly cater to tourists.",
      "But that doesn't mean Spain is putting the brakes on tourism, an industry that accounts for about 12% of its GDP.",
      "Here's what you should know before planning a visit:",
      "No, but some cities have started to regulate tourism rental properties.",
      "Malaga, an Andalusian port city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Spain, will prohibit new rental properties in 43 neighborhoods of the city where those rentals exceed 8% of the residential stock. The policy went into effect earlier this month and will be tested for three years.",
      "Meanwhile, Barcelona plans to close down all of its 10,000 apartments licensed as short-term rentals in the coming years to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents. The Mediterranean city known for its beaches, art and surrealist architecture announced last year that it would not renew any new tourism apartment licenses after they expire in 2028.",
      "Yes. Tourists can book hotel stays and short-term apartment-style rentals just about anywhere in Spain.",
      "Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists are seen as driving up rental costs for locals, too.",
      "Visitors renting a car in Spain or booking hotel stays will also have to file more paperwork thanks to a new law that requires hotel owners and car rental companies to send personal information to the government for national security reasons.",
      "Passport details, home addresses and payment information used by travelers above 14 are among the details that will be collected."

      "The sanctions target trade, finance, energy, technology, industry, transport and luxury goods. They include a ban on the import or transfer of seaborne crude oil and certain petroleum products from Russia to the EU. They will now remain in place at least until July 31.",
      "Some measures were introduced in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, but the list grew significantly after Moscow's full-fledged invasion of its neighbor almost three years ago.",
      "On Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n called on the EU to intervene in a gas dispute that his country has with Ukraine. He said Kyiv\u2019s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas into Central Europe had forced Hungary to turn to alternative routes, which raised energy prices.",
      "To satisfy Orb\u00e1n's demand, the European Commission attached a statement to Monday\u2019s sanctions rollover agreement, saying that it \u201cexpects all third countries to respect\u201d EU energy security, and warned that it could take action to protect critical infrastructure like oil and gas pipelines.",
      "\u201cHungary has received the guarantees it has requested concerning the energy security of our country,\u201d Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said in a statement. All 27 EU member countries must agree for the sanctions to be prolonged.",

      "Retired swingman Andre Iguodala will become just the seventh player to have his number retired by the Golden State Warriors in a ceremony next month",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Andre Iguodala moves around town in the Bay Area these days, he is regularly stopped by fans eager to praise him for how he carried himself while playing for the Golden State Warriors.",
      "For his grit and his drive. For doing all the little things many never saw.",
      "Some even share how his example influenced the way they raise their own kids \u2014 because that's how much he has meant to big-time basketball both on the court and off it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m used to getting stopped a lot but now it throws me off because I don\u2019t play basketball anymore,\u201d Iguodala said. \"You can see a good fan versus a bad fan from a mile away, and so I\u2019m able to see, OK, this is a decent human being, and this is a genuine interaction. I think the folks that I\u2019m running into in the Bay are of high value and morals, and so 99% are really good interactions.",
      "\u201cYou walk away feeling a little bit better about yourself, actually, because you realize it\u2019s bigger than you.\u201d",
      "Now, Iguodala will give them more to celebrate and cheer about.",
      "The Warriors announced Tuesday that Iguodala is becoming the seventh player to have his number retired by the franchise \u2014 set to join Rick Barry (24), Wilt Chamberlain (13), Nate Thurmond (42), Al Attles (16), Chris Mullin (17) and Tom Meschery (14).",
      "Golden State will honor Iguodala and hang his No. 9 jersey following an afternoon game against Dallas on Feb. 23, meaning former teammate Klay Thompson will have the chance to be there.",
      "\u201cAndre will go down as one of the smartest, shrewdest and most unique and successful players ever to wear a Warriors uniform,\u201d owner Joe Lacob said.",
      "Iguodala retired in October 2023 after 19 NBA seasons and four championships with Golden State, including an NBA Finals MVP award in 2015. Shortly after announcing he was done playing, Iguodala became the acting executive director of the National Basketball Players Association.",
      "The 40-year-old Iguodala was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft out of Arizona and played in 1,231 career games. He spent eight seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, one in Denver, six with the Warriors, two in Miami and the last two back for Golden State. He was part of NBA champions in 2015, \u201817, \u201918 and 2022.",
      "A defensive stopper who took on a variety of roles, Iguodala not only mentored teammates at the end of his career but also provided insight to coach Steve Kerr.",
      "It was Kerr who trusted Iguodala to perform on the big stage that the coach moved him into the starting lineup trailing 2-1 to the Cavaliers in the 2015 Finals and gave him the assignment of guarding then-Cleveland star LeBron James.",
      "\u201cA lot of those things go unnoticed,\" the retired swingman said. \u201cI constantly get stopped by folks and they say, 'You know, you really helped me raise my children in terms of bringing a proper approach, to whatever it is that you do, respecting what you do, doing it at a high level, teamwork, discipline. Sacrifice is probably the biggest thing that they use in regards to me, with sometimes less is more, but knowing when to be ready for the big moments.\u201d",

There isn't a single first-year player on pace to average 15 points and appear in enough games to qualify for the league's leaderboard; the last time that happened was 2016-17.

      "\u201cHe really has a chance to be special,\u201d Paul said of Castle, his Spurs teammate.",

      "As soon as this year's Super Bowl matchup was set, workers at the Wilson Sporting Goods football factory jumped into action.",

      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "\u201cWe carry this on for him,\u201d said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA's Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. \u201cHe would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of \u2019Phe and Stewie. I know that he\u2019s looking down and hopefully he\u2019s smiling and is proud of us.\u201d",
      "Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant.",
      "\u201cI think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,\u201d Sabally added. \u201cHe was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.\"",
      "The shock of the superstar's death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief.",
      "People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day.",
      "\u201cI still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,\" said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, \"and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.\u201d",
      "Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality \u2014 he had a relentless competitiveness \u2014 and the way he elevated women's sports.",
      "Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters' hoops journeys and coached Gianna's youth team. He was often at women's basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant's legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next.",
      "Bryant was passionate about women's sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women\u2019s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort.",
      "Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court.",
      "There's an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,\" said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled's Vinyl BC. \"And his daughter was right there as well.\u201d",
      "That's who Bryant had become \u2014 a face of women's sports advocacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s greatly missed,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut now his legacy will live on forever.\u201d",

      "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alexander Zverev described himself as \u201cquite down\u201d and \u201cquite emotional\" after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title.",
      "And unlike his first two defeats in major finals \u2014 both of which he led, and both of which went five sets \u2014 Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending champion Jannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can. I\u2019m working as hard as I ever did. I think I\u2019m doing all the right things off-court. I think I\u2019m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,\u201d said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion.",
      "\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Zverev, whose post-match speech was interrupted by someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who have accused him of physical abuse in the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing everything I can,\" Zverev said, \"to lift one of those trophies.\u201d",
      "He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport's four most important events.",
      "Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn't is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active.",
      "Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder \u2014 and with his words.",
      "\u201cKeep believing in yourself,\u201d Sinner told Zverev. \u201cKeep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.\u201d",
      "Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner\u2019s coaches, said about Zverev: \u201cI really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.\u201d",
      "Zverev's previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the 2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away.",
      "This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets",
      "The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that.",
      "\u201cThat was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It\u2019s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cIf it\u2019s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn\u2019t stop fighting. I didn\u2019t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.\u201d",

      "The Swiss skier then had a slow start to the new campaign after missing the season-opening race in October. However, the defending overall champion then racked up three second places in Super-G before winning Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's been a weird start of the season, obviously I was struggling a little bit,\u201d Gut-Behrami said. \u201cI had to find the confidence back, the way to push in the skis again.\u201d",
      "Gut-Behrami has now won at least one World Cup race in 11 of the past 12 seasons, with 2018-19 the only exception.",
      "The start of Sunday's race was delayed for 15 minutes as organizers needed more time to prepare the course after overnight snowfall and rain in the hours leading up to the race.",
      "Ariane Raedler had a nasty tumble when she came off the course and lost balance over a patch of softer snow, but the Austrian got up quickly and appeared to have avoided injury.",

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 14:34:29 -0500",
    "summary": "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
    "story": [
      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",

      "President Donald Trump says Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April",
      "President Donald Trump said Monday evening that Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April.",
      "\u201cI would say yes,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked if Microsoft was one of the companies interested in helping to bring about a new ownership of TikTok, a requirement set by Congress to keep the app functioning in the U.S.",
      "Trump added that other companies were also interested in purchasing TikTok, but wouldn\u2019t provide a list.",
      "\u201cI like bidding wars because you make your best deals,\u201d Trump said as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back to Washington from Miami, where Republican House members were holding a conference.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one of his first acts in office last week, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find new ownership that satisfies the government by 75 days, to April 4 from January 19.",
      "The president has said that he\u2019s looking for the ultimate purchaser to give the U.S. a 50% stake in the company, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. But the details remain murky, and its unclear whether he's proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.",
      "Last week, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Several other investors \u2014 including billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have spoken publicly about their desire to purchase TikTok's U.S. platform. Trump has also said he\u2019s spoken to \u201cmany people\u201d privately about the company.",
      "After the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.",
      "Lawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Trump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.",
      "Microsoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d"

      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania have voted to unionize, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain",
      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\u201cThis fight is far from over, but today\u2019s victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers\u2019 needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon\u2019s grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \u201cis proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\u201d the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \u201con-demand\u201d mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vaccines are not safe. His support for abortion access has made conservatives uncomfortable. And farmers across the Midwest are nervous over his talk of banning corn syrup and pesticides from America's food supply.",
      "The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches building his own quixotic brand.",
      "A son of a Democratic political dynasty, Kennedy is seeking to become the nation's top health official under President Donald Trump. To get there, he's softening those long-held beliefs, hoping to win approval from the Republican Party.",
      "At stake is Kennedy's control of the nation's sprawling $1.7 trillion U.S. Health and Human Services agency, which oversees food and hospital inspections, health insurance for roughly half of the country and vaccine recommendations. The job would finally give him the kind of political power Kennedys have wielded for decades.",
      "He made a long-shot bid for the presidency last year, following uncles John, who won the White House in 1960, and Edward, who lost his bid in 1980, along with his father, Robert, a leading contender who was assassinated after winning the California primary in 1968.",
      "With a strong resemblance to his father and lawyer credentials to match, he found ardent followers who embrace the critiques he's lodged against unhealthy foods, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals.",
      "But he couldn't get Democrats on his side, with some of his relatives shunning him over his vaccine views. His has been a flexible ideological journey, part liberal Democrat, part libertarian, and now, an adherent of the MAGA agenda after dropping out of the race last year to back Trump.",
      "The president has since directed him to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health. Together, they've even hatched a new slogan: \"Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's aspirations now rest with the Republican-controlled Senate, where he can lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.",
      "As Kennedy's confirmation hearings approach this week, he faces a coordinated effort to stop his nomination. A television and digital ad campaign is highlighting his anti-vaccine work. And former Vice President Mike Pence, a stalwart of the conservative anti-abortion movement, is lobbying against him, too.",
      "Kennedy's closest supporters believe he'll prevail. He plans to focus on issues that have bipartisan consensus, like reducing food additives and increasing access to healthier foods. When concerns about his views on conservative priorities like abortion come up, he's promised to follow Trump's lead.",
      "Then there is Kennedy's biggest advantage \u2014 and maybe, too, his biggest liability for someone working under Trump \u2014 his star power.",
      "\u201cBobby K. is coming in with a bigger microphone than any HHS Secretary,\u201d said Calley Means, a close adviser to Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him.",
      "He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \u201cmedical freedom\u201d who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \u201ctake away\u201d vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children\u2019s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including the government authorizations of some of them.",
      "But critics have argued that his work advocating against vaccine use has cost lives. Democrats are poised to home in on his social media campaigns and work in Samoa, the island nation in the Pacific Ocean where doctors say he and his anti-vaccine acolytes seized on a tragedy to campaign against childhood inoculations.",
      "In 2018, two Samoan children died from botched vaccinations, prompting the government to suspend the childhood vaccination program.",
      "Kennedy showed up with his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, to meet with the prime minister, health minister and other health officials in 2019. Kennedy says he promoted a \u201cmedical informatics system\u201d that would \"assess the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health.\u201d",
      "Later that year, a measles epidemic killed dozens of infants and children.",
      "Democrat Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, an emergency room doctor who organized flights loaded with 50,000 vaccine doses, doctors and nurses to administer inoculations, has led the campaign to highlight Kennedy's role. He shared during one-on-one meetings with a handful of senators earlier this month what he witnessed there, including accounts from villagers who told them about Facebook posts that scared them away from vaccinations.",
      "\u201cHe went there and used celebrity status to scare the country away from vaccinating,\" Green said of Kennedy. \"You have to ask yourself, \u2018Why, RFK Jr., would you go to Samoa and do this to innocent people?\u2019\u201d",
      "Kennedy has denied playing any role in the outbreak.",
      "A Democratic group is running digital ads that accuse Kennedy of spreading misinformation in Samoa. The campaign is targeting senators in nine states, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah, which boasts a significant Samoan population.",
      "Another they're targeting is Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Senate committee, which holds a hearing Thursday. Cassidy, who is also a doctor, stopped short of endorsing Kennedy after they met and is seen as swayable.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who suffered from polio as a child, may also be in play. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, McConnell dipped into his own campaign funds to urge Kentucky residents to vaccinate against the virus.",
      "Last month, McConnell sent a warning about attempts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "Other conservatives have question Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks.",
      "In meetings with some senators, he's promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate.",
      "But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. has made certain overtures to pro-life leaders that he would be mindful of their concerns at HHS, there is little reason for confidence at this time,\" his group said in a letter sent to senators last week.",
      "In Iowa, Kennedy's nomination both excites and worries corn and soybean farmer Brian Fyre.",
      "The sixth-generation farmer and Republican thinks Kennedy will offer a fresh perspective, but he also can't afford the ban on corn syrup or pesticides that Kennedy has promised. If confirmed, Kennedy would oversee the Food and Drug Administration, which has the power to enact restrictions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be pinched out. It would devastate rural, Midwest communities,\u201d Fyre said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a food supply for a nation. You can\u2019t upend that without a viable alternative.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said he planned to offer some \u201ceducating\u201d on agriculture to Kennedy.",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from a dairy farm state, sees it differently, telling a crowd at the Heritage Foundation last month that Kennedy's agriculture ideas are a promising part of a bigger goal: \u201cto Make America Healthy Again.\u201d"

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- After a half-century of public silence, a freelance photographer from Vietnam has asserted he took one of the most renowned and impactful photos of the 20th century \u2014 the image of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack in South Vietnam that has long been credited to a staff photographer from The Associated Press.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Nghe claimed authorship of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and on the sidelines of its premiere Saturday night at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.",
      "The AP conducted its own investigation and said it has no reason to conclude that anyone other than the long-credited photographer, Nick Ut, made the picture. The news agency said it was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that filmmakers portrayed it as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive. The AP said it saw the film for the first time at Sundance.",
      "Nghe joined the filmmakers for the post-screening Q&A where he said, through a translator, \u201cI took the photo.\u201d The audience cheered enthusiastically. He did not say why he waited so long to make the claim.",
      "The AP said it was calling on the filmmakers to release their contributors from non-disclosure agreements for the film, including Nghe. It also called on the filmmakers to share a visual analysis they commissioned \u2014 and the film itself. \u201cWe cannot state more clearly that The Associated Press is only interested in the facts and a truthful history of this iconic photo,\" the agency said.",
      "Nguyen says he took the iconic photo of Kim Phuc on June 8, 1972. Nghe said he went to the town of Trang Bang that day as a driver for an NBC news crew and captured the image of Phuc running down the street, crying and naked with arms outstretched. He said he sold his image to the AP for $20, and they gave him a print of the photo that his wife later destroyed.",
      "Representatives for the AP, who saw the film for the first time Saturday at the premiere, are contesting the film's implication that the company reviewed their findings and dismissed them.",
      "\u201cAs recently as December, we reiterated our request to see the filmmakers\u2019 full materials and they did not respond, nor did they include AP\u2019s full response in the film,\" Lauren Easton, an AP spokesperson, said Sunday. \"We were surprised and disappointed that the film portrayed AP as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive of the allegations, which is completely false.\"",
      "The film\u2019s investigation was led by husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner. Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese American filmmaker, directed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI had a healthy skepticism, as I think anyone would, going against a 53-year-old truth. ... But as a storyteller and a filmmaker, I thought it was my both or my responsibility and my privilege to be able to uplift the story of individuals like Nghe.\u201d",
      "Before having seen the film, the AP conducted its own investigation over six months and concluded it had \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d Now, the AP is calling on the filmmakers to lift the non-disclosure agreements they placed on their subjects to allow the company to investigate more fully.",
      "\u201cAP stands ready to review any and all evidence and new information about this photo,\" Easton said.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP would not. The film suggests that evidence was presented to the AP, which the AP says is not true.",
      "A primary source in the film is Carl Robinson, then an AP photo editor in Saigon, who was overruled in his judgment not to use the picture by Horst Faas, AP's Saigon chief of photos. Robinson says in the film that Faas instructed him to \u201cmake it staff\u201d and credit Ut for the photo. Both Faas and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed the film, are dead. Robinson, 81, was dismissed by the AP in 1978.",
      "On Saturday, a Sundance Institute moderator asked why he wanted to come forward with the allegations now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die before this story came out,\u201d Robinson told the audience after the screening. \u201cI wanted to find (Nghe) and say sorry.\u201d",
      "A variety of witnesses interviewed by AP, including renowned correspondents such as Fox Butterfield and Peter Arnett and the photo\u2019s subject herself, Phuc, say they are certain Ut took the photo.",
      "Robinson was one such person the AP attempted to speak to during their investigation but \u201cwere told we could only do so under conditions\" that they said would have prevented them from \u201ctaking swift action if necessary.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s investigation took over two years. The journalists enlisted a French forensics team, INDEX, to help determine the likelihood of whether Ut had been in a position to take the photo. The forensics team concluded that it was highly unlikely that Ut could have done it.",
      "Ut's attorney, James Hornstein, had this to say Sunday after the premiere: \u201cIn due course, we will proceed to right this wrong in a courtroom where Nick Ut\u2019s reputation will be vindicated.\u201d",
      "Knight referenced AP\u2019s investigation Saturday, telling the audience that the company's statement is available online. \u201cThey said they\u2019re open always to examining the truth. And I think it was a very reasonable thing to say,\u201d Knight said. \u201cOur story is here and it\u2019s here for you all to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThings happen in the field in the heat of the moment. ... We\u2019re all stronger if we examine ourselves, ask tough questions, and we\u2019re open and honest about what goes on in our profession. Now more than ever, I would argue.\"",

      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory",
      "WASHINGTON -- The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \u201clow confidence\u201d in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cCIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario.",
      "\u201cThe lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\u201d Ratcliffe said in 2023.",
      "The CIA \u201cwill continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA\u2019s assessment,\u201d the agency spokesperson said."

      "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research \u2014 known to locals as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d",
      "The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details.",
      "While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters).",
      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",
      "Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" \u2014 a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques.",
      "The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The compound is about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia."

      "Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals that would let them plug directly into power plants",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.",
      "It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly.",
      "Front and center is the data center that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania.",
      "The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 is the first such to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts \u2014 about 40% of the plant's capacity \u2014 to the data center. That's enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural ground, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things.",
      "\u201cThe companies, they\u2019re very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that\u2019s really big,\u201d said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re delayed five years in the queue, for example \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it would be five years, but years anyway \u2014 they might completely miss the business opportunity.\u201d",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste.",
      "Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, like coal, oil or gas-fueled plants.",
      "Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels.",
      "They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said.",
      "Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines.",
      "In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna\u2019s majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power.",
      "The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators, in particular, are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they have been forced to compete in some markets against a flood of cheap natural gas as well as state-subsidized solar and wind energy.",
      "Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else.",
      "A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say.",
      "FERC\u2019s 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study.",
      "In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal.",
      "Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be \u201cextreme\u201d if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory.",
      "Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said.",
      "Separately, two electric utility owners \u2014 which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power \u2014 have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe.",
      "Susquehanna\u2019s owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services, and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others.",
      "FERC's decision will have \u201cmassive repercussions for the entire country\u201d because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly.",
      "\u201cThe timing of this issue is before us,\" she said, \u201cand if we take our typical five years to get this perfect, it will be too late.\u201d",

      "\u201cI went from light to darkness in a fraction of a second,\u201d Mistre said, describing the day in September 2021 that marked the start of her fight against TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app she blames for pushing her daughter toward despair.",

      "\u201cIt was brainwashing,\u201d said Mistre, who lives in Cassis, near Marseille, in the south of France. \u201cThey normalized depression and self-harm, turning it into a twisted sense of belonging.\u201d",
      "Now Mistre and six other families are suing TikTok France, accusing the platform of failing to moderate harmful content and exposing children to life-threatening material. Out of the seven families, two experienced the loss of a child.",
      "Asked about the lawsuit, TikTok said its guidelines forbid any promotion of suicide and that it employs 40,000 trust and safety professionals worldwide \u2014 hundreds of which are French-speaking moderators \u2014 to remove dangerous posts. The company also said it refers users who search for suicide-related videos to mental health services.",
      "Before killing herself, Marie Le Tiec made several videos to explain her decision, citing various difficulties in her life, and quoted a song by the Louisiana-based emo rap group Suicideboys, who are popular on TikTok.",
      "Her mother also claims that her daughter was repeatedly bullied and harassed at school and online. In addition to the lawsuit, the 51-year-old mother and her husband have filed a complaint against five of Marie\u2019s classmates and her previous high school.",
      "Above all, Mistre blames TikTok, saying that putting the app \"in the hands of an empathetic and sensitive teenager who does not know what is real from what is not is like a ticking bomb.\u201d",
      "Scientists have not established a clear link between social media and mental health problems or psychological harm, said Gr\u00e9goire Borst, a professor of psychology and cognitive neuroscience at Paris-Cit\u00e9 University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to show clear cause and effect in this area,\u201d Borst said, citing a leading peer-reviewed study that found only 0.4% of the differences in teenagers\u2019 well-being could be attributed to social media use.",
      "Additionally, Borst pointed out that no current studies suggest TikTok is any more harmful than rival apps such as Snapchat, X, Facebook or Instagram.",
      "While most teens use social media without significant harm, the real risks, Borst said, lie with those already facing challenges such as bullying or family instability.",
      "\u201cWhen teenagers already feel bad about themselves and spend time exposed to distorted images or harmful social comparisons,\" it can worsen their mental state, Borst said.",
      "Lawyer Laure Boutron-Marmion, who represents the seven families suing TikTok, said their case is based on \u201cextensive evidence.\u201d The company \"can no longer hide behind the claim that it\u2019s not their responsibility because they don\u2019t create the content,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that TikTok\u2019s algorithm is designed to trap vulnerable users in cycles of despair for profit and seeks reparations for the families.",
      "\u201cTheir strategy is insidious,\u201d Mistre said. \u201cThey hook children into depressive content to keep them on the platform, turning them into lucrative re-engagement products.\u201d",
      "Boutron-Marmion noted that TikTok\u2019s Chinese version, Douyin, features much stricter content controls for young users. It includes a \u201cyouth mode\u201d mandatory for users under 14 that restricts screen time to 40 minutes a day and offers only approved content.",
      "\u201cIt proves they can moderate content when they choose to,\u201d Boutron-Marmion said. \u201cThe absence of these safeguards here is telling.\u201d",
      "A report titled \u201cChildren and Screens,\u201d commissioned by French President Emmanuel Macron in April and to which Borst contributed, concluded that certain algorithmic features should be considered addictive and banned from any app in France. The report also called for restricting social media access for minors under 15 in France. Neither measure has been adopted.",
      "TikTok, which faced being shut down in the U.S. until President Donald Trump suspended a ban on it, has also come under scrutiny globally.",
      "The U.S. has seen similar legal efforts by parents. One lawsuit in Los Angeles County accuses Meta and its platforms Instagram and Facebook, as well as Snapchat and TikTok, of designing defective products that cause serious injuries. The lawsuit lists three teens who died by suicide. In another complaint, two tribal nations accuse major social media companies, including YouTube owner Alphabet, of contributing to high rates of suicide among Native youths.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents who had lost children while testifying last year in the U.S. Senate.",
      "In December, Australia enacted a groundbreaking law banning social media accounts for children under 16.",
      "In France, Boutron-Marmion expects TikTok Limited Technologies, the European Union subsidiary for ByteDance \u2014 the Chinese company that owns TikTok \u2014 to answer the allegations in the first quarter of 2025. Authorities will later decide whether and when a trial would take place.",
      "When contacted by The Associated Press, TikTok said it had not been notified about the French lawsuit, which was filed in November. It could take months for the French justice system to process the complaint and for authorities in Ireland \u2014 home to TikTok\u2019s European headquarters \u2014 to formally notify the company, Boutron-Marmion said.",
      "Instead, a Tiktok spokesperson highlighted company guidelines that prohibit content promoting suicide or self-harm.",
      "Critics argue that TikTok\u2019s claims of robust moderation fall short.",
      "Imran Ahmed, the CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, dismissed TikTok\u2019s assertion that over 98.8% of harmful videos had been flagged and removed between April and June.",
      "When asked about the blind spots of their moderation efforts, social media platforms claim that users are able to bypass detection by using ambiguous language or allusions that algorithms struggle to flag, Ahmed said.",
      "The term \u201calgospeak\u201d has been coined to describe techniques such as using zebra or armadillo emojis to talk about cutting yourself, or the Swiss flag emoji as an allusion to suicide.",
      "Such code words \"aren\u2019t particularly sophisticated,\u201d Ahmed said. \"The only reason TikTok can\u2019t find them when independent researchers, journalists and others can is because they\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d Ahmed said.",

      "Elon Musk is clashing with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the Stargate artificial intelligence infrastructure project touted by President Donald Trump, the latest in a feud between the two tech billionaires that started on OpenAI's board and is now testing Musk's influence with the new president.",
      "Trump on Tuesday had talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion through a new partnership formed by OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, alongside Oracle and SoftBank.",
      "The new entity, Stargate, is already starting to build out data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of fast-evolving AI technology.",
      "Trump declared it \u201ca resounding declaration of confidence in America\u2019s potential\u201d under his new administration, with an initial private investment of $100 billion that could reach five times that sum.",
      "But Musk, a close Trump adviser who helped bankroll his campaign and now leads a government cost-cutting initiative, questioned the value of the investment hours later.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t actually have the money,\u201d Musk wrote on his social platform X. \u201cSoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.\u201d",
      "Altman responded Wednesday to say Musk was \u201cwrong, as you surely know\u201d and inviting Musk to come visit the first site in Texas that is already under construction.",
      "\"(T)his is great for the country. i realize what is great for the country isn\u2019t always what\u2019s optimal for your companies, but in your new role i hope you\u2019ll mostly put (America) first,\u201d Altman wrote, using a U.S. flag emoji to represent America.",
      "The public clash over Stargate is part of a years-long dispute between Musk and Altman that began with a boardroom rivalry over who should run OpenAI, which both men helped found.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. A hearing is set for February in a California federal court.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI, that is building its own big data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "Tech news outlet The Information first reported on an OpenAI data center project called Stargate in March 2024, indicating that it's been in the works long before Trump announced it.",
      "Another company \u2014 Crusoe Energy Systems \u2014 announced in July it was building a large and \u201cspecially designed AI data center\u201d at the northwest edge of Abilene, Texas at a site run by energy technology company Lancium. Crusoe and Lancium said in a joint statement at the time that the project was \u201csupported by a multibillion-dollar investment\u201d but didn't disclose its backers.",
      "AI technology requires huge amounts of electricity to build and operate and both companies said the project would be powered with renewable sources such as nearby solar farms, in a way that Lancium CEO Michael McNamara said would \u201cdeliver the maximum amount of green energy at the lowest possible cost.\u201d Crusoe said it would own and develop the facility.",
      "It's not clear how and when that project became the first phase of the Stargate investment revealed by Trump. Abilene Mayor Weldon Hurt said construction began about nine months ago but \u201cwe didn\u2019t know it was going to be quite this big. We thought it was going to be about a third of this size.\u201d",
      "Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said Tuesday that the Abilene project is the first of about 10 data center buildings currently being built and that number could expand to 20.",
      "Hurt told The Associated Press that the region surrounding Abilene, a city of about 130,000 people, benefits from a wealth of energy sources, including oil, gas, solar and some of the \u201clargest wind farms in the world,\u201d though Trump signaled opposition to wind power this week by temporarily halting approval of wind projects on federal lands.",
      "\u201cWe have the capability to produce the energy for this market so it really means a lot for a town like Abilene,\u201d Hurt said. \u201cTo have this opportunity here in west-central Texas, to have something like this to make Abilene substantial, we\u2019re just excited about it.\u201d",
      "Missing from Trump's press conference Tuesday was Microsoft, which has long supported OpenAI with billions of dollars in investments and enabling its data centers to be used to build the models behind ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.",
      "Microsoft is also a technology partner in the Stargate project, along with chipmakers Nvidia and Arm, but put out a statement noting that its OpenAI partnership will \u201cevolve\u201d in a way that enables OpenAI \u201cto build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d",
      "Asked about Musk's comments about the Stargate deal Wednesday during a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pivoted to his company's own $80 billion plan to build out its global AI infrastructure, of which $50 billion is being spent in the U.S.",
      "\u201cLook, all I know is, I\u2019m good for my $80 billion,\u201d said Nadella, laughing."

    "story": [
      "Sources say Vice President JD Vance has been calling senators on his behalf.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of the nation's most publicly recognized vaccine skeptics, is expected to face sharp questions Wednesday when he goes before a Senate panel for the first time as President Donald Trump's pick to become health secretary.",
      "A longtime environmental lawyer with no experience working in public health administration or medicine, Kennedy is known for his work in questioning the safety and efficacy of vaccines, including encouraging parents not to adhere to vaccination recommendations and helping to sue a vaccine manufacturer for what he alleged was marketing fraud.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would be in charge of overseeing a vast federal agency that manages the health care of some 170 million Americans, regulates access to drugs and vaccines and tracks urgent outbreaks of diseases and foodborne illnesses.",
      "According to two people familiar with the matter, Vice President JD Vance has been lobbying senators behind closed doors to support Kennedy. A spokesperson for Vance did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Vance is working the phones to make sure Bobby gets over the line,\" one person said.",
      "In private meetings with senators, Kennedy has been telling senators that he's not \"anti-vaccine,\" but rather that he wants more study, according to two people familiar with the discussions. That message appears to be working with several Republicans who say they are satisfied with his approach so far.",
      "\"I don't agree with everything that he says but we certainly both think that there are opportunities in nutrition and to decrease the toxins that kids are exposed to,\" said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan.",
      "Kennedy can only afford to lose three Republican votes on the Senate floor and still get confirmed. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor, has panned Kennedy's position on vaccines. Other Republicans have said they want Kennedy -- a Democrat before aligning with Trump -- to clarify his position on abortion rights.",
      "So far, no Democrats have pledged to back him with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling her private meeting with Kennedy \"by far the strangest\" meeting she's had with a potential cabinet secretary.",
      "\"I was appalled at his answers and his lack of knowledge and what he was pushing on the American people,\" she said. \"We need somebody in charge of this agency that is going to make sure that our kids and grandkids ... have the correct health care information not misinformation.\"",
      "Kennedy has been preparing for this week's hearings by holding what insiders call \"murder board sessions\"\u2013 intense rounds of question-and-answer led by a group of advisors to prepare Kennedy for the most difficult questions he might face in the hearing rooms.",
      "Lawyer Ken Nahagian, who escorted the nominee through the Senate hallways for meetings in recent weeks, led the sessions, according to two people with knowledge of his involvement.",
      "Kennedy's testimony comes as a scathing letter from his cousin and former U.S. ambassador, Caroline Kennedy, landed in the inboxes of senators calling him a \"predator\" who \"preys on the desperation of parents of sick children\" and is \"addicted to attention and power.\" Caroline Kennedy was the U.S. ambassador to Japan and later Australia during the Obama and Biden administrations.",
      "\"The American health care system, for all its flaws, is the envy of the world,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote. \"Its doctors and nurses, researchers, scientists, and caregivers are the most dedicated people I know \u2026 They deserve better than Bobby Kennedy \u2013 and so do the rest of us. I urge the Senate to reject his nomination.\"",
      "Outside groups critical of Kennedy said they were working to ensure senators understood the risks involved.",
      "\"RFK Jr. is so far out of the bounds of any kind of nomination for a post like this in my lifetime that there's no question you could ask or no answer he could give that would make him qualified for this, or not dangerous in the post,\" said Gregg Gonsalves, associate professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health.",
      "Gonsalves has been part of a letter-writing and phone campaign generating over 3,500 individual letters to senators from public health professionals, healthcare workers, community-based providers and scientists, asking the senators to reject Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Kennedy's hearing comes at a time when much of the public has grown skeptical of the government, public health and the media, while gravitating toward online influencers.",
      "The decline in public trust of health agencies in particular began during the COVID pandemic. Now, Americans are mostly split on saying whether they trust the Food and Drug Administration, according to a KFF poll released this week.",
      "At the same time, 80% of Republicans say they trust Trump and Kennedy as they would their own doctors, the poll found.",

    "story": [
      "The order seeks to restrict gender-affirming care for people under the age 19.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday seeking to restrict gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The order would move to restrict medical institutions that receive federal funding from providing such care -- including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and surgeries -- calling on the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" The executive order does not appear to restrict these procedures for non-transgender people under 19.",
      "It's the latest action from Trump that impacts the transgender community -- which is estimated to make up less than 1% of the population over the age of 13. Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, ending federal legal recognition of transgender people, and restricting gender marker changes on federal documents.",
      "Major national medical associations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and more than 20 others argue that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, beneficial, and medically necessary.",
      "Amid an increase in states moving to ban gender-affirming youth care, the American Psychological Association said in February it opposes state bans, \"which are contrary to the principles of evidence-based healthcare, human rights, and social justice, and which should be reconsidered in favor of policies that prioritize the well-being and autonomy of transgender, gender-diverse, and nonbinary individuals.\"",
      "Trump's executive order states that \"it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"",
      "The order also moves to exclude transgender-related coverage for young people from federal health insurance policies, including the Department of Defense's TRICARE benefits, the Federal Employee Health Benefits and the Postal Service Health Benefits.",
      "Trump's order expressed concerns that gender-affirming care sterilizes children, saying: \"countless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding.\"",
      "Medical experts previously told ABC News that they have not yet seen widespread, long-term fertility issues in puberty-aged youth who temporarily use puberty blockers while undergoing puberty and that hormone therapy does not necessarily make transgender people permanently sterilized, but that it does affect fertility. National guidelines state that physicians should thoroughly warn patients about the potential for reduced fertility before administering hormone therapy.",
      "Gender-affirming surgeries for transgender youth older than 12 are extremely rare, and those that are performed are almost entirely chest-related procedures, according to research in JAMA Network.",
      "A separate study by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health additionally found little to no usage of gender-affirming surgeries by transgender and gender-diverse minors in the U.S., instead finding that cisgender minors and adults had substantially higher utilization of such gender-affirming surgeries -- such as breast-reduction surgeries for cisgender boys and young men -- than their transgender counterparts.",

None of them are vaccinated. I watched a daughter collapse on the floor while we pronounced her mother\u2019s time of death. I held the hand of a man who was about to get intubated. He looked at me with tears in his eyes, asking me to please save him. He will likely die in the coming days.\u201d",

I don\u2019t dismiss your experience but it differs with data we are seeing from Israel, UK and other nations with much more reliable data systems.

    "story": [
      "President Trump claimed ownership of Greenland is an \"absolute necessity.\"",
      "As President Donald Trump makes a very public effort to acquire Greenland, one former Danish official said Trump's attempts are nothing new -- but he shouldn't expect it to be easy. Interest in buying Greenland has \"popped up from time to time in American politics,\" Tom H\u00f8yem, Denmark's minister to Greenland from 1982 to 1987, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "H\u00f8yem, 83, discussed Greenland's political importance over the years, as well as his reaction to Trump's recent desire to buy the island territory.",
      "\"Trump is living in a narrative where this has been an issue for the last 150 years,\" H\u00f8yem said.",
      "The purchase of Greenland has been a topic of conversation since before World War II, when Denmark sold the Danish West Indies -- now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands -- to the United States in 1917 for $25 million, H\u00f8yem said. Many American policymakers argued the U.S. should also acquire Greenland as well, according to H\u00f8yem.",
      "\"[President] Woodrow Wilson at first said, 'No, it's not worth anything at all. It's just ice. I don't want it.' But there was such a big debate in the U.S. that he was forced to do something,\" H\u00f8yem said.",
      "When Wilson asked for ownership of Greenland, the Danish minister at the time replied, \"No,\" according to H\u00f8yem. Wilson signed an agreement in 1917 stating the United States recognizes Greenland as Danish, H\u00f8yem said.",
      "In the document discussing the transfer of the Danish West Indies, then-Secretary of State Robert Lansing wrote, \"In preceding this day to the signature of the Convention respecting the cessation of the Danish West-Indian Island to the United States of America, the undersigned Secretary of State of the United States of America, duly authorized by his Government, has the honor to declare that the Government of the United States of America will not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland.\"",
      "If Denmark was to ever sell Greenland to any country, H\u00f8yem said the United Kingdom would receive the first right to buy it, since the U.K. held dominion over Canada at the time of the treaty.",
      "\"Canada is only 20 kilometers away. That's why the British said, 'If Denmark ever sells Greenland, we should be the first to decide whether to take it or not,'\" H\u00f8yem told ABC News.",
      "Now, with Trump saying he wants to purchase Greenland, H\u00f8yem said history is repeating itself.",
      "\"Trump grew up hearing these stories,\" H\u00f8yem said. \"His generation and his parents' generation often heard about U.S. attempts to buy Greenland.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in acquiring the island territory, beginning during his first administration when he tried to buy Greenland, but instead gave $12 million for economic development. Trump has since restated his interest in buying the territory shortly before his second inauguration.",
      "\"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,\" Trump said in a December 2024 statement.",
      "Trump said the purchase was needed for security purposes, adding he is \"protecting the free world.\" The U.S. also operates Putiffik Space Base, the Defense Department's northern-most base, which sits on the coast of Greenland. The U.S. does not pay Greenland for operating the base in the country, H\u00f8yem said, as part of a NATO agreement signed in 1951.",
      "\"You have approximately 45,000 people there. People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it,\" Trump said, without explanation, during a Jan. 7 press conference at Mar-a-Lago. \"But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world.\"",
      "Greenland is also rich in valuable minerals, including rare earth metals, precious metals, precious stones, and uranium, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Association. While that may sound appealing to a potential buyer, H\u00f8yem said mining there is extremely expensive.",
      "Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., visited Greenland on Jan. 7, but stated the visit was for personal reasons. During this trip, his father said on social media, \"Don. Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland. The reception has been great. They, and the Free World, need safety, security, strength and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also reiterated an interest in the U.S. securing Greenland during his Senate confirmation hearings.",
      "\"Putting aside all the things that are going on in the media, I think we need to understand that Greenland's been strategically important to the United States and to the West for a very long time,\" Rubio said. \"I think we now have the opportunity to see it for what it is, and that is one, if not the most important, one of the most critical parts of the world over the next 50 to 100 years will be whether there's going to be freedom of navigation in the Arctic and what that will mean for global trade and commerce.\"",
      "H\u00f8yem said he does not know Trump, but thinks \"he needs to be briefed a bit more by his civil servants.\"",
      "\"His new minister of foreign affairs spoke to the Danish foreign minister -- my party leader and friend -- and they both agreed: 'Let's not discuss Greenland for now,'\" H\u00f8yem said.",
      "The prime minister of Greenland, M\u00fate Egsede, has rejected the idea of selling Greenland to Trump, saying, \"Greenland is ours.\"",
      "\"We are not for sale and will never be for sale,\" Egsede said in a statement. \"We must not lose our long struggle for freedom.\"",
      "Officials from Denmark also have not supported Trump's Greenmark proposal, including Danish politician Anders Vistisen, who explicitly urged the newly elected president to \"f--- off.\"",
      "\"Greenland has been part of the Danish kingdom for 800 years,\" Vistisen said during a European Parliament meeting on Jan. 21 in Strasbourg, France. \"It's an integrated part of our country. It is not for sale.\"",
      "H\u00f8yem said if Greenland decided to become independent, \"they would immediately be targeted by major global powers.\" Until then, H\u00f8yem said the territory needs more U.S. military investment to help defend it.",
      "\"I personally can't imagine Greenland becoming fully independent,\" H\u00f8yem said. \"Running a country that large with so few people is nearly impossible.\"",
      "Regardless of the future of Trump's Greenland proposal, H\u00f8yem said the land holds significant power.",
      "\"Trump might have looked at Greenland as a real estate deal, but for Denmark and Greenland, it's a matter of geopolitical survival,\" H\u00f8yem said. \"The Arctic is extremely important, and I agree with Trump on that.\"",

      "President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out.",
      "Although the new order will affect only a tiny fraction of America's 2.1 million service members, it has taken on oversized importance to Trump and his administration, who see transgender forces as a sign the military is \u201cwoke\u201d or not focused on training and winning wars.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, before he took the job, wrote in his book \u201cWar on Warriors\u201d that \u201cfor the recruits, for the military, and primarily for the security of the country, transgender people should never be allowed to serve. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",
      "Trump's order to push out transgender troops, issued late Monday night, was instantly condemned by an array of activist groups as exceptionally egregious and ultimately harmful to military readiness. They say transgender people have been serving successfully for years, including openly on and off for the past decade.",
      "Here's a look at what it all means and the confusing duel over the ban for the past decade.",
      "Trump's order essentially says that anyone who is diagnosed with gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease someone has when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 cannot serve in the military. It gives the defense secretary 60 days to update the medical standards for enlistment and re-enlistment to reflect that change. And it gives Hegseth 30 days to lay out how he plans to implement it all.",
      "According to the order, \u201cexpressing a false \u2018gender identity\u2019 divergent from an individual\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\u201d It says the hormonal and surgical needs involved in taking on a different gender identity \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.\"",
      "It concludes that, \u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "The order also zeroes in on the heady bathroom issue.",
      "On his first day in office Trump issued an executive order that he said would \u201crestore biological truth\u201d to the federal government by eliminating the word \u201cgender\u201d and replacing it with \u201csex.\u201d He said the federal government will only recognize people based on their sex at the time of conception based on their \u201creproductive cell.\u201d",
      "His latest order expands on that, saying the military will \u201cneither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females, nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon has said in recent years that it is impossible to count the total number of transgender troops. The military services say there is no way to track them and that much information is limited due to medical privacy laws.",
      "Estimates have hovered between 9,000 and 12,000. But it will be very difficult for officials to identify them, even as service members worry about the hunt to root them out.",
      "\u201cThis casts an enormous shadow on people that are getting ready to go on a deployment for six months overseas or, you know, getting ready to go on a combat mission,\u201d said Sasha Buchert, counsel for Lambda Legal. \u201cThis is going to be extremely disruptive. And they\u2019re going to have to look over their shoulder in fear of when the next shoe will fall.\u201d",
      "Since transgender troops have been able to serve openly for a number of years, it\u2019s possible their fellow unit members or commanders know who some of them are. That triggers worries about people identifying them in order to get them pushed out \u2014 and raises parallels to the Clinton administration's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which allowed gays to serve in the military as long as they didn't \u201ctell.\u201d",
      "In March 2018, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis released a memo with unprecedented details on the number of transgender forces and how many of them had sought mental health help or were planning to seek surgery.",
      "It said, at that time, there were 8,980 service members who identified themselves as transgender, and 937 had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The report said data collected by the military health system revealed that 424 of those service members diagnosed had gotten treatment plans approved and for at least 36 of them those plans didn't include \u201ccross sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery.\u201d",
      "In 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter broached the idea of lifting the ban on transgender troops and allowing them to serve openly, which raised concerns among military leaders. He set up a study, and then about a year later, in June 2016, announced the ban was ended.",
      "A year after that, just six months into his first presidential term, Trump suddenly announced via tweet he was not going to allow transgender people to serve in the military \u201cin any capacity.\u201d The tweets caught the Pentagon by surprise and plunged leaders into what became a roughly two-year struggle to hammer out the complex details of who would be affected by the ban and how it would work, even as legal challenges poured in.",
      "By March 2019, as courts ruled against the ban, the Pentagon laid out a policy that allowed those currently serving to continue with plans for hormone treatments and gender transition if they had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But it barred new enlistments of anyone with gender dysphoria who was taking hormones or had transitioned to another gender. And it said in the future those diagnosed with gender dysphoria must \u201cserve in their birth gender\u201d and were barred from taking hormones or getting transition surgery.",
      "Soon after President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he overturned Trump's ban and the Pentagon also announced it would cover transition medical expenses for troops.",
      "The chiefs of all four military services told members of Congress in 2018 they were seeing few problems as transgender troops began serving openly.",
      "The Navy chief at the time, Adm. John Richardson, said the Navy was dealing with the issue the same way it handled the integration of women sailors on submarines.",
      "And the Marine commandant then, Gen. Robert Neller, said there were no unit cohesion or discipline problems. His only concern, he told a Senate committee, was that some commanders were saying they had to spend \u201ca lot of time\u201d with transgender people as they worked through medical requirements involving their transition to their preferred gender.",
      "Sarah Klimm, a transgender Marine who served for 23 years, retired just as the end to the ban was announced in 2016, so was never able to serve openly.",
      "\u201dTrans military members that are out there right now are dropping bombs, pulling triggers, fixing all the weapons systems,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re looking to keep them away.\u201d",
      "Klimm, who is now a policy analyst for Minority Veterans of America, said it\u2019s an especially precarious time to remove thousands of service members as recruiting has been a struggle.",
      "Emily Shilling, who has been openly transgender since 2019, is currently serving as a commander in the Navy with more than 19 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "\u201cI just want to continue serving my country, using the skills this nation invested in me as a fighter pilot and leader,\u201d she said, stressing that she was speaking in her personal capacity. \"For nearly two decades, I\u2019ve upheld the highest standards of excellence, leading teams in combat and peace. All I ask is the opportunity to keep using my training and experience to serve this country with honor, courage and dedication.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump plans to sign the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration's first piece of legislation",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday will sign the Laken Riley Act into law as his administration's first piece of legislation. It mandates the detention and potential deportation of people in the U.S. illegally who are accused of theft and violent crimes before they've actually been convicted.",
      "The measure swiftly passed the Republican-controlled Congress with some Democratic support, despite immigrants rights advocates decrying it as extreme enough to possibly trigger mass roundups of people for offenses as minor as shoplifting.",
      "Trump has made a promised crackdown on illegal immigration unprecedented in the nation's history a centerpiece of his political career, however, and is now suggesting the law might only be the beginning.",
      "\u201cThis shows the potential for additional enforcement bills that will help us crack down on criminal aliens and totally restore the rule of law in our country,\" the president said at a conference of House Republicans held at his Doral golf club in Florida.",
      "The law is named for Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who went out for a run in February 2024 and was killed by Jose Antonio Ibarra, a Venezuelan national in the U.S. illegally. Ibarra was found guilty in November and sentenced to life without parole.",
      "\u201cTo have a bill of such importance named after her is a great, a great tribute,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis new form of crime, criminal, illegal aliens, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s massive, the numbers are massive and you add that to the crime we already had.\u201d",
      "The speed at which the act cleared Congress \u2014 and the fact that Trump is preparing to triumphantly sign it at the White House surrounded by lawmakers and other supportive, invited guests just nine days after taking office \u2014 adds to its potent political symbolism for conservatives. Critics say the measure is using a tragedy to effectively unleash chaos and cruelty while doing little to fight crime or fix an antiquated federal immigration system that hasn't been overhauled in decades.",
      "Under the Laken Riley Act, federal officials are required to detain any immigrant arrested or charged with crimes like theft or assaulting a police officer, or offenses that injure or kill someone. It further gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue the U.S. government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions \u2014 potentially allowing the leaders of conservative states to help dictate immigration policy set by Washington.",
      "Ibarra had been arrested for illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an unprecedented surge in migration, and released to pursue his case in immigration court. Federal officials say he was arrested by New York police in August 2023 for child endangerment and released. Police say he was also suspected of theft in Georgia in October 2023 \u2014 all of which occurred before Riley's killing.",
      "\u201cThis is the right thing to do,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said after the act cleared the House. \u201cIt\u2019s always good when the right thing is also the popular thing.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats, however, have questioned the act's constitutionality. Immigrant advocates are bracing for mass detentions that they say will trigger subsequent, costly construction of immigration lockup facilities to house the people arrested.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just get to celebrate. They get to use this for their mass deportation agenda,\u201d Naureen Shah, deputy director of government affairs in the equality division of the American Civil Liberties Union, said of the act's supporters.",
      "The ALCU says the act can allow people to be \u201cmandatorily locked up \u2014 potentially for years \u2014 because at some point in their lives, perhaps decades ago, they were accused of nonviolent offenses.\u201d",
      "Hannah Flamm, interim senior director of policy at the International Refugee Assistance Project, said the law violates immigrants' basic rights by allowing for detaining people who haven\u2019t been charged with, much less convicted of, wrongdoing. Still, she said, \u201cThe latent fear from the election cycle of looking soft on crime snowballed into aiding and abetting Trump\u2019s total conflation of immigration with crime.\"",
      "Flamm said the act is likely to be challenged in court on its parameters directing mandatory detentions, as well as its granting legal standing to state attorneys general in immigration cases and policy. But she also predicted that a need to pay for more immigration detention centers will give advocates a chance to challenge how federal funds are appropriated to cover those costs.",
      "\u201cI think it is pivotal to understand: This bill, framed as connected to a tragic death, is pretext to fortify a mass deportation system,\u201d Flamm said.",
      "The signing of the Laken Riley Act follows a flurry of first-week executive orders by Trump that are designed to better seal off the U.S.-Mexico border and eventually move to deport millions of immigrants without permanent U.S. legal status. The new administration has also canceled refugee resettlement and says it may attempt to prosecute local law enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration policies.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tracking down the illegal alien criminals and we\u2019re detaining them and we\u2019re throwing them the hell out of our country,\" Trump said. \"We have no apologies, and we\u2019re moving forward very fast.\u201d",

      "While the Trump administration said it would focus on deporting immigrants without legal status who have committed violent offenses first, as raids and mass deportations have continued, administration officials have said those without criminal records have also been deported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended what was happening at the second Trump administration's first White House press briefing on Tuesday.",
      "\"Every day, Americans are safer because of the violent criminals that President Trump's administration is removing from our communities,\" Leavitt said, adding that Trump \"is focused on launching the largest mass deportation operation in American history of illegal criminals.",
      "\"And you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are, by definition, a criminal,\" Leavitt said.",
      "When asked during the briefing which immigrants the Trump administration considers to have a \"criminal record,\" Leavitt said, \"All of them because they illegally broke our nation's laws, and therefore they are criminals. As far as this administration goes. I know the last administration didn't see it that way, so it's a big culture shift in our nation to view someone who breaks our immigration laws as a criminal. But that's exactly what they are.\"",

      "Nearly 60 senior USAID employees were placed on leave, sources said.",
      "Internal communications reviewed by ABC News show that the Trump administration plans to strictly implement an executive order from the president mandating a 90-day freeze on almost all U.S. foreign aid amid a review, a measure that already has sparked widespread concern among humanitarian organizations.",
      "\"We get tired of giving massive amounts of money to countries that hate us, don't we?\" President Donald Trump said in a speech during the House Republicans' annual retreat in Florida on Monday, touting a blizzard of executive actions he had taken since returning to the White House.",
      "In a memo sent to U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) staff over the weekend, a high-level official within the agency stressed their \"responsibility\" to carry out Trump's directive and signaled that it would be difficult to secure waivers to continue funding for programs during the pause, which he called \"a complete halt.\"",
      "\"It is important to emphasize that it is no longer business as usual. Every program will be thoroughly scrutinized,\" Ken Jackson, USAID's assistant to the administrator for management and resources, wrote.",
      "Jackson said that the agency's only exceptions currently in place covered spending on emergency humanitarian food aid and travel for government officials who were returning to their duty stations, adding that employees should be ready \"to provide detailed information and justification\" for these expenses.",
      "Any waivers for other spending would need to clear multiple hurdles for approval, including proving that the program receiving funding was lifesaving or necessary for U.S. national security.",
      "Failure to comply with the pause or other new policies \"will result in disciplinary action,\" Jackson warned USAID staff.",
      "That warning was not an empty threat. Late Monday, multiple sources said that nearly 60 senior USAID officials had been placed on leave, including nearly all senior attorneys for the agency.",
      "According to an email obtained by ABC News, acting USAID administrator Jason Gray accused the agency of skirting Trump's executive orders but provided no information about the alleged violations.",
      "\"We have identified several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President's Executive orders and the mandate from the American people,\" Gray wrote in the email. \"As a result, we have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice while we complete our analysis of these actions.\"",
      "A separate memo sent to State Department employees last week which was also reviewed by ABC News instructed officials overseeing projects funded by grants and awards that have already been distributed to issue immediate \"stop-work orders,\" making exceptions for some travel and administrative expenses, emergency food aid, and foreign military financing to both Egypt and Israel.",
      "An administration official said on Monday that a template for submitting waiver requests had been made available and that the State Department was reviewing numerous applications that had already been submitted, but could not give a timeline for when any decisions would be made.",
      "The State Department officially announced the implementation of the freeze on Sunday.",

      "By then, panic had already set in among international aid groups that rely on U.S. funding. Sources within the international community said the freeze was so expansive that they could hardly believe it was real.",
      "\"The recent stop-work cable from the State Department suspends programs that support America's global leadership and creates dangerous vacuums that China and our adversaries will quickly fill,\" InterAction, the largest alliance of international aid organizations, said in a statement.",
      "\"This halt interrupts critical life-saving work including clean water to infants, basic education for kids, ending the trafficking of girls, and providing medications to children and others suffering from disease. It stops assistance in countries critical to U.S. interests, including Taiwan, Syria, and Pakistan. And, it halts decades of life-saving work through PEPFAR that helps babies to be born HIV-free,\" the statement continued.",
      "Beyond concern for their work, some organizations and officials have also expressed confusion. Many were caught off guard by the State Department's implementation of Trump's order, which they initially believed wouldn't impact programs funded through congressional appropriations.",
      "\"The aid community is grappling with just how existential this aid suspension is - we know this will have life or death consequences for millions around the globe, as programs that depend on this funding grind to a halt without a plan or safety net,\" Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam, said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "\"This decision must be reversed, and funding and programming must be allowed to move forward. But at the very least, the administration must communicate clearly so the aid community can plan for the future and determine how to carry on our lifesaving work,\" Maxman added.",
      "Critics of the freeze believe dissent from international aid organizations and U.S. officials has been muted due to fear of retribution from the administration.",
      "In his memo to USAID employees, Jackson stipulated that one of the new policies they must comply with if they wished to avoid disciplinary action was a requirement that all external communication, including with the State Department, first be approved by the agency.",

      "\"Funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance, and other similar programs will not be paused,\" the document read. \"If agencies are concerned that these programs may implicate the President\u2019s Executive Orders, they should consult OMB to begin to unwind these objectionable policies without a pause in the payments.\"",
      "Still, the pause could have sweeping implication as the federal government funds thousands of programs, including housing subsidies and educational grants.",

      "\"This is a work in progress. Everybody. Take a deep breath. Stay calm. Every one of these programs is going to be looked at,\" GOP Sen. James Risch said, arguing that Trump is taking this action as a way to tackle inflation and oversized government spending.",

      "Florida lawmakers have passed a sweeping immigration bill, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on people in the country illegally",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida lawmakers passed a sweeping immigration bill Tuesday, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump 's crackdown on those in the country illegally.",
      "In a state where roughly one in every five residents is an immigrant, the legislation would require every level of government \u2014 as well as government contractors \u2014 to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "Following more than four hours of deliberations on Tuesday, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature passed the measure largely along party lines. The passage sets up a showdown between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and state legislative leaders, who have sparred over whose proposals would better carry out Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. DeSantis has called the bill \u201cweak.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\u201d said Republican Sen. Gruters, one of the bill sponsors and a Trump ally who said he spoke with the president while shepherding the measure. \u201cHe wants maximum coordination with local government.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers pushed the 80-plus page bill \u2014 titled the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP Act \u2014 through in a special session, when it's harder for the public to engage in the legislative process. Republican lawmakers filed the bill after rejecting immigration proposals by DeSantis, a rebuke to the lame duck governor who was once floated as Trump's successor.",
      "Notably, one Republican in the House and six in the Senate voted against the measure, leaving the bill short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "\u201cI appreciate the attempt,\u201d said Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, an ally of the governor. \u201cI cannot vote for this because it is nowhere near strong enough for my taste.\"",
      "Ahead of the floor debate on Tuesday, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced additional provisions, after they \u201crequested and received technical assistance from the Trump Administration\u201d, the leaders said.",
      "The amendments included enhancing penalties for all crimes committed in the state by people in the country illegally, and requires that those convicted of capital offenses receive the death penalty. But the Republican sponsors declined to include some of DeSantis' provisions, like restrictions on people in the country illegally sending money overseas and a measure that would have created a legal presumption that people in the country illegally are a flight risk.",
      "Now DeSantis must weigh whether to sign a proposal he's bashed in public as \u201ctoothless\u201d and \u201cwatered-down\" or veto it. He could also decline to sign the bill, allowing it to become law.",
      "The measure passed by lawmakers Tuesday would create a new state immigration enforcement office with more than 140 employees under the direction of a newly minted chief immigration officer, a post to be taken by the state's commissioner of agriculture, and would cede emergency immigration enforcement powers from the governor to the state immigration officer.",
      "The bill allocates $100 million for grants to local law enforcement agencies for training, equipment and reimbursement for leasing detention facilities to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It allocates another $375 million to fund the state's cooperation with the federal government, including efforts related to a program that deputizes local law enforcement for duties typically performed by ICE agents. It also sets aside $25 million to give $1,000 bonuses to local law enforcement officers who cooperate with the federal government.",
      "Democrats repeatedly pressed the bill sponsors on the language requiring government employees to \u201ccooperate to the fullest extent possible\u201d with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf we really don\u2019t want our (school resource officers), our social workers and our teachers defining for themselves what the fullest extent of their cooperation needs to be, then we need to define that,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Christine Hunchofsky.",
      "Gruters said the bill is aimed at requiring more cooperation from local officials running jails and detention facilities, not \u201cstreet-level\u201d enforcement. But he acknowledged that could change with federal priorities.",
      "The bill would also repeal a decade-old state law allowing Florida students who are in the country without legal permission to qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities, which as of the 2023-2024 fiscal year benefitted about 6,500 students. In a sign of how much the state's immigration politics have changed in recent years, the tuition measure was sponsored in 2014 by the state's now-lieutenant governor, a Republican from Miami.",
      "\u201cI implore you today to remember the haunting yet challenging words of our lieutenant governor when she said, 'It's the right thing to do',\" Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson told his colleagues on the Senate floor. \"And what has changed since then except an attitude towards immigrants?\u201d",
      "Democratic Rep. Jose Alvarez, who was born in Cuba and was brought the U.S. by his parents, was more forceful.",
      "\u201cYou all should be ashamed of yourself,\" he told lawmakers during a hearing on the bill, adding \"This is not what this country was meant for.\u201d",
      "The provision empowering the state's agriculture commissioner as chief immigration officer has rankled DeSantis, who said \u201cit\u2019s almost like the fox guarding the hen house\u201d because the agriculture industry hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen known for immigration enforcement.\u201d",
      "In his closing remarks, Speaker Perez seemed to nod at the pressure Republicans have faced from the governor and his allies.",
      "\u201cThreatening others to get your way isn\u2019t leadership, it\u2019s immaturity,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI\u2019m going ask you to ignore the melodrama and instead focus on the work that we have to do.\u201d",
      "Florida is among many states led by both parties responding to Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, including Tennessee, which started its own special session Monday in part to deal with the issue.",

      "The order would close the path for transgender troops to serve openly",
      "Transgender service members represented by LGBTQ advocacy groups on Tuesday filed suit against the White House executive order that bans transgender people from serving in the military.",
      "The order signed late Monday rescinded Biden administration policies that permitted transgender service members to serve openly according to their gender identity. The order said the \u201cassertion\u201d that one might identify as transgender would be a \u201cfalsehood \u2026 not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "Space Force Col. Bree Fram, a transgender woman who came out and transitioned while serving, told ABC News that banning transgender individuals from serving would bring a \u201ccollective harm to our national security.\u201d",
      "Transgender troops \u201care meeting or exceeding the high standards the military has set for performance, and they're doing so here at home, around the world, and in every service, every specialty that the military has to offer,\u201d Fram said, who was speaking in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the Pentagon.",
      "According to the suit filed Tuesday by plaintiffs represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders Law and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the order directs Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth \u201cto reverse the current accession and retention standards for military service and to adopt instead a policy that transgender status is incompatible with \u2018high standards\u2019\u201d that the executive order lays out.",
      "Sasha Buchert, a senior attorney at Lambda Legal who represented plaintiffs who sued and temporarily blocked a similar order in 2017 in the first Trump administration, called the new order \u201ccruel\u201d and said it \u201ccompromises the safety of our country.\u201d",
      "She told ABC News the order \u201cwill force transgender service members to look over their shoulder\u201d and \u201cstamp them with [a] badge of inferiority.\u201d",
      "Buchert said her firm and the Human Rights Campaign also intend to file suit.",
      "\u201cWe have been here before\u2026as we promised then, so do we now: we will sue,\u201d Buchert said.",
      "Buchert said transgender troops will now \u201cworry about...whether they're going to have to end their illustrious military careers by being drummed out of the military.\u201d",
      "\"Trans military folks have been serving now for 10 years, openly and proudly and deploying to austere environments and meeting every service-based standard that their peers can meet,\" said Buchert, who is a veteran.",
      "The executive order, paired with another that demands the dissolution of diversity, equity, and inclusion \"bureaucracy\" in the Defense Department, came on Hegseth\u2019s first day of work at the Pentagon.",
      "A 2016 study conducted by RAND estimated 2,500 active service members were transgender -- in addition to some 1,500 reservists.",
      "RAND found in its study that the number of active-duty troops seeking transition-related care that \u201ccould disrupt their ability to deploy\u201d ranged from as low as 29 to as high as 129.",
      "The Department of Defense does not track transgender individuals as a separate population.",
      "The executive order does not make reference to transgender individuals. It directs the Pentagon to update guidelines around medical standards for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria, a precursor to transition care that affirms one\u2019s gender.",
      "The Pentagon said in a statement to ABC News that it \u201cwill fully execute and implement all directives outlined\u201d in all executive orders from the president.",
      "Trump as a candidate said he would take aim at \"transgender insanity\" as president. The order says the military must root out \u201cideologies harmful to unit cohesion.\u201d",
      "The logic around cohesion is familiar, Buchert said.",
      "\u201cWe've seen this as a country on many occasions. We're still correcting improper discharges for people that were, you know, drummed out of the military based on discriminatory motives in the past,\u201d she said.",
      "Cassie Byard, a Navy veteran who served with a service member who was transgender, said she \u201cnever saw any adverse effect on readiness or cohesion.\u201d",
      "Fram believes openness about her identity has made her unit more cohesive.",
      "\"My being authentic is actually reflected back to me and builds the strong bonds of teamwork that we need at the military to succeed, because we need everyone to be able to bring their best self to work,\u201d she said.",
      "While the order brings a \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d as the Pentagon weighs updates to medical guidelines over a two-month window to implement it, Fram said \u201cmy job right now, and the job of every transgender service member, is simply to do our duty. It's to lace up our boots and get to work and accomplish the mission that we've been given.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe swore an oath to uphold the duties that we've been given, [to] support the Constitution,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we're going to continue to do so, unless told otherwise.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:04:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Presidential immunity does not protect Donald Trump from having to pay E. Jean Carroll tens of millions of dollars for defaming her, Carroll's lawyer argued Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Trump is appealing a jury's verdict that awarded Carroll $83 million in damages.",
      "Presidential immunity does not protect Donald Trump from having to pay tens of millions of dollars in damages after being held liable for defaming magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, a lawyer for Carroll told a federal appeals court in a filing Monday.",
      "After being awarded an $83.3 million defamation judgment from a jury last year, Carroll on Monday urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to uphold the judgment against Trump, after Trump asked the court to toss out the verdict because he had immunity as president.",
      "\"Dissatisfied with the outcome of the judicial process, Trump now asks this Court to set aside that jury verdict on the theory that he was actually immune from judicial review all along,\" Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan wrote in the filing.",
      "In 2023, a jury held Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll in a dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the 1990s, awarding Carroll $5 million in damages. A year later, a different jury in a separate trial ordered Trump to pay Carroll $83 million in damages for defaming her in a 2022 social media post in which he called her allegations \"a Hoax and a lie\" and said \"This woman is not my type!\"",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the $5 million judgment in December, and Trump's appeal of the $83 million judgement is ongoing.",
      "In September, Trump attorney D. John Sauer -- who Trump nominated in November to serve as the new solicitor general -- told a federal appeals court that the $83 million judgment should be thrown out based on a flawed jury instruction, a series of \"highly prejudicial errors\" during the trial, and because presidential immunity protects Trump from liability for public statements made as president.",
      "\"Presidential immunity forecloses any liability here and requires the complete dismissal of all claims,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "In her reply brief filed Monday, Kaplan pushed back against Trump's assertion of immunity, arguing that statements Trump made about Carroll as president would clearly fall outside of his official responsibilities.",
      "\"If there were ever a case where immunity does not shield a President's speech, this one is it,\" Kaplan wrote. \"Donald Trump was not speaking here about a governmental policy or a function of his responsibilities as President. He was defaming Carroll because of her revelation that many years before he assumed office, he sexually assaulted her.\"",
      "Carroll's attorney argued that the $83 million judgement was justified to deter Trump from further defamatory statements, a risk that Kaplan said the jury saw firsthand. Trump attended most days of the 2024 trial, criticizing Carroll as a liar from his seat in the courtroom and sparring with the judge who oversaw the case.",
      "\"Throughout the trial, the jury had a front-row seat to Trump's relentless campaign of malice, including his repeated defamation of Carroll at press conferences he held and in statements he posted on social media while the trial was ongoing,\" Kaplan wrote.",

      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

    "story": [
      "Victims of a deadly 2023 Hawaii wildfire that decimated the town of Lahaina are expected to testify in court during an unusual trial to determine how to divide a potential $4 billion settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- When Hawaii Gov. Josh Green announced a $4 billion settlement about a year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023, he touted the speed of the deal to \u201cavoid protracted and painful lawsuits.\u201d",
      "Five months later, however, an unusual trial starting Wednesday will delve into difficult questions about survivors\u2019 losses as a judge decides how to divide the settlement. Some victims will take the witness stand, while others have submitted pre-recorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "The trial won't determine fault. Defendants blamed for the blaze including the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric and large landowners have already agreed to the settlement amount.",
      "At issue is how much money various groups of plaintiffs might receive, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their family members, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who simply had to cancel trips to Maui following the inferno.",
      "Lawyers for the two groups failed to come to an agreement, leaving it up to Judge Peter Cahill to determine how the $4 billion should be shared.",
      "\u201cA class action is everybody suffering the same loss,\u201d said Damon Valverde, whose Lahaina sunglasses company burned. \u201cAnd I suffered quite a bit more than others, and others suffered quite a bit more than me.\u201d",
      "Valverde isn't expected to testify; the focus should be on victims who lost family members, he said.",
      "Those include Kevin Baclig, whose wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the 102 people known to have died.",
      "Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them \u2014 from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter. \u201cI clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,\u201d he said.",
      "A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife\u2019s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.",
      "\u201cThe loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.\u201d",
      "The class action includes some people who lost homes and businesses, but also tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled. Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go toward that group, said Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing victims \u2014 like Baclig \u2014 who have filed their own lawsuits, known as the \"individual plaintiffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,\u201d Lowenthal said.",
      "Attorneys representing the class didn't respond to messages from The Associated Press. In their trial brief, they challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over has already done so. Many people have held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire's disruption to life, \"distrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first.\u201d",
      "Further complicating the matter are questions before the state Supreme Court, which is considering whether insurers can separately sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 billion-plus they have paid out as a result of the fire, or whether their share must come from the $4 billion settlement.",
      "If the court says insurers can sue separately, that will likely torpedo the entire deal. Preventing insurers from going after the defendants is a key settlement term, and allowing them to do so would drain the money available for fire victims and lead to prolonged litigation, lawyers for the individual plaintiffs say.",

Branden Silverman said responding to a fire and determining evacuation needs can take some time.",
      "It\u2019s an increasingly common issue: After-action reports and investigations revealed issues with alert systems in other California blazes: in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people in Santa Rosa; the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in Paradise; the Woolsey fire, which started the same day and killed three in Malibu; as well as in Colorado's 2021 Marshall Fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes outside Denver; and in Hawaii's 2023 Lahaina Fire, which decimated that historic town and killed 102.",
      "It could take months to know why some evacuation orders lagged in the Los Angeles fires.",
      "Several residents who lost homes in the Eaton Fire told The Associated Press they received no notifications about their neighborhoods. For others, the first warning was an urgent text message in the middle of the night.",
      "Susan Lee, who signed up for the alert app Nixle, did not get any alerts specific to her west Altadena neighborhood before she and her family left of their own accord around 10 p.m. after losing power and cell reception.",
      "\u201cIf we had even been informed that houses and other structures were burning down, we would have known better what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cWe almost went to sleep that night with two kids and a dog and two cats in the house.\u201d",
      "Only after 3 a.m. did an alert hit her phone. Destroyed along with the house are the Christmas ornaments she saved for her children, and countless other family keepsakes.",
      "\u201cWe lost everything, everything,\u201d Lee said, breaking into tears.",
      "Tricia Wachtendorf, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware, said alerts have to be specific and clear. Research has shown that for them to be effective, people have to hear, understand, believe, personalize and confirm them before they react.",
      "\u201cJust because you send the message at 3 a.m. doesn\u2019t mean someone is hearing it,\u201d Wachtendorf said.",
      "The hours between midnight and 3:30 a.m. appear to have been particularly challenging for first responders in Los Angeles County, based on an AP review of scanner traffic recordings and data from CalFire, the state's chief fire agency; the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA; and the Watch Duty app.",
      "Resources were stretched thin, and hurricane-force winds had grounded air support, limiting authorities' ability to get a top-down perspective on the flames.",
      "Calls reporting burning homes were flooding in as embers blew onto roofs and yards. During one half-hour period, 17 new addresses were relayed to firefighters, even as some crews ran low on fuel.",
      "By 12:07 a.m., CalFire records show, dozens of neighborhoods had been ordered to evacuate because of the Eaton Fire, all of them east of Altadena's North Lake Avenue. None of the neighborhoods to the west \u2014 where all of the 17 confirmed fatalities occurred, as first reported by the Los Angeles Times \u2014 had received evacuation warnings or orders, despite house fires being reported there more than an hour earlier.",
      "Over the next three hours, fire crews would go from begging for resources on the eastern flank of the blaze to radioing the command center to make sure it knew the fire was spreading west along the foothills near Sunset Ridge.",
      "Just before 3:30 a.m., evacuation orders expanded significantly, with residents in 12 areas of Altadena and elsewhere told to \u201cleave now.\u201d",
      "Jodi and Jeff Moreno first heard about the fire from a neighborhood app. But the first official warning only came around 2:30 a.m., when authorities yelled through a bullhorn to evacuate. The couple grabbed their three daughters, their dog and some important papers, and fled.",
      "There were no text alerts until after they were gone.",
      "\u201cOn the neighborhood apps, some people were going, some people were staying. It was a wide variety of responses. We were navigating it on our own,\u201d Jodi Moreno said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to gauge where exactly is that fire, where are the embers blowing. ... Those are things I would rely on people who are monitoring it\u201d for information.",
      "Desperate for more information, both the Morenos and Lee downloaded the Watch Duty app, which maps evacuation zones and consolidates information from multiple sources into a single stream. Launched in 2021 and today covering 22 states, it became a lifeline for them.",
      "\u201cThe ideal system for warning people is informing them, right?\u201d said Nick Russell, vice president for operations at Watch Duty.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly diligence necessary in the execution of official evacuation warning and orders or shelter in place, whatever the condition might be,\u201d he said. \"But telling people why that discussion is taking place between law enforcement and fire is important. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "The process of issuing evacuation notices starts with firefighters or other personnel on the ground recommending action, Russell said. It then moves up the chain of command to sheriffs, who ultimately put out any order.",
      "During major emergencies that communication can be hampered by issues such as limited radio connectivity, wind noise or other technical problems. Incident command stations may have trouble synthesizing the large amounts of information they are getting from different agencies, something that is critical for understanding the scope of an emergency like a fire.",
      "In Los Angeles County, residents who sign up for emergency notifications through the AlertLACounty website are then directed to a list of 57 links to other specific neighborhood or city alert system signups, as well as a general one covering 19 other cities. The city of Los Angeles and the Sheriff's Department also have alert systems.",
      "It is not clear how the overlapping systems, which use different software programs, work together, or whether officials coordinate.",
      "A 2024 Hazard Mitigation plan directed the city's Emergency Management Department to assess gaps in alert and warning systems in areas with poor cellphone connectivity and then implement a solution to ensure alerts reach people. But that goal was given a \u201cmedium\u201d priority level and a long-term timeline, with completion expected sometime in the next 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile the county's Hazard Mitigation Plan, last updated in 2020, did not include a focus on emergency alerts or public notifications. Instead its high-priority goals had to do with educating people about wind's impact on wildfire risk and with community wildfire protection.",
      "Officials at the County\u2019s Coordinated Joint Information Center declined to comment other than to say that an independent review of evacuations and emergency notifications is planned and the Office of Emergency Management, County Fire Department and Sheriff\u2019s Department plan to fully engage with it."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 03:16:14 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out.",
      "Although the new order will affect only a tiny fraction of America's 2.1 million service members, it has taken on oversized importance to Trump and his administration, who see transgender forces as a sign the military is \u201cwoke\u201d or not focused on training and winning wars.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, before he took the job, wrote in his book \u201cWar on Warriors\u201d that \u201cfor the recruits, for the military, and primarily for the security of the country, transgender people should never be allowed to serve. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",
      "Trump's order to push out transgender troops, issued late Monday night, was instantly condemned by an array of activist groups as exceptionally egregious and ultimately harmful to military readiness. They say transgender people have been serving successfully for years, including openly on and off for the past decade.",
      "Here's a look at what it all means and the confusing duel over the ban for the past decade.",
      "Trump's order essentially says that anyone who is diagnosed with gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease someone has when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 cannot serve in the military. It gives the defense secretary 60 days to update the medical standards for enlistment and re-enlistment to reflect that change. And it gives Hegseth 30 days to lay out how he plans to implement it all.",
      "According to the order, \u201cexpressing a false \u2018gender identity\u2019 divergent from an individual\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\u201d It says the hormonal and surgical needs involved in taking on a different gender identity \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.\"",
      "It concludes that, \u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "The order also zeroes in on the heady bathroom issue.",
      "On his first day in office Trump issued an executive order that he said would \u201crestore biological truth\u201d to the federal government by eliminating the word \u201cgender\u201d and replacing it with \u201csex.\u201d He said the federal government will only recognize people based on their sex at the time of conception based on their \u201creproductive cell.\u201d",
      "His latest order expands on that, saying the military will \u201cneither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females, nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon has said in recent years that it is impossible to count the total number of transgender troops. The military services say there is no way to track them and that much information is limited due to medical privacy laws.",
      "Estimates have hovered between 9,000 and 12,000. But it will be very difficult for officials to identify them, even as service members worry about the hunt to root them out.",
      "\u201cThis casts an enormous shadow on people that are getting ready to go on a deployment for six months overseas or, you know, getting ready to go on a combat mission,\u201d said Sasha Buchert, counsel for Lambda Legal. \u201cThis is going to be extremely disruptive. And they\u2019re going to have to look over their shoulder in fear of when the next shoe will fall.\u201d",
      "Since transgender troops have been able to serve openly for a number of years, it\u2019s possible their fellow unit members or commanders know who some of them are. That triggers worries about people identifying them in order to get them pushed out \u2014 and raises parallels to the Clinton administration's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which allowed gays to serve in the military as long as they didn't \u201ctell.\u201d",
      "In March 2018, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis released a memo with unprecedented details on the number of transgender forces and how many of them had sought mental health help or were planning to seek surgery.",
      "It said, at that time, there were 8,980 service members who identified themselves as transgender, and 937 had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The report said data collected by the military health system revealed that 424 of those service members diagnosed had gotten treatment plans approved and for at least 36 of them those plans didn't include \u201ccross sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery.\u201d",
      "In 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter broached the idea of lifting the ban on transgender troops and allowing them to serve openly, which raised concerns among military leaders. He set up a study, and then about a year later, in June 2016, announced the ban was ended.",
      "A year after that, just six months into his first presidential term, Trump suddenly announced via tweet he was not going to allow transgender people to serve in the military \u201cin any capacity.\u201d The tweets caught the Pentagon by surprise and plunged leaders into what became a roughly two-year struggle to hammer out the complex details of who would be affected by the ban and how it would work, even as legal challenges poured in.",
      "By March 2019, as courts ruled against the ban, the Pentagon laid out a policy that allowed those currently serving to continue with plans for hormone treatments and gender transition if they had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But it barred new enlistments of anyone with gender dysphoria who was taking hormones or had transitioned to another gender. And it said in the future those diagnosed with gender dysphoria must \u201cserve in their birth gender\u201d and were barred from taking hormones or getting transition surgery.",
      "Soon after President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he overturned Trump's ban and the Pentagon also announced it would cover transition medical expenses for troops.",
      "The chiefs of all four military services told members of Congress in 2018 they were seeing few problems as transgender troops began serving openly.",
      "The Navy chief at the time, Adm. John Richardson, said the Navy was dealing with the issue the same way it handled the integration of women sailors on submarines.",
      "And the Marine commandant then, Gen. Robert Neller, said there were no unit cohesion or discipline problems. His only concern, he told a Senate committee, was that some commanders were saying they had to spend \u201ca lot of time\u201d with transgender people as they worked through medical requirements involving their transition to their preferred gender.",
      "Sarah Klimm, a transgender Marine who served for 23 years, retired just as the end to the ban was announced in 2016, so was never able to serve openly.",
      "\u201dTrans military members that are out there right now are dropping bombs, pulling triggers, fixing all the weapons systems,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re looking to keep them away.\u201d",
      "Klimm, who is now a policy analyst for Minority Veterans of America, said it\u2019s an especially precarious time to remove thousands of service members as recruiting has been a struggle.",
      "Emily Shilling, who has been openly transgender since 2019, is currently serving as a commander in the Navy with more than 19 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "\u201cI just want to continue serving my country, using the skills this nation invested in me as a fighter pilot and leader,\u201d she said, stressing that she was speaking in her personal capacity. \"For nearly two decades, I\u2019ve upheld the highest standards of excellence, leading teams in combat and peace. All I ask is the opportunity to keep using my training and experience to serve this country with honor, courage and dedication.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Florida lawmakers have passed a sweeping immigration bill, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on people in the country illegally",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida lawmakers passed a sweeping immigration bill Tuesday, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump 's crackdown on those in the country illegally.",
      "In a state where roughly one in every five residents is an immigrant, the legislation would require every level of government \u2014 as well as government contractors \u2014 to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "Following more than four hours of deliberations on Tuesday, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature passed the measure largely along party lines. The passage sets up a showdown between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and state legislative leaders, who have sparred over whose proposals would better carry out Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. DeSantis has called the bill \u201cweak.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\u201d said Republican Sen. Gruters, one of the bill sponsors and a Trump ally who said he spoke with the president while shepherding the measure. \u201cHe wants maximum coordination with local government.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers pushed the 80-plus page bill \u2014 titled the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP Act \u2014 through in a special session, when it's harder for the public to engage in the legislative process. Republican lawmakers filed the bill after rejecting immigration proposals by DeSantis, a rebuke to the lame duck governor who was once floated as Trump's successor.",
      "Notably, one Republican in the House and six in the Senate voted against the measure, leaving the bill short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "\u201cI appreciate the attempt,\u201d said Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, an ally of the governor. \u201cI cannot vote for this because it is nowhere near strong enough for my taste.\"",
      "Ahead of the floor debate on Tuesday, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced additional provisions, after they \u201crequested and received technical assistance from the Trump Administration\u201d, the leaders said.",
      "The amendments included enhancing penalties for all crimes committed in the state by people in the country illegally, and requires that those convicted of capital offenses receive the death penalty. But the Republican sponsors declined to include some of DeSantis' provisions, like restrictions on people in the country illegally sending money overseas and a measure that would have created a legal presumption that people in the country illegally are a flight risk.",
      "Now DeSantis must weigh whether to sign a proposal he's bashed in public as \u201ctoothless\u201d and \u201cwatered-down\" or veto it. He could also decline to sign the bill, allowing it to become law.",
      "The measure passed by lawmakers Tuesday would create a new state immigration enforcement office with more than 140 employees under the direction of a newly minted chief immigration officer, a post to be taken by the state's commissioner of agriculture, and would cede emergency immigration enforcement powers from the governor to the state immigration officer.",
      "The bill allocates $100 million for grants to local law enforcement agencies for training, equipment and reimbursement for leasing detention facilities to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It allocates another $375 million to fund the state's cooperation with the federal government, including efforts related to a program that deputizes local law enforcement for duties typically performed by ICE agents. It also sets aside $25 million to give $1,000 bonuses to local law enforcement officers who cooperate with the federal government.",
      "Democrats repeatedly pressed the bill sponsors on the language requiring government employees to \u201ccooperate to the fullest extent possible\u201d with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf we really don\u2019t want our (school resource officers), our social workers and our teachers defining for themselves what the fullest extent of their cooperation needs to be, then we need to define that,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Christine Hunchofsky.",
      "Gruters said the bill is aimed at requiring more cooperation from local officials running jails and detention facilities, not \u201cstreet-level\u201d enforcement. But he acknowledged that could change with federal priorities.",
      "The bill would also repeal a decade-old state law allowing Florida students who are in the country without legal permission to qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities, which as of the 2023-2024 fiscal year benefitted about 6,500 students. In a sign of how much the state's immigration politics have changed in recent years, the tuition measure was sponsored in 2014 by the state's now-lieutenant governor, a Republican from Miami.",
      "\u201cI implore you today to remember the haunting yet challenging words of our lieutenant governor when she said, 'It's the right thing to do',\" Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson told his colleagues on the Senate floor. \"And what has changed since then except an attitude towards immigrants?\u201d",
      "Democratic Rep. Jose Alvarez, who was born in Cuba and was brought the U.S. by his parents, was more forceful.",
      "\u201cYou all should be ashamed of yourself,\" he told lawmakers during a hearing on the bill, adding \"This is not what this country was meant for.\u201d",
      "The provision empowering the state's agriculture commissioner as chief immigration officer has rankled DeSantis, who said \u201cit\u2019s almost like the fox guarding the hen house\u201d because the agriculture industry hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen known for immigration enforcement.\u201d",
      "In his closing remarks, Speaker Perez seemed to nod at the pressure Republicans have faced from the governor and his allies.",
      "\u201cThreatening others to get your way isn\u2019t leadership, it\u2019s immaturity,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI\u2019m going ask you to ignore the melodrama and instead focus on the work that we have to do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has heard competing testimony over a request to block the nation's fourth execution using nitrogen gas",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The state of Alabama urged a federal judge Tuesday to allow the nation's fourth execution with nitrogen gas to proceed next week, but a doctor who witnessed an earlier execution by the new method told the judge the inmate appeared to be in distress and awake minutes longer than officials predicted.",
      "Alabama has carried out all three of the nation's executions using the gas and has set a Feb. 6 execution date for Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52. But attorneys for Frazier, who was convicted of the 1991 rape and murder of a woman in Birmingham, sought the hearing asking the court to intervene.",
      "Frazier\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to its protocol, such as giving the inmate the same sedative used at the start of lethal injections before the gas begins flowing. Separately Tuesday, Frazier's mother and death penalty opponents asked Michigan's governor to bring Frazier back there to finish a life sentence in the state for a separate murder conviction in the killing of a 14-year-old girl. Michigan has no death penalty.",
      "Alabama's method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen. The state maintained Tuesday that the method brings swift death.",
      "Dylan L. Mauldin, assistant solicitor general for Alabama, called Frazier\u2019s legal maneuver a tactic to delay his execution and said the court should deny his request for a preliminary injunction. Mauldin noted the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled the method unconstitutional.",
      "Meanwhile, a lawyer for Frazier, argued that inmates executed with the gas appeared to be conscious for some minutes, instead of the 30 to 40 seconds he said the state predicted.",
      "U.S. District Judge Emily Marks questioned Frazier\u2019s attorney about why she should intervene when the courts have previously let nitrogen executions go forward.",
      "\u201cSomething is going wrong. Every inmate who has been executed by nitrogen gas has exhibited signs of consciousness beyond the 40 seconds,\u201d Spencer Hahn, an attorney for Frazier, responded.",
      "Dr. Brian McAlary, an anesthesiologist who witnessed the November execution of Carey Dale Grayson, testified that he observed clear \u201cevidence of distress\u201d in the prisoner. He noted Grayson moved his head back and forth, had rapid eye movements and struggled against his restraints.",
      "McAlary said he believed Grayson\u2019s last voluntary movement occurred after about three minutes when he simultaneously raised both legs and held them in the air before letting them fall down. McAlary said he believed the movement was voluntary because \u201cboth legs were moved at exactly the same time, direction and distance.\u201d",

      "The department's accusation that the move may violate of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, appears to be unprecedented, and it marks a sharp departure from the department's investigations under former President Joe Biden.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is offering buyouts to all federal employees who opt to leave their jobs by next week \u2014 an unprecedented move to shrink the U.S. government at breakneck speed.",
      "A memo from the Office of Personnel Management, the government\u2019s human resources agency, also said it would begin subjecting all federal employees to \u201cenhanced standards of suitability and conduct\u201d and ominously warned of future downsizing. The email sent to millions of employees said those who leave their posts voluntarily will receive about eight months of salary, but they have to choose to do so by Feb. 6.",
      "President Donald Trump has built a political career around promising to disrupt Washington, and vowed that his second administration would go far further in shaking up traditional political norms than his first did. Still, the repercussions of so many government workers being invited to leave their jobs were difficult to calculate.",
      "Katie Miller, who serves on an advisory board to the Department of Government Efficiency, a special Trump administration department headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and tasked with shrinking the size of government, posted on X, \u201cThis email is being sent to more than TWO MILLION federal employees.\u201d",
      "The federal government employed more than 3 million people as of November last year, which accounted for nearly 1.9% of the nation\u2019s entire civilian workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. The average tenure for a federal employee is nearly 12 years, according to a Pew analysis of data from OPM.",
      "Even a fraction of the workforce accepting buyouts could send shockwaves through the economy and trigger widespread disruptions throughout society as a whole, triggering wide-ranging \u2014 and as yet unknowable \u2014 implications for the delivery, timeliness and effectiveness of federal services across the nation.",
      "Untold numbers of front-line health workers in the Veterans Affairs Department, officials who process loans for homebuyers or small businesses, and contractors who help procure the next generation of military weaponry could all head for the exits at once. It could also mean losing experienced food inspectors and scientists who test the water supply \u2014 while disrupting everything from air travel and consumer product protections.",
      "In response, American Federation of Government Employees union President Everett Kelley said it should not be viewed as voluntary buyouts, but pressuring workers not considered loyal to the new administration to vacate their jobs.",
      "\u201cPurging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,\u201d Kelley said in a statement. \"Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration\u2019s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.\u201d",
      "In its emailed memo detailing its plan, OPM lists four directives that it says Trump is mandating for the federal workforce going forward \u2014 including that most workers return to their offices full-time.",
      "\u201cThe substantial majority of federal employees who have been working remotely since Covid will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,\u201d it reads. That echoes Trump, who said of federal employees over the weekend: \u201cYou have to go to your office and work. Otherwise you\u2019re not going to have a job.\u201d",
      "The memo also says Trump \u201cwill insist on excellence at every level,\u201d and while some parts of the government's workforce may increase under his administration, \u201cThe majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized.\"",
      "Finally, it says, the \u201dfederal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work.\"",
      "\u201cEmployees will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward,\u201d the memo reads.",
      "The emailed message includes a \u201cdeferred resignation letter\u201d for federal employees to begin leaving their posts.",
      "\u201cIf you resign under this program, you will retain all pay and benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until September 30,\u201d it says.",
      "The email even includes instructions on how to accept, stating: \"If you wish to resign: Select \u2018Reply\u2019 to this email. You must reply from your government account.\" It adds: \u201cType the word \u2018Resign' into the body of this email and hit \u2018send.\u2019\"",
      "Meanwhile, OPM has released guidance for an executive order Trump signed on the first day of his second term known as \u201cSchedule Career/Policy.\u201d It replaces Schedule F, an order Trump signed late in his first term that sought to reclassify thousands of federal employees and make them political appointees without the same job security protections.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded Trump\u2019s Schedule F order almost immediately upon taking office in 2021, and under his administration, OPM issued a new rule last year designed to make it more difficult to fire many federal employees.",
      "That move was seen as a safeguard against using a new Schedule F order to help carry out the key goals of Project 2025, a sweeping plan by a conservative Washington think tank to dismiss large swaths of the federal workforce in favor of more conservative alternatives while also cutting back on the overall size of government.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Trump administration from swiftly moving to gut the federal workforce and leave employees with little recourse to protest firings or reassignments.",

    "story": [
      "The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group is on trial for conspiring to attack Maryland\u2019s power grid",
      "BALTIMORE -- As the founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group goes on trial for conspiring to attack Maryland\u2019s power grid, his abhorrent beliefs aren\u2019t really the point, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "They said it is his willingness to act on those beliefs that jurors must consider during the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks in Baltimore federal court.",
      "Brandon Russell, 29, encouraged his then-girlfriend, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, to carry out the power grid attack, hoping to cause chaos in furtherance of their shared white supremacist views, according to prosecutors. The two were arrested in February 2023 \u2014 before their plans were executed.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell was at war. He was at war for his race, the white race,\u201d prosecutor Michael Aubin said during opening arguments Tuesday afternoon.",
      "According to prosecutors, the pair was planning a series of \u201csniper attacks\u201d on electrical substations around Baltimore that could have caused significant damage to the regional power grid. Their goal was to create chaos in the majority-Black city and ultimately spur a \u201crace war,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "But Russell\u2019s defense attorney argued his participation in the plot was minimal, calling the case \u201ca setup from the very beginning.\u201d While downplaying Russell\u2019s role, attorney Ian Goldstein pinned the conspiracy on Clendaniel and a confidential informant she connected with through Russell.",
      "Clendaniel, 36, pleaded guilty to plotting the attack and was sentenced in September to 18 years in prison.",
      "Russell appeared in court Tuesday wearing a light blue jacket and glasses. He conferred regularly with his attorney, looking cheerful and engaged.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t put people in jail for their beliefs or the things they say,\u201d said Goldstein, who also called his client\u2019s views \u201crepulsive to most people.\u201d",
      "Russell apparently wasn\u2019t on law enforcement\u2019s radar until police responded to a 2017 double homicide at a Tampa apartment building and found him outside crying, dressed in military fatigues. One of his roommates had killed the other two, officials said.",
      "Police concluded Russell had nothing to do with the deadly shootings. But while detectives investigated, they discovered a stash of highly explosive materials and a cache of neo-Nazi signs, posters, books and flags. Russell was in the Florida National Guard at the time and had attended the University of South Florida.",
      "Investigators said Russell co-founded the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, which is German for \u201catomic weapon.\u201d They found flyers in his possession that said, \u201cDon\u2019t prepare for exams, prepare for a race war.\u201d Russell also kept a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in his room and read books like \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d both reading staples of white supremacist extremists.",
      "Devon Arthurs, who later pleaded guilty to killing his roommates, told detectives he shot them for teasing him about his recent conversion to Islam. He also said it was to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen and claimed Russell had materials in the house \u201cto kill civilians and target locations like power lines, nuclear reactors, and synagogues,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Goldstein also represented Russell in that case, when the attorney argued that possessing explosives didn\u2019t mean Russell intended to use them to cause harm. Goldstein said his client was traumatized by the deaths of his roommates and already suffered from mental health issues. Family members said Russell was just a follower looking for community and trying to please his friends.",
      "Russell ultimately pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials. He was sentenced in 2018 to serve five years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, a federal judge in Tampa expressed explicit concern that Russell could fall in with the wrong crowd behind bars.",
      "Several years later, federal investigators discovered his relationship with Clendaniel.",
      "She and Russell began exchanging letters around 2018 while they were incarcerated in different facilities. They developed a romantic relationship that continued after they were released from prison, court records show.",
      "Clendaniel\u2019s defense attorney argued that her abusive childhood and adolescent struggles with addiction made her acutely vulnerable to the influence of people like Russell and other white supremacists. She spent hours on the phone with a confidential informant, discussing how she would obtain a gun and shoot at five electrical substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, according to prosecutors.",
      "When given a chance to address the court during her sentencing hearing last year, Clendaniel affirmed her racist ideology: \u201cIt\u2019s true, your honor, I do still hold National Socialist beliefs,\u201d she said in September.",
      "But she claimed there was a line she wouldn\u2019t cross by acting on them. She said she was struggling with severe mental and physical health problems when she participated in the plot, including a diagnosis of kidney failure that she believed was terminal.",
      "During Russell\u2019s trial Tuesday, his attorney pointed to Clendaniel\u2019s mental state as evidence she had been desperate enough to carry out the attack. Russell, meanwhile, was \u201cmany miles away\u201d in Orlando with no plans to travel to Maryland and help, Goldstein argued."

Josh Green proposed imposing $300 tickets that police could issue to those who shoot off fireworks and potential class A felony charges and decades in prison for those whose use of fireworks leads to serious injury or death.

      "Lawmakers were expected to consider these measures during the current legislative session ending in May.",
      "Hawaii authorities have said existing laws are difficult to enforce, in part because the evidence is often incinerated when fireworks are lit. Residents are also often reluctant to testify against their neighbors, making cases difficult to prove in court. Police wouldn't need to collect evidence to issue the $300 citations Green proposed and a police officer could serve as a witness.",

      "The Trump administration placed more than 50 senior officials with the U.S. Agency for International Development on leave Monday as many were helping organizations deal with the freeze. USAID's acting head said he was investigating whether the officials were resisting Trump's orders.",
      "U.S. policy for decades has been that aid given abroad pays for itself through greater national security, by stabilizing regions and economies and improving relations with partners.",
      "But many Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers believe much foreign assistance is money that should be spent or saved at home.",
      "For every program, \u201cwe'll expect the State Department to defend, repent, or in some cases, make the case for continuation of their programs,\u201d said Rep. Brian Mast, Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the U.S. freeze doesn't affect vital American support to his military as it fights invading Russian forces. That's mostly true.",
      "The only military aid the State Department is responsible for and thus is covered by the pause is foreign military financing and international military education and training. There are other baskets for U.N. peacekeeping operations and demining programs.",
      "Most of Ukraine\u2019s military aid, however, has come from the Pentagon. That includes a program drawing from existing arms stocks and another called the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to pay for weapons contracts that would not be delivered for a year or more.",
      "Neither of the Defense Department programs is directly affected by the freeze, although U.S. officials say there is nothing in the pipeline either.",
      "But civilian programs vital to Ukraine's war effort do come from the State Department. There's no word of exemptions for them. That includes salary support that the U.S. provides to keep Ukraine\u2019s government running despite the war\u2019s damage to the economy.",
      "That support is important, said Bradley Bowman of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cBut I think if our European allies are reading the political moment in the United States well, they better be moving, I say quickly, to try to pick up most or all of that burden.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has sent stop-work orders to wartime civilian programs it supports in Ukraine.",
      "That includes Veteran Hub, a nonprofit that runs a crisis hotline getting up to 1,300 calls a month from Ukrainian veterans who need social and psychological support.",
      "Getting the stop-work order this weekend, Ivona Kostyna, the nonprofit's leader, realized she could soon lose half of her trained staff of 31.",
      "\"If we had a month, say, warning, even two-week warning, it would have been a lot easier on us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could have managed to somehow secure ourselves for this time. But there just wasn\u2019t any warning.\u201d",
      "Days before the U.S. freeze, Veteran Hub received a call from someone on the verge of hurting themselves, Kostyna said. A hotline staffer texted the person through the night.",
      "\u201cAnd now what we have is a line that isn\u2019t working and basically no answer, which is terrifying for us,\u201d she said.",

      "Zimbabwe is one of the few African countries to achieve a milestone in HIV/AIDS diagnosis, treatment and suppression of viral load. That's thanks in large part to a groundbreaking HIV program created by Republican President George W. Bush, credited with saving more than 20 million lives.",
      "The program \u2014 the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR \u2014 has been targeted by Republican hardliners. Bonzo had yet to hear word of a funding cutoff for her group, Trans Smart Trust, which promotes health services for bisexual and transgender people in a country where discrimination and stigma discourage many to seek treatment.",
      "\u201cEveryone is just confused right now,\u201d Bonzo said.",
      "The 54-year-old has been taking HIV treatment for 23 years thanks to PEPFAR support that made medication affordable.",
      "\u201cI have been religiously taking medicines for over two decades, I am living a normal life again, and suddenly we have to stop,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a death sentence for many people.\u201d",

      "U.S. support helped West Africa recover from years of vicious wars. Money from USAID helped pay for school lunches, supported girls' education, strengthened health systems and helps small farmers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is pausing federal grants and loans starting Tuesday as President Donald Trump's administration begins an across-the-board ideological review of its spending, causing confusion and panic among organizations that rely on Washington for their financial lifeline.",
      "Administration officials said the decision was necessary to ensure that all funding complies with Trump's executive orders, which are intended to undo progressive steps on transgender rights, environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, efforts.",
      "They also said that federal assistance to individuals would not be affected, including Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, student loans and scholarships.",

      "The pause was scheduled to take effect at 5 p.m. ET, just one day after agencies were informed of the decision.",
      "\u201cThe use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\u201d wrote Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "Democrats and independent organizations swiftly criticized the administration, describing its actions as capricious and illegal because Congress had already authorized the money.",

      "Washington is a hub of spending that flows to various departments, local governments, nonprofits and contractors, and the memo has left countless people who are dependent on that money wondering how they will be affected.",

      "SAN DIEGO -- During his first week in office, President Donald Trump signed 10 executive orders on immigration and issued a slew of edicts to carry out promises of mass deportations and border security.",
      "Some actions were felt immediately. Others face legal challenges. Some may take years to happen, if ever, but have generated fear in immigrant communities.",
      "Much of what Trump can do will boil down to money. Congress is expected to consider additional support soon. Trump may use emergency powers to tap the Defense Department, as he did for a border wall in his first term.",
      "Here's a look at how immigration policy has changed so far under Trump and what hasn't happened yet:",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it made an average of 710 immigration arrests daily from Thursday through Monday, up from a daily average of 311 in a 12-month period through September under President Joe Biden. If that rate holds, it would surpass ICE's previous high mark set in the Obama administration, when daily arrests averaged 636 in 2013.",
      "Numbers spiked starting Sunday and included highly publicized operations, including in Atlanta, Dallas and, most prominently, Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration has highlighted participation of other agencies in ICE operations, a departure from Biden. They include the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives \u2014 all part of the Justice Department \u2014 and the Homeland Security Department's Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol.",
      "Emile Bove, the acting deputy attorney general, observed arrests in Chicago on Sunday in a sign of the Justice Department's growing involvement.",
      "Trump expanded arrest priorities to anyone in the country illegally, not just people with criminal convictions, public safety or national security threats and migrants stopped at the border. Still, some said it was business as usual for ICE \u2014 at least so far.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing unique about it,\u201d said Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a research and advocacy group that favors immigration restrictions.",
      "He anticipates more enforcement in next few weeks and believes Congress will approve funding for up to 80,000 beds, about double the current level. ICE needs the space to hold people while any legal proceedings play out and while it arranges deportations.",
      "ICE hasn't said how many people it has deported since Trump took office gain, but the administration has highlighted removal flights, including the use of military planes.",
      "Under Biden, ICE deported more than 270,000 people in a 12-month period that ended in September. That was the highest annual tally in a decade, helped by an increase in deportation flights. The Biden administration did not use military planes.",
      "In an episode that may signal more hardball diplomacy with governments that resist or refuse to take back their citizens, Trump said Sunday that he would raise tariffs 25% on Colombia after President Gustavo Petro refused to let two military planes land with deportees. Trump put the tariffs measures on hold after Petro backed down.",
      "A C-27 military transport plane landed Monday in Guatemala, with 80 deportees in shackles and handcuffs. \u201cIt\u2019s my first attempt of the year and I don\u2019t know if I will try again because it\u2019s hard,\u201d said Jacobo Due\u00f1as, 38, who was arrested Friday on the Texas border.",
      "The Trump administration made it easier for ICE to deport people without appearing before an immigration judge by expanding \u201cexpedited removal\u201d authority nationwide for anyone in the country up to two years. The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the fast-track deportations in court.",
      "The administration ended a policy to avoid arrests at \u201csensitive locations,\u201d including schools, hospitals and places of worship. It said it may deport people who entered the country legally on parole, a presidential authority that Biden used more than any president.",
      "It also threatened to punish \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.",

      "Funding has been confirmed for transport projects, including the East West Rail, and an upgrade on the A428 between Milton Keynes and Cambridge.",

      "Changing infrastructure rules",

      "\"This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead,\" she said.",
      "This will work alongside other major changes set out in the government's upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill.",

      "Manchester United are set to make a decision by the end of the season on whether to redevelop the existing stadium into an 87,000-capacity venue or build a brand-new 100,000-capacity ground.",

      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed,\" adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, which include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Starmer recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too.\"",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets\".",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",

      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",
      "Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.",
      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",

      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",

      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions ever day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work afterall.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",

      "DeepSeek has become the most downloaded free app in the US just a week after it was launched.",
      "Its emergence comes as the US has been warning of a tech race with China, and taking steps to restrict the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",

      "Boeing lost nearly a billion dollars a month in 2024, as it grappled with a safety crisis, quality control issues and a damaging strike.",
      "The aerospace giant lost $11.8bn across the year, its worst result since 2020, when the aviation industry was grounded by the Covid pandemic.",
      "In the three months to the end of December, when strikes were affecting the business, it lost $3.8bn.",

      "Chief executive Kelly Ortberg said the company was focused on what he called the \"fundamental changes\" needed to restore its fortunes and restore trust.",
      "Boeing has had a dreadful year by any measure. In January 2024, a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Investigators said it had not been bolted on properly.",
      "The incident highlighted serious quality control failings at the company \u2013 and at its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. It also reignited concerns about Boeing's attitude towards safety.",

      "The government has made improving growth its main priority in order to boost living standards, but recent figures indicate the economy is struggling to expand.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told company bosses on Tuesday that the government's \"growth mission\" would be the key factor behind policy decisions.",
      "Sir Keir was speaking after he and Chancellor Rachel Reeves met bosses of firms including Tesco, BT and Unilever as part of their efforts to get more investment to the UK.",

      "'Bit of a damp squib'",

      "Many of these pension schemes are closed, so are invested relatively safely in order to ensure they meet their obligations to members, when no extra contributions are coming in.",
      "Pension scheme trustees would need to agree that releasing money will not put members' pensions at danger.",
      "There is no guarantee that companies would use the money to invest - a move that would require confidence in the wider outlook. That would need to happen at scale for economic growth to improve.",
      "Workers might also want the surplus to be used to improve the pension offer made to all staff - including those on more common defined contribution, rather than defined benefit, pensions.",
      "Independent pension consultant John Ralfe said the chancellor was looking for a \"quick win\" in her quest for growth, but doubted the latest proposed reforms would deliver it.",
      "\"The idea that there is a queue of companies waiting to do this is wishful thinking,\" he said, due to most firms looking to offload their pension liabilities altogether to specialist insurance companies.",
      "For those companies that do want to withdraw surpluses , they would need to agree changes with trustees, which would likely be \"long drawn-out process\",\" he added.",
      "\"It will all be a bit of a damp squib,\" Mr Ralfe said.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said workers needed a \"cast iron guarantee\" from the government \" that none of these changes will put peoples pensions at risk, especially smaller pensions\".",
      "\"We also need guarantees that any unlocked funds will go to productive investment - not into shareholders' pockets,\" she added.",
      "The proposals follow plans announced last year by the chancellor to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, based on the model used in  Canada and Australia.",
      "The government has also suggested pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. The idea behind this is that larger funds are cheaper to run and are more able to invest in UK infrastructure projects."

      "DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store over the weekend. By Monday, the new AI chatbot had triggered a massive sell-off of major tech stocks which were in freefall as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Shares of AI chip designer and recent Wall Street darling Nvidia, for example, had plunged by 17% by the time US markets closed on Monday.

      "Some have even seen it as a foregone conclusion that America would dominate the AI race, despite some high-profile warnings from top executives who said the country's advantages should not be taken for granted.",
      "The US may still go on to command the sector, but there is a sense that DeepSeek has shaken some of that swagger.",
      "Trump's words after the Chinese app's sudden emergence in recent days were probably cold comfort to the likes of Altman and Ellison. He called this moment a \"wake-up call\" for the American tech industry, and said finding a way to do cheaper AI is ultimately a \"good thing\".",
      "It is also worth noting that it was not just tech stocks that took a beating on Monday. Energy stocks did too. DeepSeek's arrival on the scene has upended many assumptions we have long held about what it takes to develop AI.",
      "Maybe that nuclear renaissance - including firing up America's Three Mile Island energy plant once again - won't be needed. Maybe it does not take so much capital, compute, and power after all.",

We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",
      "We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.",
      "Cyprus Confidential is an international collaborative investigation launched in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into Cyprus firms which provided corporate and financial services to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime.",

    "title": "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:02:20 GMT",
    "summary": "A Chinese startup has built a low-cost AI model using less technologically advanced chips.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) model called DeepSeek has shot to the top of Apple Store's downloads, stunning investors and sinking some tech stocks.",
      "Its latest version was released on 20 January, quickly impressing AI experts before it got the attention of the entire tech industry - and the world.",
      "US President Donald Trump said it was a \"wake-up call\" for US companies who must focus on \"competing to win\".",
      "What makes DeepSeek so special is the company's claim that it was built at a fraction of the cost of industry-leading models like OpenAI - because it uses fewer advanced chips.",
      "That possibility caused chip-making giant Nvidia to shed almost $600bn (\u00a3482bn) of its market value on Monday - the biggest one-day loss in US history.",
      "DeepSeek also raises questions about Washington's efforts to contain Beijing's push for tech supremacy, given that one of its key restrictions has been a ban on the export of advanced chips to China.",
      "Beijing, however, has doubled down, with President Xi Jinping declaring AI a top priority. And start-ups like DeepSeek are crucial as China pivots from traditional manufacturing such as clothes and furniture to advanced tech - chips, electric vehicles and AI.",
      "So what do we know about DeepSeek?",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "What is artificial intelligence?",
      "AI can, at times, make a computer seem like a person.",
      "A machine uses the technology to learn and solve problems, typically by being trained on massive amounts of information and recognising patterns.",
      "The end result is software that can have conversations like a person or predict people's shopping habits.",
      "In recent years, it has become best known as the tech behind chatbots such as ChatGPT - and DeepSeek - also known as generative AI.",
      "These programs again learn from huge swathes of data, including online text and images, to be able to make new content.",
      "But these tools can create falsehoods and often repeat the biases contained within their training data.",
      "Millions of people use tools such as ChatGPT to help them with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarising text, and answering questions - and others even use them to help with basic coding and studying.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT.",
      "That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate.",
      "It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding.",
      "Like o1, R1 is a \"reasoning\" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating a process similar to how humans reason through problems or ideas. It uses less memory than its rivals, ultimately reducing the cost to perform tasks.",
      "Like many other Chinese AI models - Baidu's Ernie or Doubao by ByteDance - DeepSeek is trained to avoid politically sensitive questions.",
      "When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek did not give any details about the massacre, a taboo topic in China.",
      "It replied: \"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\"",
      "Chinese government censorship is a huge challenge for its AI aspirations internationally. But DeepSeek's base model appears to have been trained via accurate sources while introducing a layer of censorship or withholding certain information via an additional safeguarding layer.",
      "Deepseek says it has been able to do this cheaply - researchers behind it claim it cost $6m (\u00a34.8m) to train, a fraction of the \"over $100m\" alluded to by OpenAI boss Sam Altman when discussing GPT-4.",
      "DeepSeek's founder reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, which have been banned from export to China since September 2022.",
      "Some experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to build such a powerful AI model, by pairing these chips with cheaper, less sophisticated ones.",
      "The same day DeepSeek's AI assistant became the most-downloaded free app on Apple's App Store in the US, it was hit with \"large-scale malicious attacks\", the company said, causing the company to temporary limit registrations.",
      "It was also hit by outages on its website on Monday.",
      "Who is behind DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek was founded in December 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, and released its first AI large language model the following year.",
      "Not much is known about Liang, who graduated from Zhejiang University with degrees in electronic information engineering and computer science. But he now finds himself in the international spotlight.",
      "He was recently seen at a meeting hosted by China's premier Li Qiang, reflecting DeepSeek's growing prominence in the AI industry.",
      "Unlike many American AI entrepreneurs who are from Silicon Valley, Mr Liang also has a background in finance.",
      "He is the CEO of a hedge fund called High-Flyer, which uses AI to analyse financial data to make investment decisons - what is called quantitative trading. In 2019 High-Flyer became the first quant hedge fund in China to raise over 100 billion yuan ($13m).",
      "In a speech he gave that year, Liang said, \"If the US can develop its quantitative trading sector, why not China?\"",
      "In a rare interview last year, he said China's AI sector \"cannot remain a follower forever\".",
      "He went on: \"Often, we say there's a one or two-year gap between Chinese and American AI, but the real gap is between originality and imitation. If this doesn't change, China will always be a follower.\"",
      "Asked why DeepSeek's model surprised so many in Silicon Valley, he said: \"Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower - which is what most Chinese firms are accustomed to.\"",
      "Australia's science minister has raised some doubts over the security of the app.",
      "\"There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management,\" Ed Husic told ABC.",
      "\"I would be very careful about that. These type of issues need to be weighed up carefully.\"",
      "How are US companies like Nvidia hit?",
      "DeepSeek's achievements undercut the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created uncertainty about the future of high-performance chips.",
      "\"DeepSeek has proven that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with limited compute resources,\" says Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research.",
      "\"In contrast, OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, faces scrutiny over its ability to maintain a dominant edge in innovation or justify its massive valuation and expenditures without delivering significant returns.\"",
      "The company's possibly lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world.",
      "Nvidia appears to have been hit the worst as its stock price plunged 17% on Monday before slowly beginning to recover on Tuesday, roughly 4% by midday.",
      "The chip maker had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalisation, but fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday, when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported.",
      "DeepSeek is a privately owned company, which means investors cannot buy shares of stock on any of the major exchanges.",
      "China is celebrating DeepSeek's impact",
      "DeepSeek's rise is a huge boost for the Chinese government, which has been seeking to build tech independent of the West.",
      "While the Communist Party is yet to comment, Chinese state media was eager to note that Silicon Valley and Wall Street giants were \"losing sleep\" over DeepSeek, which was \"overturning\" the US stock market.",
      "\"In China, DeepSeek's advances are being celebrated as a testament to the country's growing technological prowess and self-reliance,\" says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"The company's success is seen as a validation of China's Innovation 2.0, a new era of homegrown technological leadership driven by a younger generation of entrepreneurs.\"",
      "But she also warned that this sentiment may also lead to \"tech isolationism\".",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",

      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason. While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand.",

      "\"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals.",
      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "Trump threat casts ominous shadow over Greenland",
      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:26:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Maxime Chapoutier makes wines that combine French and Australian grapes, a strict no-no in the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Winemaker Maxime Chapoutier would be arrested if he tried to sell two of his newest wines in his native France.",
      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

      "'Real regret'",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC One's Breakfast programme children who had turned up after hearing about the riots had been \"egged on\" by \"adults who were extremist and were really there to do terrible things\".",
      "Many of the children she had spoken to had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt they had acted impulsively.",
      "\"One little boy said, 'I broke windows. The next day, I drove past those windows on the bus and I felt terrible.' There was real regret,\" she said.",
      "The children's commissioner's findings come a week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.",
      "He was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the \"meticulously planned rampage\" in which 10 other people, mostly children, were also stabbed on 29 July last year.",

      "Her report suggested that previous negative interactions and a deep-seated mistrust of the police had fuelled the actions of children, who viewed the riots as an opportunity to retaliate against the police.",
      "Poverty and a lack of opportunities in their communities also formed the background of their involvement, the report said.",
      "Dame Rachel criticised the \"unusually severe and swift\" charges which followed the riots, which she said overlooked children's potential for rehabilitation.",

There is no justification for the violence which they endured last year.",

      "She said she had had a phone since she was 11 years old, describing it as a \"necessity\".",

    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",

      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "In addition to early intervention, he told the BBC that ninja swords should be banned and even suggested domestic knives could be made less dangerous.",
      "\"Not all kitchen knives need to have a point on them, that sounds like a crazy thing to say,\" he adds, \"but you can still cut your food without the point on your knife, which is an innovative way to look at it.\"",
      "A total of 507 children were treated in English hospitals for knife injuries in the 12 months to April 2024, according to the latest figures analysed by the Youth Endowment Fund (YEF).",
      "\"I've got three kids,\" says Elba. \"As a parent, that's always going through your mind.\"",
      "In the documentary, called Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis, the Hollywood star meets a 17-year-old boy at Feltham young offender institution who first began carrying a blade when he was 13.",
      "He grew up in a violent home and had been badly bullied at school for having dandruff.",
      "\"I looked around and saw that the only people who ain't getting bullied are the people who are this certain way,\" the teenager tells Elba, \"so I felt the need to become that person.\"",
      "Asked by Elba how that made him feel, the boy says: \"When I had a knife I felt like I could do anything, like I was a god \u2013 nobody could touch me.",
      "\"It makes you the bad man in the situation. Then push comes to shove and you end up using it.\"",
      "He stabbed someone and was a couple of months into his sentence for grievous bodily harm when Elba met him.",
      "The figures from the YEF, a charity that uses government funding to help prevent children becoming involved in violence, show that knife crime remains a persistent problem for young people.",
      "Elba says that, while the ban on zombie knives implemented last September was \"a massive step in the right direction\", the country is still in a crisis.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said last week, following the sentencing of the teenager who murdered three young girls in Southport, that the government would bring in tougher checks for people trying to buy knives online.",
      "Elba believes more attention needs to be paid to children in their pre and early teens, with disciplinary action like school exclusions, used as an opportunity to intervene in a young person's life.",
      "\"When a young child is excluded, they're more likely to go towards a dark place,\" he says, but adds: \"There are indicators of hope. There are intervention schemes that are really working and that no-one really knows about.\"",

      "He was eventually referred to the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (Cirv), which is operated by West Midlands Police.",
      "They identify teenagers who might commit or become a victim of knife crime and intervene before a stabbing takes place.",
      "They then find education and career opportunities that suit each individual.",
      "They sought out Jayden as there were concerns of him being involved in gang activities and carrying a knife. He had been excluded from school several times and kicked out of his family home.",
      "He was diagnosed with autism and ADHD. Through Cirv, Jayden joined a football academy and now aspires to be a coach.",
      "He has stopped carrying a knife but says the dangers remain.",
      "\"It is still quite normal where I'm from to see someone carrying a blade on them,\" he says. \"I nearly got two pulled out on me this week.\"",
      "He paid tribute to PC Laura Cuthbertson who has mentored him as part of Cirv, though the funding for the scheme runs out in six months.",
      "According to the Ministry of Justice, inmates with the highest rate of reoffending are aged 10-17.",
      "The scheme costs \u00a31,500 per child each year and Elba wants more funding for initiatives like this - that intervene in a child's life before they commit a crime.",

      "Emmanuel Macron stood in front of the masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci as he made the announcement to an audience of dignitaries, with the change to be introduced by 2031 and visitors charged separately to see the painting.",
      "The French president was outlining his New Renaissance project, which will also involve an international competition to design a second entrance to relieve the growing pressure of visitor numbers beneath the famous glass Pyramid.",
      "Tariff changes will also be introduced from next January so non-EU residents - including UK tourists - pay more to visit.",
      "Macron was giving his response to warnings from the Louvre's director Laurence des Cars that the museum was suffering from grave problems of overcrowding and failing infrastructure.",
      "In a letter to the government made public earlier this month, Ms des Cars said the pyramid - which since 1989 has housed the unique access point to the galleries - was \"structurally unable to cope\" with visitor numbers that now reach more than nine million a year.",
      "She also said that \"in the view of everyone, the presentation of the Mona Lisa... is something that needs to be looked at\".",
      "About three-quarters of the museum's 30,000 daily visitors go to see Leonardo da Vinci's painting, but the experience has become an endurance test, with a constant crowd being funnelled through the Salle des Etats and getting on average 50 seconds to observe the picture and take photos.",
      "\"The public... has no way of comprehending the artist's work, which raises questions over our whole mission of public service,\" Ms des Cars said in her letter.",

      "It would, he said, help integrate the museum into the city and \"give it back to the Parisians\".",
      "He added that removing the Mona Lisa from its current position would allow the museum to present it properly,  and make it easier to view other masterpieces, which are \"too often overlooked\", on display in the Salle des Etats.",

      "The battles their characters fight are not too dissimilar to what some of them have had to go through in real life.",
      "Josh Tedeku, who plays Jaheim, attended a private school growing up, so knows what it feels like to \"be in the minority\".",

      "Boarders gave the five leading actors their first major roles and they all tell the BBC they experienced imposter syndrome.",
      "\"It's funny because I am so different to my character,\" says Jodie Campbell, who plays Leah. \"I felt a lot of imposter syndrome at the start of series one because I was working with such talented people.\"",
      "Most of the actors were able to channel their feelings of imposter syndrome into their characters who are navigating how to fit into a school that wasn't built for them.",
      "But Campbell says she wasn't able to do that as her character \"doesn't feel any imposter syndrome\".",
      "\"Leah thinks it's the institution's fault for not welcoming her and she believes she has every right to be there.\"",
      "As the most outspoken of the scholarship students, Leah refuses to conform to the school's traditions and expectations. She finds herself regularly in trouble for challenging authority figures like the headmaster.",
      "'I laugh at ridiculousness of racism'",
      "In the first series, Leah confronts the entrenched racism at St. Gilbert's by challenging the display of a racist painting and Campbell says it was hard to perform scenes that tackled issues of racism and microaggressions.",
      "\"I had to really prepare myself for some scenes,\" she explains. \"I was looking at an offensive painting every day and that was hard but I used that fuel to arm my character\".",
      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",
      "Tedeku says he appreciated having other actors similar to him around so that when things got too much they could \"group together and laugh at how stupid things are\".",
      "\"I actually think racism is funny in that I laugh at how ridiculous it is that you can hate someone so much that you go out of your way to make fun of them or single them out all because of the colour of their skin.\"",
      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",
      "In the new series, the students are pitted against each other as the number of scholarships are to be whittled down from five to three.",
      "Tedeku says he knows what it feels like in real life to be set against his peers.",
      "\"There's a sense in some communities that only one person can get up at a time and we can't all go together, but that mindset needs to change.\"",
      "His co-star Sekou Diaby who plays Toby, agrees and explains that the acting industry \"can be a toxic environment\".",
      "\"Competition is healthy but sometimes it's so aggressive it's as if you're actually fighting each other. It's crazy and backwards to push your peers down.\"",
      "He believes the arts industry in the UK still has a long way to go and is far behind the industry in the US.",
      "\"In America you see more black minority groups working together to achieve something, but in the UK it feels like you're fighting for each other's spot.\"",
      "Diaby adds that it's even harder to break into the industry if you're from a working class background as \"there's a lot of nepotism in the industry\".",
      "\"But being different is also really powerful because your point of view is rarer in the industry so your take on things will be more unique and that's what will make you stand out.\"",

      "At a screening in October, I was struck by the impact Hard Truths had on the audience. Its relatively short 95-minute runtime disguises a film with significant depth and which punches well above its weight.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in December, Jean-Baptiste reflected: \"Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",

    "summary": "A number of tracks that didn't make a big impact when they were first released have now become hits.",
    "story": [
      "When the lists of the most successful songs of 2024 in the charts, streaming and social media were revealed recently, they included the expected big hitters and some evergreen classics. But sprinkled among them was a different type of hit song.",
      "A number of tracks that failed to make a big impact when they were first released, mostly in the 2010s, have since bubbled up and become firm favourites.",
      "The rise of these slow-burning sleeper hits in recent years is \"one of the most fascinating trends right now\", says Stuart Dredge, head of insight at Music Ally.",
      "Here is our guide to the biggest 2010s sleeper hits.",
      "The Night We Met - Lord Huron (2015)",
      "This song only reached number 77 in the UK at the time of release, but was the 60th most popular song in 2024, according to the Official Charts Company's end-of-year list - above Charli XCX's biggest track. It was even higher on Spotify's global end-of-year chart, at 24.",
      "The LA folk-rock group's song first took off after being used in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack in 2018, and with aching lyrics harking back to the start of a relationship, it has since been recycled in various TikTok memes and Molly-Mae Hague's pregnancy announcement video in 2022 (even though it's actually a break-up song). Cosmopolitan put it top of its playlist of Sad Songs to Blast When You're Feeling Hella Moody.",
      "Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood (2012)",
      "This one reached the US top 20 but missed the UK top 40. It has snowballed on social media and is now the seventh most-streamed song in Spotify history, spending more than three years in total in its global daily top 50. The California band say the autumnal theme made it an \"accidental seasonal hit\", and it has also been adopted as a bisexual anthem.",
      "Champagne Coast - Blood Orange (2011)",
      "Champagne Coast didn't chart originally but British singer Dev Hynes' seductive \"come to my bedroom\" refrain was used in TV show Euphoria's soundtrack in 2019, and then the song blew up on TikTok last summer. It was the most popular old song on the platform in 2024 and sixth overall on Billboard's end-of-year TikTok chart. It finally reached the UK top 20 in July.",
      "Evergreen - Richy Mitch & the Coal Miners (2017)",
      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",
      "\"I think that's why listeners really resonate with them, because they're slightly unique and different-sounding.\"",
      "Eight more sleeper hits:",

      "Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017)",
      "Freaks by Surf Curse (2013)",
      "Many of these songs owe their belated success to TikTok, and tracks that take off \"evoke some kind of emotional response\" in the listener, the platform's UK head of music partnerships Toyin Mustapha believes.",
      "\"It's having something that emotionally resonates. That could be a lyric. It could be the way that the instrumental lands.\"",
      "And our relationship with music has changed. When packaging songs with clips on social media, fans are choosing them as soundtracks to evocative moments.",
      "\"It's no longer passive listening,\" Mustapha adds. \"People are really active participants in the culture. And they're active because they are taking this music and essentially reimagining it in their own way.\"",
      "Record labels do try to help back-catalogue songs become sleeper hits, but it normally happens organically thanks to fans, Dredge says.",
      "\"One of the things you can see is it's songs that lend themselves to a feeling or mood. It often is a particular line from the song that is the thing that is picked up on and goes viral,\" he says.",
      "\"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it other than they suddenly feel relevant to someone in a way that other people appreciate.\"",
      "Sometimes, it's simply that a great song didn't get the attention it deserved at the time: \"Part of it is just that a brilliant song can connect with people, no matter how long ago it was made.\""

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The star discusses how she feels about blowing up on TikTok and the trademark honesty in her lyrics.",
    "story": [
      "South London singer Lola Young's unflinchingly honest hit Messy has reached number one in the UK after a two-month climb, and she's been nominated for a Brit Award. Now she's made a breakthrough, this could be her year.",
      "Lola Young jumps into a car, laughing uncontrollably as she flashes a brand new set of shiny gold teeth.",
      "\"I just got grills fitted,\" she explains once she's regained her composure. \"But they're like so intense, so you're rocking with this today, and a lisp.\"",
      "She's been running a few minutes late for the interview and this explains why - so she can finish getting her dental jewellery accessories fitted, with which she seems extremely pleased.",
      "The screen suddenly freezes. The car she's in is somewhere in the US and the reception has cut out.",
      "Young made her US TV debut on Jimmy Fallon's talk show the night before, which followed a whirlwind trip to Australia, and she'll soon set off on a sold-out European tour. She's talking on Zoom as her manager drives her to the next stop on her schedule.",
      "Travelling the world and in high demand, but making time to get a full set of solid gold teeth grills fitted - she's living a proper pop star's life.",
      "And she is now a proper pop star. After several years of almost making it - she sang on the 2021 John Lewis advert, was on the BBC Sound of 2022 list and had glowing reviews for her two albums - Messy has given her a bona fide hit.",
      "The song became inescapable at the end of 2024 and completed its climb to the top of the charts on Friday.",
      "The 24-year-old is the first current British artist to have a UK number one since Chase and Status and Stormzy in August, the youngest to do so since Dave in 2022, and the youngest British woman to score a chart-topper since Dua Lipa in 2017.",
      "Her number one came a day after she was nominated for best pop act at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The response has been amazing and it's been really exciting to see all the love that Messy has been receiving,\" says Young after reconnecting the call.",
      "\"I love the song, it's a song I wrote that's really personal and really important to me. So I'm really happy that it's resonating so much.\"",
      "Messy was released on Young\u2019s second album This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway last May.",
      "Its trajectory was supercharged when superstar US influencers Sofia Richie Grainge and Jake Shane posted a 14-second TikTok clip of themselves dancing to its chorus. Young's song has now been used in 1.3 million videos on the platform - from Kylie Jenner lip-syncing as a dog, to a viral clip of an old woman vaping and holding a pint alongside the caption \"94 and still messy\".",
      "The singer would like to point out that the track's success is not simply down to TikTok, however.",
      "\"That's not necessarily how it blew up. I would like to say that the song was blowing up before TikTok, and it was having its moment elsewhere. A lot of things contributed to the success.",
      "\"The TikTok thing is great. I don't make music for TikTok. I make music for myself and for my fans, but the Sofia Richie thing is just one element of how well it did in every aspect.",
      "\"But yeah, it's been great to see every side of it.\"",
      "Contradictions",
      "The track was indeed starting to gain traction before finding TikTok virality, and has only done so well because it is more than a mere meme.",
      "Its lyrics, about never being good enough for someone whatever you do, have connected deeply with fans. \"I want to be me, is that not allowed?\" she implores.",
      "\"I guess it's because the song speaks to so many people in terms of, I'm talking about the idea that there's two sides of a person, the contradictions,\" Young says.",
      "The song captures how it is \"to basically feel like you're not enough for somebody and also in turn not enough for yourself\".",
      "Amid the craziness of success, there's some relief that she has now reached the next level in her career.",
      "\"I mean, I feel like it's the right time,\" the singer says. \"It's been a minute, but also it does feel like the right time for me.\"",
      "Young has also recently featured on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s well-received album Chromakopia.",
      "Grit and charisma",
      "When it was released, the Observer said Young\u2019s album had \"a winning combination of zingers and vulnerability\", and the Telegraph said it showed \"all of the grit and charisma of a seasoned artist\".",
      "Like Messy, many of her tracks are one-sided conversations - mainly with an unseen, unreasonable and unsuitable man (or woman).",
      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has backed a third runway at London's Heathrow airport as part of a fresh plan to get the UK's sluggish economy growing.",
      "She said Heathrow expansion, which has been delayed for decades over environmental concerns, would \"make Britain the world's best connected place to do business\".",
      "In a wide-ranging speech to business leaders, she also backed expansions at Luton and Gatwick airports, as well as a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge, which she claimed could be \"Europe's Silicon Valley\".",
      "The Conservatives said the biggest barrier to growth was Reeves' \"job destroying Budget\", which had hit businesses with National Insurance increases.",
      "Reeves to deliver speech on economic growth after hinting at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Labour must make economic growth ideas work this time",
      "Reeves claimed in her speech the measures were needed to \"restore economic stability\" and she had \"no alternative\".",
      "But she said she now wanted to go \"further and faster\" to boost economic growth and act with the \"courage\" she said was lacking from previous governments.",
      "The UK is a country of \"huge potential\" but \"for too long, that potential has been held back\", the chancellor said.",
      "Growth has flatlined since Labour took power - but Reeves made it clear that without it, the party's plans to boost living standards and improve public services would not succeed.",
      "She said: \"Low growth is not our destiny, but growth will not come without a fight, without a government willing to take the right decisions now to change our country's future for the better.\"",
      "Other projects announced include a major redevelopment of Old Trafford, the area around a new stadium for Manchester United, and a plan to bring Doncaster/Sheffield airport back into use.",
      "Many of the projects she announced are unlikely to be completed before the next general election.",
      "But Labour is hoping they will send a signal to business and consumers that the government is serious about growth.",
      "She said: \"For too long, politicians have lacked the courage or the strength to confront these challenges.",
      "\"When presented with a choice, they have not prioritised growth. Instead, they have accepted the status quo and they have been the barrier, not the enablers of change.\"",
      "The third runway at Heathrow has yet to receive planning permission and is likely to face fierce opposition from environmental campaigners, as well as some senior Labour figures such as London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan.",
      "But Reeves said she wanted to see a full proposal for expanding the airport by the summer and was determined to see it built.",
      "And she said new powers in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill would cut years off the length periods it has taken to get major infrastructure projects off the ground.",
      "One of the most ambitious schemes involve rail and road links to cut the journey time between Oxford and Cambridge, as well as new reservoirs to address water shortages.",
      "Reeves claimed the new \"growth corridor\" would add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "The government will also review the so-called Green Book rules - guidance issued by the Treasury on how to appraise policies, programmes and projects - which it said have in the past biased infrastructure spending to already fast growing areas, mainly in the south."

      "Heathrow expansion",
      "Reeves confirmed the government is officially backing plans to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport, arguing it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The plans received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but have been stuck in limbo after legal challenges ever since.",
      "She invited Heathrow to submit plans to expand the airport, but promised the government would only sign them off if \"in line with legal environmental and climate objectives\".",

      "There will also be a new Abingdon Reservoir near Oxford.",
      "Changing infrastructure rules",
      "Government guidance on building major projects will be reviewed in order to support investments outside of the wealthy and productive south-east of England, Reeves said.",
      "\"This means that investment in all regions is given a fair hearing by the Treasury that I lead,\" she said.",
      "This will work alongside other major changes set out in the government's upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill.",
      "Redevelopment of Old Trafford",
      "One of the projects to benefit is plans to redevelop Manchester United's Old Trafford football stadium.",
      "Manchester United are set to make a decision by the end of the season on whether to redevelop the existing stadium into an 87,000-capacity venue or build a brand-new 100,000-capacity ground.",
      "The Old Trafford scheme will use public money to move three rail freight terminals blocking the redevelopment.",
      "Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has promised the scheme will build 5,000 homes and create a second \"major football campus\" in the city.",

      "Reeves said \u00a365m will be given to electric vehicle charging company Connected Curb project to extend their network.",
      "Meanwhile \u00a328m equity will be invested in Cornish Metals, which provide the raw material for solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles.",
      "Lower Thames Crossing",
      "Reeves mentioned the new Lower Thames Crossing, the UK's largest road tunnel, which will link Tilbury in Essex and Gravesend in Kent.",
      "The \u00a39bn tunnel under the Thames river will be one of the most expensive infrastructure projects in British history. The government is exploring how to finance it privately."

      "The review was tasked with shaping a new counter-extremism strategy, addressing online and offline threats from Islamist and the far-right alongside a broader spectrum of extremism.",
      "The government's current definition of extremism is the promotion of an ideology based on violence, hatred or intolerance that aims to destroy the rights and freedoms of others or undermine liberal parliamentary democracy.",
      "Leaked sections of the report, published by Policy Exchange, recommend the government's counter-extremism strategy shift focus to \"behaviours of concern\" rather than \"ideologies\".",
      "Behaviours of concern include violence against women, spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories, fascination with gore or involvement in the online subculture called the \"manosphere\" - which promotes misogyny and opposition to feminism.",

      "One senior source said the situation was now \"a mess\" and criticised Cooper for asking internal officials to conduct the review in the first place, rather than commissioning external experts.",

      "In the meantime, the Home Office is conducting a review of how Prevent interacts with other agencies like the NHS and the police when somebody is not seen as suitable for Prevent, but clearly has neurodivergence or mental health difficulties and poses a risk of violent behaviour.",
      "On Sunday the Home Secretary Yvette Cooper wrote in The Times that there is \"a serious problem when cases don't pass the Prevent threshold but still need urgent action and instead just go into a void\".",
      "The government seems to be moving towards a plan that leaves the existing terrorism and extremism structures largely intact, but bolsters how public bodies handle people who have no clear ideology but pose a risk of serious violence due to obsessions with things such as school massacres.",
      "A pilot scheme will launch next month.",
      "Danny Shaw, a former adviser to Cooper, told the BBC's Today programme he had seen a summary of the report and backed one of the recommendations which said \"the counter-extremism function should take an approach based on behaviours that cause harm rather than one based on definition\".",

      "Appearing on the same programme, Nick Aldworth, a former detective chief superintendent in counter terrorism, expressed concern about police resources, adding: \"If you have a definition or legislation that can't easily be policed it is probably not worth doing.\"",
      "The Policy Exchange authors, who released the Home Office findings, said the review \"runs in the wrong direction\".",

      "\"Such threats come overwhelmingly from those with an ideological or political motive, principally Islamism but also far-right and other forms of extremism.\"",

      "Rachel Reeves said ministers must start saying \"yes\" to new projects and go \"further and faster\" to boost the economy.",
      "Her comments come after days of speculation she will confirm government support for expanding Heathrow in a major speech on Wednesday - risking a rift with some Labour MPs who oppose the idea.",
      "On Sunday, Reeves told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand in hand\" but said plans would be set out in due course.",
      "Speaking at a weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Reeves said: \"Kick starting economic growth is this Labour government's number one mission because I do not believe low growth is our destiny.",
      "\"Will that growth come easy? No. There are no easy routes out.",
      "\"Over the past six months as chancellor, my experience is that government has become used to saying 'no'.",

      "Growth at all costs? Why Reeves is in a sudden rush on the economy",

      "On Monday, Miliband told MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee any future airport expansions \"will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets\".",
      "\"That is a legally binding framework,\" he added.",
      "Former shadow climate change secretary Barry Gardiner has signalled his objection to a third runway at Heathrow, warning it would undermine the government's progress toward net zero carbon emissions.",

    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "story": [
      "When Zara Mohammed became the first female leader of one of the largest representative bodies for British Muslims in 2021, she already had a lot on her plate: rising Islamophobia, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a government refusing to engage with the group.",
      "The then 29-year-old could not have imagined three years later, she would be facing one of the biggest challenges of her career - rioting across England and Northern Ireland, often explicitly targeting Muslims, and still no government contact.",
      "The violent unrest, triggered by false rumours that the Southport knife attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, saw bricks hurled at mosques and Islamophobic chants on the streets.",
      "Many Muslims and people of colour felt afraid to leave their homes.",
      "\"It was so visceral. We were watching on our screens: people breaking doors down, stopping cars, attacking taxi drivers, smashing windows, smashing mosques,\" she told the BBC. \"The kind of evil we saw was really terrifying and I felt like, am I even making a difference?\"",
      "As Ms Mohammed ends her time as general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain \u2013 on Saturday, Wajid Akhter was elected as her replacement \u2013 she spoke to the BBC about the difficulties she has faced.",
      "She described an \"unbelievable tidal wave of Islamophobia\" in the UK, which she said was made more difficult to tackle due to the ongoing policy of government non-engagement.",
      "\"It was the Southport riots for us that made it really quite alarming. The justification was there, the urgency, the necessity of engagement was there, British Muslims were under attack, mosques were under attack and the largest umbrella Muslim organisation wasn't being talked to,\" she said.",
      "Strains in the relationship between successive governments and the MCB began over a decade ago. Ties were severed with the MCB in 2009 under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after the group's deputy leader signed a declaration advocating attacks on the Royal Navy if it tried to stop arms for Hamas. Hamas's military wing had been proscribed as a terror group in the UK eight years earlier.",
      "The deputy secretary later resigned and Ms Mohammed said the MCB made clear such actions did not reflect the organisation, leading to a brief period of re-engagement.",
      "However, under consecutive governments, that engagement was broken again. In 2018, when asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government did not engage with MCB as \"too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable\" - claims the MCB vehemently denied at the time.",
      "For Ms Mohammed, there were hopes that engagement would be renewed when Labour entered government last year as she described \"strong\" and \"positive\" relationships with Labour MPs. However, the policy of non-engagement has continued without any explanation.",
      "She said this was having a \"terrible impact\" on communities who \"do not feel Islamophobia is being taken seriously\". \"At least have a conversation about it, but to not say anything and not tell us why? Surely what happened 14 years ago cannot be the justification.",
      "\"What is the issue now? We're not illegal, we're not proscribed. We do not harbour any extremist views. We have a broad-based demographic of British Muslims,\" she added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) confirmed there had been no change to the policy of non-engagement with MCB but did not detail why.",
      "\"All forms of religious and racial hatred have absolutely no place in our society,\" the spokesperson said. \"The government engages regularly with faith communities to help foster strong working relationships and we are exploring a more integrated and cohesive approach to tackling racial and religious hatred, including Islamophobia.\"",
      "Various government departments engage with faith organisations to discuss relevant issues and policy, including on the Covid-19 pandemic and tackling hate crime.",
      "The rise in Islamophobia has personally affected Ms Mohammed, who faces frequent abuse online. She was also the victim of a hate incident on the London Underground by a man who used offensive language.",
      "\"I've definitely got more of a fear of my personal security than I've ever had before,\" she said. \"There's been an onslaught of far-right, thuggish, anti-Islam, quite disgusting, really awful graphic content that's posted on my account.\"",
      "National monitoring group Tell Mama UK recorded 4,971 incidents of anti-Muslim hate in the year after the Hamas attacks on Israel - the highest total in 14 years - with Muslim women particularly vulnerable.",
      "Challenged on whether the MCB had done enough to support communities, particularly without government engagement, Ms Mohammed said the organisation had done \"a lot of community building \" and \"political advocacy\" to address anti-Muslim hate, including interfaith projects, an Islamophobia event in Parliament and a Visit My Mosque initiative.",
      "However, she said this had not changed mainstream narratives around British Muslims. \"There has been such a normalisation of Islamophobic rhetoric without it being challenged or condemned.\"",
      "\"We could say we're making a difference but then what is being seen in national discourse does not seem to translate,\" she added.",
      "'Constantly firefighting'",
      "Ms Mohammed recognised this as part of a broader trend of hostility directed at Muslim politicians and leaders, drawing attention to former Conservative MP Lee Anderson saying \"Islamists\" had \"got control\" of the mayor of London.",
      "Sadiq Khan condemned the remarks as \"pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred\".",
      "As more Muslim professionals and politicians reached new heights, like Humza Yousaf becoming Scottish first minister and Sir Sadiq being knighted, they \"faced disgusting levels of Islamophobia which others have not ever faced\", said Ms Mohammed.",
      "A BBC Woman's Hour interview with Ms Mohammed was also accused of being \"strikingly hostile\" with more than 100 politicians, writers and other prominent figures criticising Ms Mohammed's \"mistreatment\" on the show. The BBC said it promised to \"reflect on\" the concerns raised following the interview.",
      "These ongoing challenges has left Ms Mohammed in two minds about her legacy.",
      "\"You're constantly firefighting. Did we make British Muslims' lives better? On one hand, yes, because we raised these issues, we took them to a national platform. But with Islamophobia, we're still having the same conversation.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 06:30:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says repeated legal action against big projects is preventing the country's growth.",
    "story": [
      "Major infrastructure projects in the East of England have been delayed by lengthy legal challenges, according to the government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to end so-called Nimby - Not in My Back Yard - challenges from those he says stand in the way of the country's growth. But just how disruptive have these challenges been in the East of England, and why have groups campaigned against the projects cited by the government?",
      "What has the government said?",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges against decisions on major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.",
      "His reasoning was to prevent \"cynical\" and \"hopeless\" appeals blocking plans for things such as wind farms, nuclear stations and transport projects.",
      "As part of the announcement, Downing Street referenced Suffolk's Sizewell C nuclear power station, improvement plans for the A47 in Norfolk and wind farm infrastructure in the region that has been hit by campaigners' challenges.",
      "What do these projects entail?",
      "Energy company EDF wants Sizewell C to provide what they claim would be decades of clean, reliable electricity, but it is waiting for a final investment decision, expected this year.",
      "The government previously said new nuclear plants would be needed if the UK wanted to hit its target to decarbonise power generation, and some work has begun on the site in preparation.",
      "In Norfolk, National Highways is undertaking three major upgrades to the A47.",
      "The first scheme began last year on the section of the road between North Tuddenham and Easton, east of Norwich, which will create two additional lanes and two new junctions by 2027.",
      "Finally, the LionLink and Sea Link offshore wind projects in Suffolk are due to see converter stations built at several locations in the county.",
      "National Grid is waiting for permission from the government but has spoken of the wider project's importance.",
      "What campaigns have delayed these projects?",
      "Several groups have taken action against Sizewell C over a number of issues.",
      "Most recently, Theberton and Eastbridge Action Group on Sizewell Limited lost a High Court bid to challenge the Office for Nuclear Regulation's decision to issue a licence for the site.",
      "In December 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed a legal challenge from Together Against Sizewell that argued the government failed to consider the need for a water supply at the site.",
      "The A47 improvement schemes were previously thrown into doubt when a former Green Party councillor attempted to block them.",
      "Andrew Boswell claimed the Department for Transport's development consent orders, approved in 2022, failed in each case to assess the significance of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, as required by law.",
      "However, he lost his case at the High Court and then had a challenge dismissed at the Court of Appeal.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court turned down his application for a legal challenge to be heard there.",
      "National Highways said delays to the three schemes had caused costs to soar due to the impact of inflation.",
      "Offshore4Sure has campaigned against the building of the substations in Suffolk.",
      "It wants developers to find more appropriate sites, but National Grid said this would lead to a delay in greener energy and greater energy security.",
      "It added that there were \"no suitable brownfield sites in east Suffolk\" for the substations.",
      "Have any campaign groups spoken about the government's recent announcement?",
      "Campaign group Stop Sizewell C has been vocal against the nuclear power station for a number of years.",
      "Alison Downes, executive director of the group, said on Thursday that the prime minister's comments suggested people were \"always winning legal challenges\" \u2013 which was \"very far from being the case\".",
      "She felt the decision could \"erode the right\" for people to defend where they live.",
      "\"Sometimes [legal challenges] are the only means left to address fundamental flaws in a project that have not been addressed either by the developers or by ministers,\" she said.",
      "\"It's people most affected by a project who are the ones who take the time and trouble to really read the detail and understand where all the difficulties are that quite often ministers and developers will try to gloss over, and which potentially could lead to very serious problems down the line.\"",
      "What did the energy secretary say?",
      "During a visit to the Port of Lowestoft on Thursday, Energy Security Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC it was \"absolutely right\" for local people to be able to have a judicial review over what the government was doing.",
      "However, he said there was often an \"endless cycle of case after case on the same issue\".",
      "\"I think we were elected to make a different choice as a country, which is [to] listen to local people [and] make sure that local communities get direct benefit if they host clean energy infrastructure, but also to build that infrastructure that is in the interest of the country,\" he added.",
      "What happens next?",
      "The government said it planned to use the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill in March to introduce legislative changes to \"drive action at a strategic level\", providing certainty for developers and the environment.",

      "And if diplomacy is the art of finding shared interests and instincts, particularly if one or the other or both might be in short supply, the way Downing Street and the White House described this first conversation since the inauguration is a case study in just that: diplomacy.",
      "Sources in London describe the call as \"very warm\" and \"very personal\". It appears the big picture, and getting to know each other, was the aim, rather than policy detail.",
      "It is, of course, on the policy detail that disagreements loiter.",
      "But for now at least there appears to be an effort on both sides to establish a rapport and for each to size the other up \u2013 all ahead of a trip to Washington the prime minister is expected to make in the next handful of weeks.",
      "It is convention when two international leaders speak for each side to issue what is known as a \"read out\" afterwards \u2013 how each side interpreted how the call went and what was discussed.",
      "These read outs tend to broadly overlap, otherwise it would appear each side was talking about a different call, but differences of emphasis and language are worth looking for.",
      "As you would expect, they discussed the ceasefire in the Middle East and the release of the British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari.",
      "Also, as you would expect, both sides mentioned the president's love of the Royal Family, a vital and unique diplomatic lever the prime minister has at his disposal in the coming years of managing his relationship with the White House.",
      "There was mention too of the president's condolences to the prime minister over the recent death of his younger brother, Nick.",
      "But two other sentences, one from each read out, struck me most.",
      "First, a sentence from Downing Street.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the two men \"discussed trade and the economy, with the prime minister setting out how we are deregulating to boost growth\".",
      "A counterintuitive thing for a left wing leader to say - talk of deregulation - but a magic word to use in the company of President Trump.",
      "And it is a consistent thing for the prime minister to be saying: both he and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have been emphasising it in various guises over the last few days as they have really leant into their desire for economic growth.",
      "We will hear more about it this week, including in a key speech from Reeves on Wednesday and various other announcements before and after that speech.",
      "Second, a sentence from the White House.",
      "A spokesman there said \"the two leaders also discussed\u2026how both countries can promote a fair bilateral economic relationship\".",
      "No explicit mention of tariffs, or import taxes, but we know they are threatened by President Trump on America's friends as well as foes.",
      "But that sentence, with that reference to \"fair\" appears to be doing a lot of work to smile through what could be some bumpy conversations ahead.",
      "Bumpy, though, is for another day, appears to be the vibe. For now at least.",

    "story": [
      "The closure of Strangers' bar, in the House of Commons, while an alleged spiking incident is investigated has thrown the spotlight on Westminster's drinking culture and what goes on in its many watering holes.",
      "You are certainly never far from a bar in the Palace of Westminster.",
      "For centuries, British politics has floated along on a tide of booze. Drink is part of the fabric of the place, but the drinking dens of Parliament are not what you might imagine.",
      "The bars reserved exclusively for MPs and peers \u2013 in the deeper recesses of the ancient building \u2013 such as the Pugin Room or the Members' Smoking Room (which is now non-smoking) may have the feel of a Mayfair gentlemen's club, all leather armchairs and hushed tones.",
      "But the most popular venue on the estate, The Woolsack, is more like a traditional British pub that you would find in any market square or High Street.",
      "Closing bars could risk MPs' safety, says minister",
      "Westminster drinking culture blamed for bad behaviour",
      "Parliament bar closed after alleged spiking incident",
      "Until 2018, it was called the Sports and Social Club but was rebranded and placed under new management after it gained a reputation for drunken brawls and other misdemeanours.",
      "Slightly shabby and old school, with its wood panelling, trophy cabinets and a carpet that has seen better days, it does a roaring trade with a younger, after-work crowd.",
      "This is where researchers, Parliamentary staff and the occasional MP come to talk shop and catch up with gossip.",
      "It is not easy to find, tucked away in a courtyard between loading bays with no sign outside, adding to the clubby sense of exclusivity that must be part of the attraction.",
      "It's open to passholders with a maximum of two guests and taking pictures or filming is strictly prohibited.",
      "The prices are attractive too. You can get a pint of House of Lords lager for \u00a34.30, for example, a pint of San Miguel for \u00a35.25 or a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc for \u00a35.60.",
      "This is pretty cheap for central London. Similar drinks at pubs within easy walking distance of Parliament, such as the Red Lion, the St Stephen's Tavern or the Marquis of Granby would set you back a bit more (according to our extensive research).",
      "The Parliamentary authorities insist drinks on the estate are not directly subsidised - and are \"benchmarked\" against prices in the outside world.",
      "But the Commons catering department, which oversees 27 bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as banqueting services, was subsidised by taxpayers in 2022/23 to the tune of \u00a36.4m, according to the annual accounts.",
      "Until it was closed, Strangers' bar also did a roaring trade, particularly in the summer months when it serves drinks to thirsty punters on the Commons terrace, enjoying spectacular views of the Thames.",
      "It is smaller and has a more upmarket feel than The Woolsack, but has also seen its share of bad behaviour over the years.",
      "When late night sittings were more common, it would be packed with increasingly inebriated MPs and party whips, trying to keep them in line.",
      "Journalists have traditionally headed to Strangers if they want to a catch a word with an MP.",
      "(The Westminster press pack have their own bar and caf\u00e9, Moncrieff's, named after the late, and legendary, Press Association reporter Chris Moncrieff, but few seem to use it.)",
      "Along the corridor from Strangers, you will find function rooms which are another hub of Westminster's social life, playing host to receptions and events most evenings where the (free) booze flows.",
      "Speaking on condition of anonymity, one member of the catering staff tells me that the excitement can sometimes go to guests' heads.",
      "\"I've never seen anyone throw up. I've seen four or five pass out,\" he says.",
      "The majority of MPs are polite and courteous to the staff, he says, but like most things at Westminster, when there is bad behaviour it tends to divide along party lines.",
      "\"The more pretentious Tory MPs will say 'do you know who I am?'. Labour ones are more like 'do you know how important I am?',\" he laughs.",
      "One thing he has noticed is that the new intake of MPs seem to be a less boozy crowd than their predecessors.",
      "Last July's general election saw an unprecedented clear out of MPs, and many of the 350 new MPs are younger, and more likely to have school age children.",
      "One of the new intake, Liberal Democrat Steff Aquarone, 40, thinks Westminster's bar culture is well past its sell by date.",
      "\"This one of the few remaining places where it's still possible to drink at lunchtime in the workplace. Most of the rest of the world of industry has moved on from that.\"",
      "The North Norfolk MP says this is \"problematic\" because \"it creates all sorts of circumstances where behaviours that are not only undesirable but in some cases wholly toxic end up becoming accepted as the price of socialising\".",
      "Commons leader Lucy Powell argued this week that it was safer for MPs and their staff to drink in Westminster's bars, where they are protected by security guards and codes of conduct, than in ordinary London pubs.",
      "Aquarone says he understands Powell's point but, he argues, some people in Parliament need to be protected from colleagues.",
      "\"If I wanted to go for a drink with my team, I could choose anywhere in London where no one would know who we were and no one would know that we were there and that's actually a far more secure way of having a safe night out.\"",
      "One new Labour MP said with many of the new intake in their 30s with young children, there may be some drinking on a Monday night when there's no vote until 10pm, but MPs are more aware that they shouldn't be drinking with staff.",
      "The terrace provided a good place to get to know new colleagues last summer and were bonding over booze, but the Labour MPs of old who had a pint at lunchtime are gone, they said.",
      "In fact, some new MPs are pushing for Parliament's bars to be closed at lunchtime, or even shut down altogether, as part of a modernisation programme.",
      "This would not go down well with ordinary Parliamentary staff or many of the 14,500 pass holders with access to the pubs and bars on the estate.",
      "\"Parliament is a unique place, it's like a village, why shouldn't we have a bar? It's the Houses of Parliament, not Ibiza,\" one woman, who has worked in Parliament for nearly three decades, tells me.",
      "She is enjoying an after work pint with a friend in the Lords Terrace bar, which has the slightly soulless feel of an airport lounge and tends to attract an older crowd.",
      "They both think the public have got the wrong idea about Westminster drinking \u2013 friends are always disappointed when they get to see what the bars are actually like, they say.",
      "\"It's just a place to relax and have a chat with your pals,\" says the woman, as she drains her pint and pulls on her coat.",
      "It's certainly hard to imagine life at Westminster without pubs and bars, but changing social attitudes are lapping at the gates of its historic drinking dens.",
      "Maybe one day they will call time.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:57:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Years of delay and dispute have worn down support for what was once the government's flagship policy.",
    "story": [
      "After years of delay and dispute, the Scottish government has ripped up its plans for a National Care Service.",
      "The plans have gone from the flagship announcement of the parliamentary term and potentially a cornerstone of Nicola Sturgeon's legacy, to a non-statutory advisory board.",
      "Some \u00a330m was spent in the process, amid a series of consultations, legislative redrafts and political rows.",
      "But when the plans were first announced, there was widespread support for the principle of reforming social care. Many were in favour of the idea of ending a \"postcode lottery\" across different areas.",
      "So what happened to bring the National Care Service crashing to earth?",
      "Has it been scrapped?",
      "To be clear, yes.",
      "It might be a bit confusing, given the government says it remains committed to a National Care Service, and that the bill to set it up is still going through parliament.",
      "But care minister Maree Todd has agreed to remove part one of the bill - the part literally titled \"the National Care Service\".",
      "The vision originally set out by Nicola Sturgeon - of a game-changing network of care boards across the country, a mirror for the NHS - is completely gone.",
      "It had already been hugely diluted, stripped back to a national oversight board, amid concerns over costs and a lack of detail in the plans.",
      "All that's left now is a non-statutory advisory board, and widely-supported proposals to strengthen the rights of people living in care homes, known as \"Anne's law\".",
      "While it will no doubt do important work, the government has almost 300 advisory boards currently active - this is not the game-changing innovation of a National Care Service as it has ever been promised.",
      "Delivery problems",
      "The vision of a groundbreaking new care service began its slow-motion crash into harsh reality when the government started trying to construct a legal framework for it.",
      "The legislation laid before parliament was an \"enabling bill\", which set out the broad idea of a care service but left finer details to be filled in by ministers later.",
      "MSPs reacted with alarm, with almost every committee in the parliament questioning how they could properly scrutinise the plans when there was so little substance attached.",
      "The bill was held up repeatedly due to a lack of firm costings attached to the project, with members demanding that fresh financial memorandums be drawn up.",
      "Money quickly became a problem, and the budget for setting up the scheme - projected as \u00a32.2bn over ten years at one point - became an easy target when ministers needed to make cuts.",
      "That inevitably led to delays, with the target delivery date drifting from 2026 to 2029.",
      "And when the plans were stripped back, it made the legislative process even more complicated, requiring massive amendments to the bill already before parliament.",
      "It made it all the easier for people to call for the government to start over from scratch - or indeed to bin the plans and just channel the funding directly to frontline care instead.",
      "Industry concerns",
      "The government was keen to pursue a \"co-design\" process with those who would be closely involved in the running and use of a National Care Service.",
      "The sheer breadth of groups involved in caring underlines the difficulty of reform - there are councils, health boards, \"integrated joint boards\", health and social care partnerships, independent care providers, staff unions, and more.",
      "While there was support for the principle of improving care services in many quarters, some of these groups had concerns about the plans from the very outset - and others grew increasingly alienated as time went by.",
      "The original vision would have shifted responsibility for staffing and the delivery of care to the new care boards - which councils saw as undermining local control of services.",
      "The redrafted plans would have seen councils keep more of that control under a \"shared accountability\" model, but that too ultimately proved unpopular.",
      "The decision of council leaders to walk away from negotiations in September 2024 was really the moment which signalled the end of the road.",
      "It followed on the heels of unions which represent many carers - including Unison - coming out against the proposals.",
      "Without the support of those at the sharp end of actually delivering care, there was just no way that the NCS could become a reality.",
      "Political spats",
      "The collapse of the care service plans has spanned the reigns of three first ministers, each of whom insisted at some point that they were completely committed to delivering on them.",
      "Politics has undoubtedly played a part.",
      "But when it was first announced, there was not a wave of opposition to the idea of a care service at Holyrood.",
      "Indeed a few of the opposition parties remain in favour of the plans in principle - Labour in particular have just run on a manifesto promising to set one up at a UK level.",
      "But positions hardened as the policy process dragged on and concerns over the lack of detail in the bill mounted.",
      "The final straw came when the Greens withdrew their support in October 2024.",
      "That left the SNP completely isolated, with no clear way of building a coalition to get the bill passed.",
      "The government is actually quite keen to stress that there is no route through parliament for the bill, because it spreads the blame around other parties.",
      "But it is fair to reflect that political opposition has grown over time, in parallel with concerns about the proposals across a much wider base."

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

      "When spent nuclear fuel is separated it into its component parts, one of the products is plutonium.",
      "Successive governments have kept the material to leave open the option to recycle it into new nuclear fuel.",
      "Storing this highly radioactive material - in its current form - is expensive and difficult. It needs to be frequently repackaged, because radiation damages the containers it's kept in. And it's guarded by armed police. All that costs the taxpayer more than \u00a370m per year.",
      "The government has made the decision that the safest - most economically viable solution - is to \"immobilise\" its entire plutonium stockpile.",
      "That means that a facility will be built at Sellafield where the plutonium can be converted into a stable, rock-like material, which can eventually be disposed of deep underground.",
      "In a statement, energy minister Michael Shanks said the objective was \"to put this material beyond reach, into a form which both reduces the long-term safety and security burden during storage and ensures it is suitable for disposal\".",
      "Nuclear materials scientist Dr Lewis Blackburn from the University of Sheffield said the plutonium would be \"converted into a ceramic material\" which, while still radioactive, is solid and stable so it is deemed safe to dispose of.",
      "\"The type of ceramic remains to be decided [and selecting the right material] is the subject of ongoing research.\"",
      "Nuclear waste expert Prof Claire Corkhill from the University of Bristol said the goverment's decision was a \"positive step\".",
      "She told BBC News that it paved the way to removing the cost and hazard of storing plutonium at Sellafield \"by transforming it and locking it away into a solid, durable material that will last for millions of years in a geological disposal facility\".",
      "\"These materials are based on those we find in nature - natural minerals, that we know have contained uranium for billions of years.\"",
      "The government is currently in the early stages of a long technical and political process of choosing a suitable site to build a deep geological facility that will eventually be the destination for all of the country's most hazardous radioactive waste. That facility will not be operational until at least 2050."

      "All three men describe a rapidly changing environment, with glacial retreat visible year-to-year, and volatile levels of sea ice.",
      "Climate change is unlikely to have been behind the birth of A23a because it calved so long ago, before much of the impacts of rising temperatures that we are now seeing.",

      "It is a debate that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, has been at the centre of.",
      "Shortly after the January 6th Capitol riots in 2021, which were fuelled by false claims of a rigged US presidential election, Mr Zuckerberg gave testimony to Congress. The billionaire boasted about Meta's \"industry-leading fact checking program\".",
      "It drew, he pointed out, on 80 \"independent third-party fact checkers\" to curb misinformation on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Four years on, that system is no longer something to brag about.",
      "\"Fact checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they've created, especially in the US,\" Mr Zuckerberg said earlier in January.",
      "Taking their place, he said, would be something totally different: a system inspired by X's \"community notes\", where users rather than experts adjudicate on accuracy.",
      "Many experts and fact checkers questioned Mr Zuckerberg's motives.",
      "\"Mark Zuckerberg was clearly pandering to the incoming administration and to Elon Musk,\" Alexios Mantzarlis, the director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, told the BBC.",
      "Mr Mantzarlis is also deeply critical of the decision to axe fact checkers.",
      "But like many experts, he also makes another point that has perhaps been lost in the firestorm of criticism Meta faces: that, in principle, community-notes-style systems can be part of the solution to misinformation.",
      "Birdwatching",
      "Adopting a fact checking system inspired by an Elon-Musk-owned platform was always going to raise hackles. The world's richest man is regularly accused of using his X account to amplify misinformation and conspiracy theories.",
      "But the system predates his ownership.",
      "\"Birdwatch\", as it was then known, began in 2021 and drew inspiration from Wikipedia, which is written and edited by volunteers.",
      "Like Wikipedia, community notes rely on unpaid contributors to correct misinformation.",
      "Contributors rate corrective notes under false or misleading posts and, over time, some users earn the ability to write them.  According to the platform, this group of contributors is now almost a million strong.",
      "Mr Mantzarlis - who himself once ran a \"crowd-sourced\" fact checking project - argues this type of system potentially allows platforms to \"get more fact checks, more contributions, faster\".",
      "One of the key attractions of community-notes-style systems are their ability to scale: as a platform's userbase grows, so does the pool of volunteer contributors (if you can persuade them to participate).",
      "According to X, community notes produce hundreds of fact checks per day.",
      "By contrast, Facebook's expert fact checkers may manage less than 10 per day, suggests an article by Jonathan Stray of the UC Berkeley Center for Human-Compatible AI and journalist Eve Sneider.",
      "And one study suggests community notes can deliver good quality fact checks: an analysis of 205 notes about Covid found 98% were accurate.",
      "A note appended to a misleading post can also organically cut its viral spread by more than half, X maintains, and research suggests they also increase the chance that the original poster will delete the tweet by 80% .",
      "Keith Coleman, who oversees community notes for X, argues Meta is switching to a more capable fact checking programme.",
      "\"Community notes are already covering a vastly wider range of content than previous systems,\" he told me.",
      "\"That is rarely mentioned. I see stories that say 'Meta ends fact checking program',\" he said.",
      "\"But I think the real story is, 'Meta replaces existing fact checking program with approach that can scale to cover more content, respond faster and is trusted across the political spectrum'.\"",
      "Checking the fact checkers",
      "But of course, Mr Zuckerberg did not simply say community notes were a better system - he actively criticised fact checkers, accusing them of \"bias\".",
      "In doing so, he was echoing a long-held belief among US conservatives that Big Tech is censoring their views.",
      "Others argue fact checking will inevitably censor controversial views.",
      "Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch - which ran a campaign against alleged censorship of David Davis MP by YouTube - told the BBC allegations of Big Tech bias have come from across the political spectrum.",
      "Centralised fact checking by platforms risks \"stifling valuable reporting on controversial content\", she told the BBC, and also leads users to wrongly believe that all the posts they are reading are the \"vetted truth\".",
      "But Baybars Orsek, the managing director of Logically Facts, which supplies fact checking services to Meta in the UK, argues professional fact checkers can target the most dangerous misinformation and identify emerging \"harmful narratives\".",
      "Community-driven systems alone lack the \"consistency, objectivity and expertise\" to address the most harmful misinformation, he wrote.",
      "Professional fact checkers, and many experts and researchers, strongly dispute claims of bias. Some argue fact checkers simply lost the trust of many conservatives.",
      "A trust Mr Mantzarlis claims was deliberately undermined.",
      "\"Fact checkers started becoming arbiters of truth in a substantial way that upset politically-motivated partisans and people in power and suddenly, weaponised attacks were on them,\" he said.",
      "Trust in the algorithm",
      "The solution that X uses in an attempt to keep community notes trusted across the political spectrum is to take a key part of the process out of human hands, relying instead on an algorithm.",
      "The algorithm is used to select which notes are shown, and also to ensure they are found helpful by a range of users.",
      "In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other.",
      "The result, it argues, is that notes are viewed positively across the political spectrum. This is confirmed, according to X, by regular internal testing. Some independent research also backs up that view.",
      "Meta says its community notes system will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings, \"just like they do on X\".",
      "But this wide acceptance is a high bar to reach.",
      "Research indicates that more than 90% of proposed community notes are never used.",
      "This means accurate notes may go unused.",
      "But according to X, showing more notes would undermine the aim of displaying only notes that will be found helpful by the most users and this would reduce trust in the system.",
      "'More bad stuff'",
      "Even after the fact checkers are gone, Meta will still employ thousands of moderators who remove millions of pieces of content every day, like graphic violence and child sexual exploitation material, which break the platform's rules.",

      "The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.",
      "Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (\u00a3400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US.",
      "President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it \"the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\" that would help keep \"the future of technology\" in the US.",
      "DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.",
      "But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.",
      "The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.",
      "DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",
      "It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.",
      "After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of \"performance on par with\" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning.",
      "Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as \"AI's Sputnik moment\", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.",
      "At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement.",
      "DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US.",
      "In the US, AI chipmaker Nvidia ended Monday's trading having plunged 16.9% while its rival Broadcom slumped 17.4%.",
      "Other tech firms also sank, with Microsoft down 2.14% and Google's owner Alphabet down over 4%.",
      "In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth.",
      "\"This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.",
      "\"So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.\"",
      "Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could \"potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain\".",
      "But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development.",
      "\"We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,\" analysts said in a report.",
      "Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack.",
      "\"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support.\"",
      "Who founded DeepSeek?",
      "The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.",
      "The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.",
      "He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China.",
      "Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import.",
      "Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang.",
      "In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model.",
      "\"We didn't expect pricing to be such a sensitive issue,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the summer of 2024. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The founders of important open source software are getting older, who will take over?",
    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions ever day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work afterall.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

      "Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - denies having any knowledge of or being personally responsible for any unpaid tax.",
      "Joe Powell, a Labour MP who leads a Parliamentary group on fair taxation, called on HM Revenue and Customs to \"urgently\" investigate the case to recover what could be \"very significant amounts of money that could be invested in public services\".",
      "At the heart of the scheme was Eugene Shvidler, a former Chelsea FC director and a billionaire businessman in his own right, who is currently challenging the UK government's decision to sanction him for his close links to Mr Abramovich.",
      "Mr Shvidler moved to the USA after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but from 2004 until 2022 he lived in the UK, with properties in London and Surrey.",
      "A tax expert told the BBC that evidence Mr Shvidler had been making strategic decisions on the investments while based in the UK, and not in the BVI, was \"a pretty big smoking gun\", suggesting the companies should have been paying UK tax.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Shvidler said the BBC was basing its reporting on \"confidential business documents that present an incomplete picture\" and had \"drawn strong and erroneous conclusions as to Mr Shvidler's conduct\".",
      "They said \"the structure of investments\" was \"the subject of very careful and detailed tax planning, undertaken and advised on by leading tax advisors\".",
      "The scheme involving Mr Abramovich's hedge fund investments was revealed in a huge leak of data that the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have been examining for over a year - thousands of files and emails from a Cyprus-based company that administered Mr Abramovich's global empire.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including The Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. On Tuesday, we revealed how Mr Abramovich had dodged millions in VAT on the running costs of his yacht fleet.",
      "The leaked data shows how Mr Abramovich invested a large part of the wealth he acquired in the 1990s through a corrupt deal - ploughing it into a company in the BVI called Keygrove Holdings Ltd.",
      "A network of British Virgin Islands companies owned by Keygrove invested this money - up to $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) between the late 1990s and early 2020s - into Western hedge funds, according to the leaked files.",
      "These investments made the oligarch an estimated $3.8bn (\u00a33.1bn) in profits over almost two decades. By making the investments through companies in the BVI, which does not levy tax on corporate profits, the scheme appears to be set up to ensure as little tax as possible was paid.",
      "'Full power to do anything'",
      "It is not unusual for businesses to legally avoid paying tax on their profits by making their investments from companies in tax havens. But the companies involved must be managed and controlled offshore where they are incorporated.",
      "If an offshore company's strategic decisions are being taken by someone in the UK, its profits could be taxed as if it were a UK company.",
      "The leaked documents show how the directors of the BVI investment companies handed sweeping powers over them to Mr Shvidler, who was living in the UK and gained British citizenship in 2010.",
      "The BBC has seen \"general power of attorney\" documents dated between 2004 and 2008, that gave him the \"broadest possible powers\" and \"full power to do everything and anything\" to investment companies in the BVI.",
      "From 2008, Mr Shvidler appears to have acquired the power to direct the investments of Keygrove, which owned the BVI companies, through another company.",
      "Millennium Capital Ventures Ltd, which was owned indirectly by Mr Shvidler's wife and appointed him as a director in 2000, became Keygrove's investment manager. It was assigned \"full power and authority to supervise and direct\" the investment of the assets, \"all without prior consultation with client\".",
      "'Strong evidence'",
      "Further evidence of Mr Shvidler's crucial role in the investment decisions of the BVI companies emerged in a court case brought in September 2023 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a New York firm called Concord Management.",
      "The SEC filing says that Concord had only one client, since identified as Mr Abramovich. The company advised on investment decisions for the oligarch's BVI companies.",
      "It identifies a \"longtime close associate\" of Mr Abramovich, referred to as \"Person B\", who \"made investment decisions\" for Mr Abramovich.",
      "It says he was \"the point of contact for receiving investment advice\" and \"for either deciding or communicating the decision whether to go forward with recommended transactions\".",
      "Using the leaked documents, the BBC was able to identify \"Person B\" as Eugene Shvidler.",
      "The evidence suggests Mr Shvidler was making the decisions described by the SEC, managing and controlling Mr Abramovich's investments, from the UK rather than the BVI.",
      "Tax expert Rita de le Feria told the BBC that evidence a UK resident, such as Mr Shvidler, was taking \"strategic big decisions\" on the hedge fund investments was a \"clear indication\" the huge profits should have been taxed by the UK.",
      "\"I think this is a pretty big smoking gun. That would be, again, strong evidence that the effective management of the company was not taking place in the BVI,\" she said.",
      "Mr Shvidler's lawyers said there can be \"no question of Mr Shvidler, either knowingly or negligently, being involved in an unlawful scheme to avoid paying tax\".",
      "Lawyers for Mr Abramovich said that in addition to the advice he obtained over his tax affairs, he \"expects that similar advice was sought\" by those with responsibility for running companies related to him.",
      "The leaked documents also reveal how large amounts of the untaxed profits from Mr Abramovich's hedge fund investments passed through a network of the oligarch's companies before flowing into Chelsea FC.",
      "The hedge fund investments flowed back into his companies in the BVI and then into Keygrove, their parent company.",
      "Keygrove then loaned out money to other companies in Mr Abramovich's network, which in turn lent money to Camberley International Investments Ltd - a company set up to bankroll Chelsea FC.",
      "By 2021, when Chelsea won the Champions League, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to the club could be traced back to companies benefiting from Mr Abramovich's untaxed hedge fund investments.",
      "How we calculated the bill",
      "If HMRC were to investigate, how much could Mr Abramovich or the companies concerned owe?",
      "We have assessed the profits made by the investment companies in the BVI from 1999 to 2018.",
      "The leaked documents only contain complete accounts for the companies investing in hedge funds from 2013 to 2018.",
      "But we can estimate how much money the companies involved were likely to have made over the entire period by looking at their \"revenue reserves\". These are profits kept in the businesses, rather than being paid out to shareholders. By the end of 2018 this amounted to $3.8bn.",
      "Applying historical UK corporation tax and currency conversion rates to the revenue reserves up to 2012, and the yearly profits to 2018, amounts to a potential tax bill of more than \u00a3500m owed to HMRC.",
      "But in the event of an enquiry into unpaid tax, HMRC can also impose late payment interest and penalties for failure to notify the authorities.",
      "If tax has gone unpaid, then depending on whether an investigation concluded those responsible knew but did not tell HMRC, or whether they did not know, the total amount due could range from almost \u00a3700m to over \u00a31bn.",
      "There is a possibility that some tax on the profits could not be recovered, as HMRC investigations can only go back a maximum of 20 years.",
      "However, our calculations are also likely to be an underestimate, because we have applied the lowest rate of corporation tax that existed between 1999 and 2012, and it is possible profits had been extracted from the companies in that period that we have not included in our sums.",
      "In any event, Mr Abramovich's tax bill could dwarf the \u00a3653m bill imposed on Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2023.",
      "Frozen funds",
      "Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the British government allowed Roman Abramovich to sell Chelsea FC to Todd Boehly. It did so on the condition that \u00a32.5bn from the proceeds would be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Nearly three years later, the money still sits in a frozen Barclays bank account, reportedly due to disagreement over how it should be spent, with Mr Abramovich wanting the money to go to \"all the victims\" of the war, and the UK government insisting it should be spent solely on humanitarian aid in Ukraine.",
      "The BBC's investigation suggests that, just as Ukrainians are waiting for money from the former Chelsea boss, so is the British taxpayer.",
      "Cyprus Confidential is international collaborative investigation launched in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into Cyprus firms provided corporate and financial services to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime.",

    "story": [
      "The Doomsday Clock symbolising how near humanity is to destruction has been moved one second forward to 89 seconds to midnight - the closest it has ever been.",
      "The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) - which sets the clock annually - said nuclear threats, potential misuses of advances in biology and artificial intelligence, as well as climate change, were the key factors.",
      "Daniel Holz, chair of the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, said the latest move was \"a warning to all world leaders\".",
      "The clock was originally placed at seven minutes to midnight in 1947. Last year, it was left unchanged at 90 seconds.",
      "In Tuesday's statement, the BAS - a Chicago-based non-profit organisation - said: \"In setting the clock one second closer to midnight, we send a stark signal.",
      "\"Because the world is already perilously close to the precipice, a move of even a single second should be taken as an indication of extreme danger and an unmistakable warning that every second of delay in reversing course increases the probability of global disaster.\"",

      "Mr Najim was arrested in Italy on 21 January and unexpectedly freed days later \"due to a legal technicality\", the interior ministry said.",
      "The ICC, which said it had not been consulted, swiftly issued another arrest warrant for Mr Najim and demanded an explanation from the Italian authorities.",
      "In the video, Meloni said the Rome appeals court released Mr Najim because the ICC warrant had not been sent to the Italian justice ministry.",

    "title": "Abramovich dodged millions in tax with superyachts-for-hire scheme",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 06:00:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Shell companies were used to charter the sanctioned oligarch\u2019s yachts to himself, evading VAT, BBC reveals.",
    "story": [
      "It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.",
      "And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.",
      "Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.",
      "The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.",
      "\"There has been tax evasion,\" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. \"This is criminal.\"",
      "In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance\" with it.",
      "The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.",
      "Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (\u00a3559m).",
      "The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.",
      "They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",
      "We do not know if the sum was paid - the company failed to attend its own appeal in March 2024 and was dissolved four months later.",
      "Cyprus Confidential is an international collaborative investigation launched in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into Cyprus firms which provided corporate and financial services to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime.",

      "The meeting comes as an initial six-week ceasefire is being observed in Gaza after a deal was struck between Israel and Hamas to halt the war.",
      "Trump claimed credit for getting the ceasefire and hostage release deal over the line when it was first announced, saying on Truth Social the \"epic\" agreement was possible only because he won November's presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic has resigned, following nationwide protests over the deadly collapse of a railway station canopy.",
      "He said he had acted \"to avoid further complicating things\" and so as to \"not further raise tensions in society\".",
      "Fifteen people died in November when a concrete canopy at a railway station collapsed in the city of Novi Sad. Tens of thousands of people have been regularly taking to the streets since then, demanding accountability for the collapse and protesting against corruption.",
      "In a TV address late on Tuesday, President Aleksandar Vucic said he would decide within the next 10 days on whether to hold parliamentary elections or form a new government.",
      "More than a dozen people have been charged in connection with the Novi Sad incident, including former Transport Minister Goran Vesic - who resigned days after it happened.",
      "Students have taken the lead with the protests, halting traffic daily and blockading universities for months.",
      "Last Friday, many Serbians stayed off work in response to a call for a general strike, while in December an estimated 100,000 people attended a demonstration in Belgrade. Many smaller protests have been held in towns and cities across the country.",
      "Tensions rose on Monday when, during a 24-hour blockade of the busiest road junction in the capital, Belgrade, supporters of the governing Progressive Party attacked and injured a female student in Serbia's second city, Novi Sad.",
      "That evening, President Vucic said he would pardon students and university tutors who faced charges in connection with the protests and announced a major government reshuffle, saying he expected more than half of ministers to be replaced.",
      "Vucic also condemned the attackers, saying: \"We cannot accept that after calling for dialogue and complete peace, anyone in our name violates that. The guys who did that did enormous damage to the state, the party, and each of us.\"",
      "In his Tuesday's address after an emergency meeting with the government, the president said he would sign pardons for 13 people on Wednesday.",
      "He insisted that he and the government had now met student protesters' demands for transparency about the reconstruction of Novi Sad railway station.",
      "Opposition parties have been calling for a transitional government which they say could create the conditions for free and fair elections. But Vucic rejected those demands, saying Serbians \"want normal people in power, not politicians who have no trust\".",

      "But it may also pave the way for parliamentary elections, if a new prime minister is not appointed within 30 days of the National Assembly confirming the resignation.",
      "Vucic has also been pushing the idea of an \"advisory referendum\" on his own role, saying that he would stand down if he lost that vote.",
      "However, a change in power currently seems unlikely.",

The exact circumstances of what is going on is unclear as phone lines are down and electricity and water supplies have been cut off. But the M23 seem to have captured most, if not all, of the city.",
      "\"There was no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23,\" said UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, though he added that it was it was difficult to tell the exact numbers on the ground in Goma.",
      "Tellingly some Congolese army soldiers in Goma who surrendered on Monday, did so by crossing over the border into Rwanda.",
      "Since the conflict begun, President Kagame has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the M23 rebels, who are well equipped, well armed and well trained.",
      "However, this response has noticeably shifted as accusations continue to grow with \"overwhelming evidence\" showing Rwanda's support for the rebel group, according to Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group's project director for the Great Lakes",
      "\"The tone has changed to justification for defensive measures,\" he told the BBC. \"It has become harder to deny Rwanda's support for M23.\"",
      "On Sunday, Rwanda's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"This fighting close to the Rwandan border continues to present a serious threat to Rwanda's security and territorial integrity, and necessitates Rwanda's sustained defensive posture.\"",
      "It said it was concerned by \"misguided or manipulative\" statements that lacked context about the conflict.",
      "For Kagame, the context all comes down to the Rwandan genocide that took place over 100 days in 1994.",
      "The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).",
      "This rebel group is still active in the notoriously unstable eastern DR Congo - and still includes some of those responsible for the genocide.",
      "Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this \"genocidal militia\" as an existential threat.",
      "His government has twice invaded DR Congo, saying it wants to stop Hutu rebel groups from staging cross-border attacks.",
      "Earlier this month he called out his Congolese counterpart, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, for failing to deal with the FDLR and talk to the M23, saying this was exacerbating the conflict.",
      "Mr Moncrief believes that the targeting of Goma is more about making a political point as he says the M23 does not need the city strategically as it already \"controls many more lucrative areas\".",
      "\"It is President Kagame's way of exerting power over who is in charge of North Kivu,\" said the Great Lakes expert.",
      "Rwanda accused the military governor of North Kivu, who was killed in fighting last week, of collaborating with the FDLR.",
      "The discovery of this kind of high-level collaboration, experts agree, would have been like a red flag to a bull for Rwanda.",
      "The M23's origins are tied to these tensions - it is the latest incarnation of a rebel group that says it is fighting for the interests of the minority Tutsi community in eastern DR Congo.",
      "Its first uprising more than a decade ago ended with a peace deal - when its fighters disarmed and mainly moved into camps in Uganda.",
      "But three years ago, they began leaving the camps saying the deal was not honoured and within a couple months was seizing territory.",
      "The UN peacekeeping mission - first deployed in 1999 - is not mandated to go on the offensive. Two regional forces - an East African one followed by a southern African one - specially deployed over the last few years at the request of Tshisekedi have failed to contain the M23.",
      "This gives an indication of the M23's sophisticated operations.",
      "According to the UN group of experts, this includes five months of training at the M23's main base in Tchanzu, hilly terrain not far from Rwanda's border, that incorporates courses on theory and ideology and then practical elements including \"war tactics\", \"engagement rules'' and \"bush tactics\".",
      "It said Rwandan officers were often at the camp, where recruits, including children, were brought - some joining up on a voluntary basis, others forced to do so in a systematic operation where local chiefs had to provide conscripts.",
      "The experts said Sultani Makenga, who once fought for Kagame in the early 1990s in Rwanda and is now the M23's military chief, attended some of the passing-out ceremonies between 25 September and 31 October 2024 that involved 3,000 recruits.",
      "Rwanda's spokesperson Yolande Makolo did not address the question of whether Rwandan officers were in the M23 camp but she did deny the charges about child soldiers, telling the BBC last year: \"The claim about recruiting minors in camps is absurd, it's blatant information warfare against Rwanda.\"",
      "However UN expert reports detail how the M23's strength has grown since May when numbers were put at around 3,000.",
      "The experts estimate that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan army troops are on the ground in DR Congo - saying it based this on authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimonies and intelligence.",
      "Captured M23 fighters said that the Rwandans were known as the \"Friendly Force\", with the experts' December report saying the English term was \"generically used\" even when interviewees were speaking in other languages.",
      "They said these Rwandan special forces were there to train and support the rebels, and they did not interact with M23 regulars.",
      "Rwanda's ally Uganda, unhappy about another rebel group in DR Congo that threatens its security, has also been accused of helping the M23 - with its officers also spotted at Tchanzu. The UN experts say Uganda has also supplied weapons, hosted rebel leaders and allowed cross-border movements of M23 fighters - accusations Kampala denies.",
      "Kagame recently expressed his frustration that after Tshisekedi came to power in 2019, his suggestion that Rwanda work alongside the Congolese army to tackle the FDLR had been rebuffed - unlike a joint offensive by DR Congo and Uganda against the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels.",
      "This may explain the re-emergence of the M23 in 2021 - with evidence showing Rwanda's backing of the group continues to grow.",
      "Cl\u00e9mentine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that geolocated images placed Rwandan troops in Sake, a town just outside Goma last week.",
      "The UN experts say the M23's decision to capture the mining town of Rubaya, which fell to its forces in May, was \"motivated by a strategic need to monopolise\" the lucrative trade in coltan, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.",
      "Its December report says the group now collects at least $800,000 (\u00a3643,000) a month from the taxation of coltan in Rubaya - and ensures that around 120 tonnes of the coveted mineral is sent directly to Rwanda every four weeks.",
      "It includes satellite images to show how a road was widened by September on the Congolese side of the Kibumba border crossing to allow access for heavy trucks that were previously unable to use the route into Rwanda.",
      "Ms De Montjoye explained how the advanced weapons being used by the M23 were not available to any other of the numerous armed groups operating in eastern DR Congo.",
      "\"Earlier last year, we documented how Rwandan forces, and M23 had fired 122mm rockets, hitting displacement camps,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It's certainly with the kind of military support that the M23 has received that they've been able to make such an advance [on Goma].\"",
      "The UN experts have documented many such examples, including the use of Israeli-made anti-tank guided missiles.",
      "Mr Moncrief said the M23 was also using technology to interfere with Global Positioning System (GPS) that had stopped the Congolese army from flying drones it had acquired from China.",
      "The UN experts said the \"spoofing and jamming\" near areas controlled by M23 and the Rwandan army had also disrupted other aircraft.",
      "President Kagame has dismissed these UN reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\" and saying they ignore many outrages committed in DR Congo to focus on \"imaginary problems\" created by the M23.",
      "The East African Community \u2013 currently headed by Kenya's president - is now trying to mediate, though Tshisekedi has said he will not attend a hastily organised emergency summit.",
      "Observers say Rwanda's president will be telling any mediator that the FDLR is the only subject up for discussion as he is adamant their presence makes DR Congo an unsafe neighbour - something he reiterated at a press conference earlier this month.",
      "\"Honestly, for the last 30 years if anyone wanted to understand what the problems are [in DR Congo] and what solutions should be, you don't even need to be an expert,\" Kagame said.",

      "For a while, Beijing seemed to fumble with its answer to ChatGPT, which is not available in China.",
      "Unimpressed users mocked Ernie, the chatbot by search engine giant Baidu. Then came versions by tech firms Tencent and ByteDance, which were dismissed as followers of ChatGPT - but not as good.",
      "Washington was confident that it was ahead and wanted to keep it that way. So the Biden administration ramped up restrictions banning the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "That's why DeepSeek's launch has astonished Silicon Valley and the world. The firm says its powerful model is far cheaper than the billions US firms have spent on AI.",
      "So how did a little-known company - whose founder is being hailed on Chinese social media as an \"AI hero\" - pull this off?",

      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Watch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China",
      "The challenge",
      "When the US barred the world's leading chip-makers such as Nvidia from selling advanced tech to China, it was certainly a blow.",
      "Those chips are essential for building powerful AI models that can perform a range of human tasks, from answering basic queries to solving complex maths problems.",
      "DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng described the chip ban as their \"main challenge\" in interviews with local media.",
      "Long before the ban, DeepSeek acquired a \"substantial stockpile\" of Nvidia A100 chips - estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 - according to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "Leading AI models in the West use an estimated 16,000 specialised chips. But DeepSeek says it trained its AI model using 2,000 such chips, and thousands of lower-grade chips - which is what makes its product cheaper.",
      "Some, including US tech billionaire Elon Musk, have questioned this claim, arguing the company cannot reveal how many advanced chips it really used given the restrictions.",
      "But experts say Washington's ban brought both challenges and opportunities to the Chinese AI industry.",
      "It has \"forced Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate\" so they can do more with less, says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"While these restrictions pose challenges, they have also spurred creativity and resilience, aligning with China's broader policy goals of achieving technological independence.\"",
      "The world's second-largest economy has invested heavily in big tech - from the batteries that power electric vehicles and solar panels, to AI.",
      "Turning China into a tech superpower has long been President Xi Jinping's ambition, so Washington's restrictions were also a challenge that Beijing took on.",
      "The release of DeepSeek's new model on 20 January, when Donald Trump was sworn in as US president, was deliberate, according to Gregory C Allen, an AI expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The timing and the way it's being messaged - that's exactly what the Chinese government wants everybody to think - that export controls don't work and that America is not the global leader in AI,\" says Mr Allen, former director of strategy and policy at the US Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.",
      "In recent years the Chinese government has nurtured AI talent, offering scholarships and research grants, and encouraging partnerships between universities and industry.",
      "The National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning and other state-backed initiatives have helped train thousands of AI specialists, according to Ms Zhang.",

      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "BBC's AI correspondent explains why DeepSeek has caused shockwaves",
      "The talent",
      "Take DeepSeek's team for instance - Chinese media says it comprises fewer than 140 people, most of whom are what the internet has proudly declared as \"home-grown talent\" from elite Chinese universities.",

      "\"Having grown up during China's rapid technological ascent, they are deeply motivated by a drive for self-reliance in innovation,\" she adds.",
      "Deepseek's founder Liang Wenfeng is an example of this - the 40-year-old studied AI at the prestigious Zhejiang University. In an article on the tech outlet 36Kr, people familiar with him say he is \"more like a geek rather than a boss\".",
      "And Chinese media describe him as a \"technical idealist\" - he insists on keeping DeepSeek as an open-source platform. In fact experts also believe a thriving open-source culture has allowed young start-ups to pool resources and advance faster.",
      "Unlike bigger Chinese tech firms, DeepSeek prioritised research, which has allowed for more experimenting, according to experts and people who worked at the company.",
      "\"The Top 50 talents in this field might not be in China, but we can build people like that here,\" Mr Liang said in an interview with 36Kr.",
      "But experts wonder how much further DeepSeek can go. Ms Zhang says that \"new US restrictions may limit access to American user data, potentially impacting how Chinese models like DeepSeek can go global\".",
      "And others say the US still has a huge advantage, such as, in Mr Allen's words,  \"their enormous quantity of computing resources\" - and it's also unclear how DeepSeek will continue using advanced chips to keep improving the model.",
      "But for now, DeepSeek is enjoying its moment in the sun, given that most people in China had never heard of it until this weekend.",
      "The new AI heroes",
      "His sudden fame has seen Mr Liang become a sensation on China's social media, where he is being applauded as one of the \"three AI heroes\" from southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.",

      "\"People call it 'the glory of made-in-China', and say it shocked Silicon Valley, so I downloaded it to see how good it is.\"",
      "She asked it for \"four pillars of [her] destiny\", or ba-zi - like a personalised horoscope that is based on the date and time of birth.",

      "\"Every evening when I came home from work, I would take Adam for a walk,\" says Serhiy. \"He was very curious about the sky. He'd point his little finger up, and we'd tell him about it. And he loved birds.\"",
      "Another family video shows Adam hoisted in Sophiia's arms, being swung from side to side, and then running around on the ground, surrounded by pigeons. \"He had almost started talking,\" Yuliia says, \"and he was always smiling. He was healthy, beautiful and smart. He and my daughter made us happy every day\".",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Yuliia had taken Sophiia to safety in the UK.",
      "The young woman put her language skills to use, working as a translator for Ukrainian troops being trained by the British military, but she could not stay away from Ukraine.",
      "\"She really missed her parents and her relatives and the country,\" Yuliia says. Sophiia returned and later gave birth to Adam in June 2023.  She also took up psychology because \"she knew a lot of people in Ukraine needed psychological help,\" her mother says.",
      "In the midst of her grief, Yuliia knows that Ukraine may soon come under pressure to negotiate with the enemy that robbed her of so much.",
      "President Trump is back into the White House \u2013 all guns blazing -  pushing for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. But both Yuliia and Serhiy are adamant that Ukraine must fight on. She tells me Donald Trump's claim that he could end the war in a day was \"funny to hear\".",
      "\"Russia is an aggressor, that came to our country, and destroyed our homes, and our families,\" Yuliia says. \"So, there can be no talk of any ceasefire or peace talks. If we leave this glutton [Russian President Vladimir Putin] with our territories and do not avenge the people we lost, we will never win.\"",
      "Serhiy says the only contact with Russians on Ukrainian territory should be through combat.",
      "Many Ukrainians believe that even if there is a ceasefire, Russia will come back for more sooner or later \u2013 as it did in 2022, eight years after annexing the Crimean Peninsula. Moscow now controls almost one fifth of Ukraine.",
      "Time is not on Ukraine's side. In 2025 there is danger on several fronts - a lack of manpower, a possible reduction in future US military aid, and fading international attention.",
      "Yuliia accepts that life goes on in other countries.",
      "\"People can't live in constant stress, thinking only about us,\" she says.",
      "\"Still, I would like them to remember that there's a war happening nearby, where not only soldiers but also civilians are dying.\"",

    "title": "How a kabaddi club in India is changing girls' lives",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A kabaddi club has helped Indian girls find new opportunities and become financially independent as adults.",
    "story": [
      "Meena's eyes dart from left to right and back again, searching for the fleeting moment when she can make her move.",
      "She is playing Kabaddi, an Indian contact sport now played in more than 50 countries across the world.",
      "A Kabaddi game is played between two teams, each with seven players. Individuals take turns to run into the opposition's half of the pitch to tag opponents and make it back to their own half without being tackled to the ground.",
      "But for 14-year-old Meena, this is about more than winning points. The sport offers an escape from a restricted, rural life and opens up a world of opportunities.",
      "\"It feels different when I play,\" she says shyly, struggling to find the words. \"In that moment, I am not the Meena who is bound to housework, weighed down by pressures and expectations. It's just me and the opponent\u2026 It feels like I am more powerful than other girls who don't play.\"",
      "Meena lives on the outskirts of a small tribal village, Kudoshi, about 230km away from India's financial capital, Mumbai, where girls' lives traditionally revolve around household chores, marriage and children.",
      "But 15 years ago, a group of teachers at the village school decided they wanted to give girls more opportunities.",
      "\"I have a daughter. I want her to achieve things in life, live the best life she can, be something,\" says one of them, Daji Rajguru. \"Why can't girls play Kabaddi and make a career out of it?\"",
      "So he and his colleagues, who had played Kabaddi when they were younger, thought it would be good to teach local girls how to play. The pooled their savings - 5,000 rupees ($60; \u00a350) - persuaded the school to let them use its grounds, and opened what they believe was the region's first all-girls Kabaddi club.",
      "At the start, just two girls, who were pupils at the school, joined up. \"Parents were not ready to let their girls play Kabaddi as it meant spending a lot of time away from home,\" he says. \"They also worried about the impact it might have on their daughter's marriage prospects,\" as traditional families would not approve of girls going out and coming home late.",
      "Daji and his colleagues went door to door reassuring parents their daughters would be safe playing Kabaddi at training sessions before and after school. They reassured them they would supervise the girls properly and not let them be distracted by boys.",
      "At the start, the teachers would pick the girls up from their homes and drop them off, but as numbers grew they were no longer able to do that. Now, there are about 30 girls in the club and they estimate that about 300 have trained with them since they began coaching, including Daji's own daughter. Some start playing as young as seven years old.",
      "Like the rest of the members of the club, Meena trains for two hours before school and two hours after classes finish. She has to leave home at dawn and doesn't get back until nightfall.",
      "\"I go alone and it's dark [in the morning]. I used to be afraid that somebody could do something to me. My family was not supportive then, and are still unhappy with my choice to become a sportswoman,\" she says.",
      "But she is persevering, inspired by club members who have excelled over the years and joined state teams or local leagues.  Siddhi Chalke and Samreen Burandkar were among the first batch of girls who trained at the club for about eight years. Now, at the age of 25, they are professional league players and are financially independent.",
      "At the start, their families thought playing Kabaddi was a phase that would pass, and when the women decided to make a career of it, their parents were not happy. There is still pressure for them to get married but at the same time their families are also proud that the women are doing well.",
      "\"No-one in my family earns as much as I do,\" says Samreen. \"I now live in a big city and get to make my own choices. Coming from my community, it's difficult for girls to go after what they want. I am only here because of Kabaddi,\" she says.",
      "Siddhi plays on the same team as Samreen - their friendship born out of Kabaddi. They have travelled around India for competitions, winning medals and championships. \"I could only do that because of Kabaddi. Otherwise, I would have been married and ended up at my husband's place washing the dishes,\" says Siddhi and they both laugh, seemingly relieved that they have escaped this fate.",
      "Excelling in sports in India can also help players get jobs in the public sector. Indian states allocate jobs for high achievers in sports, guaranteeing an income even after a player's active sporting years are over.",
      "Many rural girls take up sport with the dream of getting financial independence via these jobs. It can also help them get greater respect and a sense of identity.",
      "\"When we started the sports club, no-one gave any importance to these girls. They were always secondary citizens in their homes, in society,\" says Vilas Bendre, a young coach at the club.",
      "\"But we realised that when rural girls climb ahead in their lives through sports, their lives change significantly. The way they talk, the way they carry themselves, their lifestyle, everything changes.\"",
      "Even if they haven't become professional sportswomen, many members of the club have seen their confidence grow and have persuaded their families to let them go to university and delay marriage until they are older.",
      "The community has become more accepting too, and when they see girls exercising, people don't frown at them any more.",
      "The club is funded by the coaches, cash prizes that the team win in competitions and occasional donations. Most of the girls are from poor and underprivileged families and don't have to pay any subscription fees.",
      "As well as training in term time, the club organises and funds residential sports camps at the school in the summer, provides food such as eggs, bananas and milk, and often pays for treatment for players' injuries.",
      "Over time, parents' fears have been assuaged, but critics sometimes question the coaches' motives. \"People say things indirectly like. 'Why don't you coach boys?'\" says Daji. But he says there are already opportunities for boys, and there is a gap when it comes to girls.",
      "\"We are not just their coaches,\" adds Vilas. \"At times we are their parents, guiding them, disciplining them, helping them make the right choice.\"",
      "And Meena knows the potential of this prized opportunity: \"I want to be the best raider and become the captain of India's Kabaddi team,\" she says, daring to dream about medals, championships and leaving an ordinary village girl's life behind.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:43:27 -0500",
    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak.

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:17:11 -0500",
    "summary": "The playful anarchy of author-illustrator Dav Pilkey's bestselling \"Dog Man\" series, about a hero cop who is part-man, part-police dog, is now on screen in a new animated film, with comedian Pete Davidson playing Dog Man's arch-nemesis, Petey the Cat.",
    "story": [
      "It's hard to believe, but as author and Illustrator Dav Pilkey recently told students at Boy's Prep in the Bronx, he created Dog Man back when he was in second grade. \"He looks a little bit different,\" he said.",
      "The kids loved hearing when someone with learning disabilities (\"I had ADHD, and I was dyslexic, and I was the class clown, and I couldn't sit still,\" he said) could go on to be so successful.",
      "Every book in Pilkey's Dog Man series has been the bestselling children's book for the year it came out.",
      "And as the new film out next week reminds us, it all started when a police officer and his dog got into a bad accident \u2013 and doctors sewed the head of the dog onto the man's body, creating \u2026 Dog Man!",
      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",
      "Asked if it's hard for someone else to control his characters, Pilkey said, \"No, no. Not at all actually. I'm just so honored that they wanted to do something with my characters, so I was like, YESSS!!! Jumping up and down.\"",
      "But Pilkey says what really matters to him is seeing how much kids appreciate all the work he puts into his books.",
      "Asked whether he ever worries about running out of ideas, he said, \"No, I think I worry about running out of time to get all of my ideas down on paper!\"",

    "title": "The spirit of Sundance",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "This month, the Sundance Film Festival is once again providing a showcase for independent filmmakers and documentarians from around the world. But that isn't all that Sundance does. \"Sunday Morning\" goes behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Park City Utah is a snow globe kind of place. It sparkles and glitters like a fairy tale, especially at this time of year, when the silver screens of Sundance come to this silver mining town, and young filmmakers start thinking of the moment they might see some glitter of their own.",
      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",

That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's controversial pick to head the federal Department of Health and Human Services, will appear Wednesday before a Senate panel that is crucial to advance his nomination.",
      "Kennedy is due to appear first at the Senate Committee on Finance, the panel that will ultimately be the committee with the deciding vote on whether his nomination to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services advances to the full Senate. He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",
      "That committee's focus includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, all agencies that would fall under Kennedy's authority if he is confirmed to lead the department.",
      "Trump's picks to head all of those agencies will also need to face their own Senate confirmation hearings. While some have voiced different opinions from him in the past, Kennedy could have broad authority to override them as secretary.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda?",
      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on abortion rights?",
      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",
      "The FDA's decision to ease those so-called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone were the focus of a Supreme Court case last year that ended in defeat for abortion opponents.",
      "\"Walking back REMS has significantly increased safety risks for women. And so from our perspective, as directed by the administration, we do believe that an RFK HHS has the ability to direct the FDA to review safety,\" said John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life.",
      "Mize's group has petitioned the FDA \"urging the reinstatement of basic safety measures\" while additional data is collected on their risks. He cited the death of Amber Thurman in a high-profile case that made headlines last year after a medication abortion.",
      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",
      "In his government ethics agreement, Kennedy also promises for a year to not intervene in any matters involving a nonprofit he chaired, Children's Health Defense, which has battled federal agencies over vaccine authorizations and requirements.",
      "\"They're not interested in validating the press narrative that Bobby's going to come in and make sweeping changes in vaccine policy. That's going to be kind of political suicide right now,\" Dr. Robert Malone, a close Kennedy ally who has fiercely opposed the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor and head of the Senate's health committee, said he had \"a frank conversation\" on \"vaccines at length\" with Kennedy after voicing concern over his past statements.",
      "The FDA's top vaccines official has also voiced optimism that he might find common ground with Kennedy over vaccines.",
      "\"This is how the sausage gets made. And you know, it's not always pretty and it isn't always what you want, but I'm really encouraged to see Bobby be pragmatic about the political realities here,\" said Malone.",
      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin healthcare systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",

      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",

Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states.

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",
      "Looney's vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make\u00a0animal-to-human transplants a reality. Looney the\u00a0fifth American\u00a0given a\u00a0gene-edited pig organ.",
      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she's the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that's functioning,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney's transplant.",
      "Montgomery called Looney's kidney function \"absolutely normal.\" Doctors hope she can leave New York \u2013 where she's temporarily living for post-transplant checkups \u2013 for her Gadsden, Alabama, home in about another month.",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",
      "How Looney fares is a \"very precious experience,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world's first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis.",
      "Looney was far healthier than the prior patients, Kawai noted, so her progress will help inform the next attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday has ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze\u00a0as she considers arguments from the U.S. government and the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",

      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid are excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",

John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "title": "What has DEI actually done for U.S. workers and employers?",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:41:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed is expected to hold off on another rate cut at its Jan. 29 meeting. Here's what it means for your finances.",
    "story": [
      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is expected to hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, according to more than 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data site FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "A January pause would mark an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed signaled that it expects fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. On top of that, economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about a rate pause by the fed.",
      "When does the Fed make its next rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "But a pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

      "The self-serve condiment bars, home to creamers, milk, sweeteners and stirrers, were removed from Starbucks locations during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks previously said the return to letting customers do it themselves will help free up baristas to make other drinks.",

    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",

      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",

      "\"SSA's ability to implement the law in a timely manner and without negatively affecting day-to-day customer service relies on funding,\" according to the agency. \"Though SSA is helping some affected beneficiaries now, under SSA's current budget, SSA expects that it could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\"",

      "Signed into law\u00a0in December by former President Joe Biden, the Social Security Fairness Act expands benefits for millions by eliminating two federal policies that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's news conference earlier this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",

      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",

      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",

      "Mr. Trump's order does not invalidate the law, and private and federal employees are still protected from discrimination as laid out under the Civil Rights Act. But his order does strike down the 1965 rule prohibiting contractors that do business with the government from taking race, gender and the other protected criteria into account.",
      "More broadly, revoking the 60-year-old Equal Employment Opportunity order eliminates a bedrock of civil rights protection for American workers, signaling an effort to target workplace issues that go beyond DEI, labor experts say. While DEI is shorthand for programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups, the Equal Employment Opportunity rule prohibited federal contractors from engaging in acts of discrimination, such as refusing to hire someone due to their race or paying an employee less because of their gender.",
      "\"It is still stunning to me that he took such an extraordinary step,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, CEO of the National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on gender justice. Revoking the rule signals \"he is going after something bigger: the basic and foundational idea that we should be able to work at workplaces without discrimination.\"",
      "She added, \"We agreed to that 60 years ago, and I'll add that people in this country support it, too.\"",
      "What was the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "The rule required federal contractors to \"take affirmative action\" to ensure that workers aren't discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin. This covered everything from hiring to promotions and pay, with the Department of Labor tasked with overseeing and enforcing the rule.",
      "How does revoking the rule impact protections for workers?",
      "It's still illegal under U.S. law for employers to discriminate on the basis of race, gender or other traits, labor experts said.",
      "But rescinding the Equal Employment Opportunity rule could have a chilling effect on cases where workers at federal contractors allege they have been treated unfairly and could impact the Department of Labor's ability to pursue workplace discrimination cases, Josh Boxerman, government affairs manager at the National Employment Law Project, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Taking away this set of tools puts workers at a disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Does this have an impact on private employers?",
      "While the Equal Employment Opportunity rule focuses on federal contractors, Mr. Trump's executive orders could spill over to private employers, said Alex Hontos, a partner at law firm Dorsey & Whitney and expert on government contracting.",
      "\"It's not just about government contractors and grantees,\" Hontos said. \"It is clearly a stepwise approach and is going to apply to the private sector. You see that at the back end of the [executive order], where attorneys general have been directed to put a plan together to either call out private-sector companies that are involved in DEI or to actually seek enforcement actions in some way.\"",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's orders banning DEI from federal agencies, corporations, including Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart, have been stepping back from these programs. Those decisions followed a 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "Why is President Trump banning DEI and revoking the Equal Employment Opportunity rule?",
      "Mr. Trump's aim is to restore what the administration considers to be a merit-based hiring system, according to officials and his executive orders.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence and hard work,' the president wrote in the order to revoke the 1965 rule.",
      "DEI policies, he wrote, have led to \"illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\"",
      "Numerous lawsuits have taken aim at DEI programs, with some alleging that the policies discriminate against people who aren't minorities or that they violate some workers' rights to free speech, among other allegations,\u00a0according to New York University's Meltzer Center.",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't getting rid of the concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion as they are typically understood,\" a viewpoint from Erec Smith, research fellow at the Cato Institute and co-founder of Free Black Thought, a nonprofit dedicated to highlighting viewpoint diversity within Black communities. \"He's getting rid of the critical social justice version, which is inherently divisive.\"",
      "The order sends a clear message that the Trump administration does not support such initiatives.",
      "What will happen with DEI programs?",
      "DEI programs are being scrubbed from the federal government, according to the Trump administration's directives.",
      "All federal employees in DEI roles were placed on leave by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Agencies were also told to \"take down all outward facing media (websites, social media accounts, etc.) of DEIA [Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility] offices\"; cancel upcoming DEI trainings; and terminate contracts with DEI-related contractors by the same time Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's Jan. 21 executive order requires federal agencies to come up with \"up to nine potential civil compliance investigations\" of publicly traded companies, large nonprofits and other private institutions with DEI programs that \"constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.\"",
      "That part of the executive order \"seems to be an attempt to intimidate the private sector,\" NELP's Boxerman said of the requirement to pursue civil investigations in the private sector. \"This seems to be a clear effort to name and shame companies that are doing the right thing,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Discount store chain Target says it's joining rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
    "story": [
      "Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, as a \"next chapter\" in a decades-long process to create \"inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\"",
      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "In 2020, Target pledged to give $10 million to social justice initiatives and to rebuild areas of the Twin Cities damaged by riots. At that time, Target leaders said they wanted to increase their Black workforce by 20% over the next three years.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, Harley-Davison, John Deere and Lowe's are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government. The order cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials.",
      "A memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \"inclusivity is a core belief at Target\" and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \"corresponds with their gender identity.\"",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media. The campaign\u00a0threatened employees and there were some instances of damaged products and displays in stores. In response, Target removed certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.",
      "The company did not stock its stores with Pride Month products in 2024.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",

    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",

      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",

      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",

      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",

The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",

      "\"Every car that comes out of any dealership is going to raise the prices,\" Maoli said. \"Parts come from all over the world.\"",
      "The average price of a new passenger vehicle in the U.S. in December was $49,740, according to Kelly Blue Blook.",
      "Maoli speculates that if tariffs are implemented, prices for new cars could jump anywhere from 5% to \"up to 15%.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2025 19:20:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Nearly 60% of Americans don't have enough money put away to handle common financial emergencies, according to Bankrate.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's a busted refrigerator, car trouble or medical issues, unexpected costs are a part of life. But even such routine curveballs often spell serious financial trouble for many Americans.",
      "That's according to a new Bankrate report that surveyed more than 1,000 U.S. adults about their ability to handle a surprise bill. Despite the country's current\u00a0low unemployment rate, the annual study found that 59% of Americans in 2025 don't have enough savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense.",
      "\"We are essentially a paycheck-to-paycheck nation,\" Bankrate Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a statement. \"Fewer Americans have the equivalent of a financial safety net to cover inevitable unexpected expenses, despite low unemployment and steady growth. This is one of the consequences of elevated prices stemming from inflation, the impacts of which are still being felt.\"",
      "A key issue in the 2024 presidential election, inflation and the rising\u00a0cost of everyday items\u00a0continues to impact Americans. Grocery inflation during the height of the coronavirus epidemic reached a\u00a0peak of 13.5% in 2022, while the overall rate of inflation for all products and services topped out at 9.1%.",
      "Although inflation has cooled to an annual rate of 2.9% as of December, prices for food, shelter and many other items remain elevated. Consumers also have found that many common products, from snacks to paper towels, have gotten smaller, a retailing tactic\u00a0known as \"shrinkflation\u00a0aimed at cutting a manufacturer's costs.",
      "In his Jan. 20 inaugural speech, President Trump said he would direct his cabinet \"to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices.\"",
      "Whether the Trump administration can engineer such a feat remains to be seen, while polls suggest that many Americans are skeptical that prices will return to earth. Economists also warn that Mr. Trump's policies, which could include steep new tariffs on U.S. imports and the deportation millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary.",
      "Younger Americans worry most",
      "To be sure, the meteoric rise in the cost of food, housing and health care over the past several years has made it hard for many households to make ends meet, let alone save money. Bankrate's survey shows that 73% of Americans said they're saving less for unexpected expenses, compared with 68% in 2024.",
      "\"Though inflation is no longer rising as quickly as it did in recent years, more people this year feel the economy has affected their savings,\" according to the Bankrate report.",
      "Younger Americans tend to have the strongest concerns about their savings. A whopping 80% of Gen Zers worry about being able to cover immediate expenses if they were to suddenly lose their primary source of income, compared with 72% for Millennials and Gen Xers. Some 58% of Baby Boomers say they regularly fret about having enough money put away, a particular concern given that many are already retired.",
      "Borrower nation",
      "Only 41% of Americans said they would be able to tap their savings to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense, according to Bankrate's report. That's down 3% from 2024 and the lowest the percentage since 2021 (39%)",
      "Another 25% said they would use a credit card to pay for a $1,000 bill, 13% said they would turn to a family member for the money and 5% said they would take out a personal loan. In total, about 43% of respondents told Bankrate they would have to borrow money to pay for an emergency expense of $1,000.",
      "That's a concern given consumers collectively owe a record $1.14 trillion in credit card debt, figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u00a0show. Meanwhile, credit card rates continue to soar, hovering round 24%.",
      "\"The cost of living continues to rise, prompting more individuals and households to turn to credit cards when in a bind,\" Hamrick said. \"They are a terrific tool when used wisely and effectively. But with interest rates still high, we need to avoid a deepening debt burden which could make it more challenging to save.\"",
      "Another 13% of Americans said they would pay for a surprise $1,000 debt by curbing their spending, On a positive note, while 36% of adults said their credit card debt exceeded what they had in emergency savings, Bankrate found that more than half of survey respondents, at 55%, had more emergency savings in 2024 than credit card debt. That's the highest percentage since 2018.",
      "Asked how much they have in emergency savings, 28% of respondents said they had enough to cover six months of expenses; 16% said they had enough to cover three to five months; 29% had enough to cover less than three months' worth of bills; and 27% said they had no emergency savings at all.",
      "Tips for saving now",
      "For people who consider themselves among the roughly one-third of Americans who want to reduce their debt and boost their emergency savings in 2025, Bankrate offers three tips:",
      "Calculate how much you need to save.\u00a0As a general target, experts recommend saving three to six months' worth of expenses in case of emergencies. To figure out how much to put away, add the total amount you spend each month on food, housing, gas and other bills. So if your monthly bills amount to $2,000 a month, you'll need $6,000 in savings to stay afloat in case of an emergency, such as a job loss.",
      "Open a savings account just for emergencies.\u00a0Opening an online savings account, money market account, money market mutual fund or a separate savings account with your existing bank or credit union can help you save for unexpected emergencies.",

      "The Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the maker of the addictive painkiller oxycontin, have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with a bipartisan coalition of 15 states for fueling the opioid crisis, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Thursday.",
      "The settlement bars the Sackler family from selling opioids in the U.S. and ends its control of Purdue. This comes seven months after the Supreme Court overturned a prior deal with Purdue that would have given the Sackler family immunity from future opioid lawsuits, a provision that is not part of the new deal.",
      "This is the largest settlement with contributors to the opioid crisis in the U.S. The Sackler family will pay the vast majority of the settlement \u2014 a total of $6.5 billion over 15 years \u2014 while Purdue will pay nearly $900 million up front, if it's approved by the court.",
      "Over half of the settlement will be distributed over the first few years, including almost $3 billion from the Sacklers. The Sacklers will make a $1.5 billion initial payment, adding another $500 million after one year, $500 million after two years and the remaining $400 million after three years.",
      "The funds will go to communities nationwide to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "\"Families throughout New York and across the nation are suffering from the immense pain and loss wrought by the opioid crisis,\" James said in a release announcing the settlement Thursday. \"The Sackler family relentlessly pursued profit at the expense of vulnerable patients and played a critical role in starting and fueling the opioid epidemic. While no amount of money will ever fully repair the damage they caused, this massive influx of funds will bring resources to communities in need so that we can heal.\"",
      "\"The Sacklers' no longer have control of Purdue will never be allowed to sell opioids in the United States again,\" she added.",

In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",

    "summary": "Local officials in Samoa don't blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's HHS pick, for measles deaths, but critics call his actions \"harmful.\"",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. senators grill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week, President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to face sharp questions about his actions in an island nation half a world away.",
      "Kennedy's 2019 visit to Samoa has recently brought fresh attention to his history of activism focused on raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine \u2014 because his trip came just months before a devastating measles outbreak that claimed 83 lives, many of them young children.",
      "\"It was very sad,\" Dr. Take Naseri, Samoa's health chief at the time, told CBS News. \"It's one of those things you don't want to revisit.\"",
      "Kennedy has maintained that he had \"nothing to do\" with the people of Samoa resisting vaccines.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

      "Ullyot said Hegseth \"also directed\" the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General to \"conduct an inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding Gen. Milley's conduct so that the Secretary may determine whether it is appropriate to reopen his military grade review determination.\"",
      "Acting Defense Department Inspector General Stephen Stebbins received a request to review whether Milley, a four-star general, should be stripped of a star, a spokesperson with the Pentagon's inspector general's office also told CBS News. Stebbins is reviewing the request.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Milley to head the Joint Chiefs during his first term, a position Milley held for a full four-year term from 2019 until 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump and Milley, however, had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over several incidents, beginning with an apology Milley issued for taking part, while dressed in fatigues, in the photo op in front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House.",
      "A book published in September 2021 revealed that Milley had also engaged in two phone calls \u2014 one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection \u2014 with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable.",
      "At the time of the revelation, Mr. Trump claimed Milley should be tried for \"treason.\" Then, in a shocking\u00a02023 social media post, Mr. Trump suggested the calls constituted a \"treasonous act\" that could warrant execution.",
      "In an October 2023 interview with \"60 Minutes,\" Milley said the calls were \"an example of deescalation. So \u2014 there was clear indications \u2014 that the Chinese were very concerned about what they were observing \u2014 here in the United States.\"",
      "According to another 2021 book, Milley feared that Mr. Trump would attempt a coup after losing the 2020 election and made preparations in case such a plan had been carried out.",
      "On Jan. 20, as he was leaving office, former President Joe Biden preemptively pardoned Milley along with others he thought could be targeted by the Trump administration.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Joe Kasper, Defense Department Chief of Staff, told CBS News that \"undermining the chain of command is corrosive to our national security, and restoring accountability is a priority for the Defense Department under President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also revoked the federal security details\u00a0of former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, former Trump special envoy on Iran Brian Hook and\u00a0Dr. Anthony Fauci, former longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.",

      "What was a 33-33 tie in the Senate will now lean in the Democrats' favor. The chamber had been operating under a power-sharing agreement until the election.

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 23:08:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE and Medicaid, exclude coverage for gender-affirming care for those under 19.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aimed at cutting federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under age 19, his latest move to roll back protections for transgender people across the country.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order says.",
      "The order covers gender-affirming care that includes puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care and calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.",
      "Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care. The new order suggests that the practice could end, and targets hospitals and universities that receive federal money and provide the care.",
      "The language in the executive order \u2014 using words such as \"maiming,\" \"sterilizing\" and \"mutilation\" \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. It also labels guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health as \"junk science.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump called gender-affirming care \"barbaric medical procedures.\"",
      "Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to care.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.",
      "\"It is deeply unfair to play politics with people's lives and strip transgender young people, their families and their providers of the freedom to make necessary health care decisions,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson.",
      "The order encourages Congress to adopt a law allowing those who receive gender-affirming care and come to regret it, or their parents, to sue the providers.",
      "It also directs the Justice Department to prioritize investigating states that protect access to gender-affirming care and \"facilitate stripping custody from parents\" who oppose the treatments for their children. Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws that seek to protect doctors who provide gender-affirming care to patients who travel from states where it's banned for minors.",
      "Lambda Legal promised swift legal action.",
      "Michel Lee Garrett, a trans woman whose teenage child only partially identifies as a girl and uses they/them pronouns, said such policies aim to erase trans people from public life but will never succeed. Her child has not elected to pursue a medical transition, but the mother from State College, Pennsylvania, said she won't stop fighting to preserve that option for her child and others.",
      "\"I'll always support my child's needs, regardless of what policies may be in place or what may come ... even if it meant trouble for me,\" Lee Garrett said.",
      "For Howl Hall, an 18-year-old first-year student at Eastern Washington University, taking testosterone not only changed his body but dramatically improved his experience with depression. With that treatment now under threat, Hall said he's concerned that getting off testosterone would hurt his mental health.",
      "\"I would be alive, but I wouldn't be living,\" Hall said. \"I wouldn't be living my life in a productive way at all. I can guarantee that I would be failing all of my classes if I was even showing up to them.\"",
      "The push is the latest by Mr. Trump to reverse Biden administration policies protecting transgender people and their care. On Monday, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct a review that is likely to lead to them being barred from military service.",
      "That order's language stated that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that soldiers who do so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "A group of active-duty military personnel sued over the executive order Tuesday.",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit organization for trans service members and veterans, released a\u00a0statement\u00a0saying: \"Transgender service members have been serving openly for almost ten years, and currently fill critical roles in every branch and specialty, including infantry, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. ... The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Hours after taking office last week, Mr. Trump signed another order that seeks to define sex as only male or female, not recognizing transgender, nonbinary or intersex people or the idea that gender can be fluid. Already that's resulted in the State Department halting issuing passports with an \"X\" gender marker, forcing transgender people to apply for travel documents with markers that don't match their identities.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would address these issues during his campaign last year, and his actions could prove widely divisive.",
      "In the November election, voters were slightly more likely to oppose than support laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors under the age of 18 who identify as transgender, according to AP VoteCast. About half of voters, 52%, were opposed, but 47% said they were in favor.",
      "Mr. Trump's voters were much more likely to support bans on transgender care: About 6 in 10 Trump voters favored such laws.",
      "\"It's very clear that this order, in combination with the other orders that we've seen over the past week, are meant to not protect anyone in this country, but rather to single-mindedly drive out transgender people of all ages from all walks of civic life,\" said Harper Seldin, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.",
      "Seldin said the ACLU is reviewing the order \"to understand what, if anything, has immediate effect versus what needs to go through continued agency action.\"",
      "Even as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts, they've become major targets for social conservatives. In recent years, at least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Most of those states face lawsuits, including one over Tennessee's ban that's pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republican-controlled states have also moved to keep transgender women and girls from competing in women's or girls' sports and to dictate which bathrooms transgender people can use, particularly in schools.",
      "\"These policies are not serving anyone,\" said Shelby Chestnut, executive director of the Transgender Law Center. \"They're only creating confusion and fear for all people.\"",

They also included USAID attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel, who are responsible for interpreting the executive orders for implementation.",

      "CBS News has also learned that several hundred contractors at USAID have been furloughed or laid off, according to six sources familiar with the action. Some have been notified they have been terminated immediately without severance pay and that their benefits will expire in just three days, at the end of January, while others who have been furloughed have been told their benefits will remain in effect through the end of February.",
      "Rubio's order is part of an effort by the administration to meet President Trump's campaign promises of shrinking the size of the federal workforce, and looking for places to cut what it sees as wasteful government spending. Mr. Trump has long held that other nations are not contributing enough when it comes to foreign aid, and that the U.S. is bearing the brunt of the burden. But critics say such cuts could undermine America's standing in the world and create an opening for China and other adversaries looking to exert their influence abroad.",
      "In response to Rubio's mandate to halt federal foreign assistance, stop-work orders were issued on Monday and Tuesday to companies that hold contracts with USAID and the State Department.",
      "Termination letters sent to two contractors obtained by CBS News read, \"This letter is to inform you that effective January 28, 2025, your employment with [federal contract holder] will be terminated due to a contract layoff. Unfortunately, [federal contract holder] received a Stop Work Order, and without authority to proceed, we have no work for you to perform.\"",
      "There is language in the termination letters reading, \"We hope this situation is temporary and that you can return to your positions.\" However, the employees' email accounts with USAID and the contracting company were shut off, and the termination letters were sent afterwards to their personal emails, sources said.",

      "Rubio, later on Tuesday, then issued a waiver to his own foreign assistance pause. In a second memo provided to CBS by a senior administration official, Rubio stated the waiver applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance\", which he defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "The memo also stated, \"Implementers of existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work if they have stopped.\"",
      "The new waiver does not apply to \"activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, gender or DEl ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,\" per the memo.",
      "The State Department has not yet provided clarification on whether some U.S.-funded foreign aid programs are now automatically exempt as a result of Rubio's new waiver, or whether all programs globally must still apply for a waiver in order to opt back into receiving U.S. funding.",
      "It is not immediately clear how this new waiver will impact those whose employment has already been terminated.",
      "In the copy of Rubio's initial order obtained by CBS News last Friday, he told all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders \"for existing foreign assistance awards,\" pending review by the Secretary of State.",
      "Rubio had also stated in his initial order that \"exceptions\" to the pause approved by the State Department Director of Foreign Assistance Office are also exempt, without further specifying what those exceptions are. CBS News has learned that Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon, is now serving in a senior directing role within the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office \u2014 known internally as 'F' \u2014 which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "\"I'm so devastated [as] to what just took place,\" one impacted USAID source said. \"We enjoyed the work we'd done and how it contributed to helping people all over the world. What took place was not fair at all. This has never taken place in any administration change, ever,\" they said, adding that they had respected the change and had been \"looking forward to building a relationship with the new administration for the better good.\"",
      "Two now-former USAID contractors voiced deep concerns about having life-threatening health conditions, in one case exacerbated by frequent work travel, and suddenly finding themselves without medical insurance after the end of the month on Friday.",
      "\"Our contractor could have paid us for two weeks. Or at least through next week so that we could have health insurance through February,\" says another USAID contractor whose employment was terminated on Tuesday. \"It feels apocalyptic. Every email felt like a threat starting last week and then they followed through.\" The source added that in their office on Monday and Tuesday \"people were in disarray and bawling\u2026People are terrified. Direct hires are feeling intense survivor's guilt and don't know what to do.\"",
      "A number of USAID contractors were also terminated last week without being placed on leave or receiving severance as a result of the executive order targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs. This included individuals who were not DEI advisers, or did not have primary job functions related to DEI, but may have contributed to collective workplace efforts focused on inclusivity and accessibility in the Biden administration.",
      "Termination letters sent to those employees last Thursday evening read, \"Effective immediately, USAID no longer requires the services you currently perform on the contract. As of today, USAID is ending funding for this position.\"",
      "Multiple sources also told CBS News that in several Washington, D.C.-based USAID annex office buildings, photographs hanging up of the agencies' programs and beneficiaries have been stripped from the walls. The removal of photographs is \"not normal protocol\" between administrations, one source said.",
      "\"They're physically dismantling things in the building,\" a second source said. \"They're erasing our existence,\" said a third.",
      "Contractors with USAID's Bureau for Global Health \u2014 the department responsible for projects covering HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child health, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases \u2014 were among those who received termination notices on Tuesday. According to two sources, all contractors in the Global Health Bureau, roughly 450 technical experts, were terminated. Those contractors make up about 50% of the entire USAID global health staff, leaving only about 450 direct hires still employed in that bureau.",
      "The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR \u2014 started by the administration of George W. Bush in 2003 \u2014 is among the notable government programs suddenly brought to a halt since Rubio issued the order, potentially interrupting the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions of HIV and AIDS patients globally.\u00a0 According to the State department, PEPFAR has saved the lives of 26 million people since it started.",
      "While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there is also growing concern among advocates that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation earlier this month that groups receiving aid performed abortions, which is a violation of U.S. law. Reuters reported that four nurses in Mozambique had performed 21 abortions since 2021. That revelation may also be part of the upcoming State Department review.",
      "Currently 20.6 million people globally are on life-saving drugs due to PEPFAR, one source told CBS News, so the freeze in U.S. aid funding could lead to \"hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly for women and children, depending on the length of the freeze.\"",
      "\"This is a crime against humanity,\" the source added.",
      "\"This purge is unprecedented, is a threat to our national security, makes America less safe, and seems [to be] circumventing congressional authority,\" one former USAID employee said.",
      "\"To me, this is an unmitigated hostile takeover of our democracy,\" another source impacted by the federal assistance freeze said. \"USAID is just the first casualty. But more are coming imminently. With the intention to wield power for whatever purposes they feel like.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:09:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday has ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze\u00a0as she considers arguments from the U.S. government and the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid are excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",

      "More broadly, it directs the Department of Education to prioritize school choice programs through its discretionary grant programs, and orders the Department of Health and Human Services to issue guidance on how states receiving block grants for families and children can use those funds to support private and faith-based institutions.",
      "The president is expected to sign the order Wednesday, according to a senior administration official.",
      "The executive order also directs the Department of Education to issue guidance to states on how to use federal funding formulas \u2014 which determine how much money to allocate to districts and schools \u2014 to support their K-12 scholarship programs.",
      "The interior secretary, when confirmed, must also submit a plan to the president outlining how families with students at Bureau of Indian Education schools can use federal money to send those children to a school of their family's choosing. About 47,000 American Indian and Alaska Native students are enrolled in Bureau of Indian Education schools.",
      "It's not yet clear how much the administration can do without Congress to prioritize money for school choice programs, or to allow military children to go to the school of their parents' choosing.",
      "It's also not yet immediately clear if the Office of Management and Budget's directive to temporarily pause federal assistance would affect educational grant programs. A federal judge has also issued a stay on the order.",
      "Mr. Trump's new executive action comes as the soon-to-be-released National Assessment of Education Progress for 2024 is expected to show that 40% of 4th graders did not meet basic reading levels, the highest percentage ever recorded.",
      "The data will also show 4th and 8th grade average reading scores have continued a downward trend, each down two points from 2022. According to the NAEP, 70% of 8th graders weren't proficient in reading and 72% weren't proficient in math.",
      "The data is set to be released Wednesday at midnight.",
      "\"Every child deserves the best education available, regardless of their zip code,\" the White House document reads. \"However, for generations, our government-assigned education system has failed millions of parents, students and teachers. This executive order begins to rectify that wrong by opening up opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\"",
      "Federal funding represents a relatively small portion of funding for most public schools, about 14% of funding for public K-12 schools in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. States account for about 44% of funding, and localities about 43%.",
      "Mr. Trump championed school choice on the campaign trail, as well as during his first term in office.",

      "Only about 6% of federal employees work full-time in office, administration officials said. There are about 2 million federal government employees across the country, which means that the administration expects that as many as 200,000 may take the government's offer.",

He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",

      "Trump's picks to head all of those agencies will also need to face their own Senate confirmation hearings. While some have voiced different opinions from him in the past, Kennedy could have broad authority to override them as secretary.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda?",
      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",

      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",
      "The FDA's decision to ease those so-called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone were the focus of a Supreme Court case last year that ended in defeat for abortion opponents.",
      "\"Walking back REMS has significantly increased safety risks for women. And so from our perspective, as directed by the administration, we do believe that an RFK HHS has the ability to direct the FDA to review safety,\" said John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life.",
      "Mize's group has petitioned the FDA \"urging the reinstatement of basic safety measures\" while additional data is collected on their risks. He cited the death of Amber Thurman in a high-profile case that made headlines last year after a medication abortion.",
      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",
      "In his government ethics agreement, Kennedy also promises for a year to not intervene in any matters involving a nonprofit he chaired, Children's Health Defense, which has battled federal agencies over vaccine authorizations and requirements.",
      "\"They're not interested in validating the press narrative that Bobby's going to come in and make sweeping changes in vaccine policy. That's going to be kind of political suicide right now,\" Dr. Robert Malone, a close Kennedy ally who has fiercely opposed the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, told CBS News.",

      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",

      "The memo claims some $3 trillion was spent in 2024 on federal assistance programs.",
      "New York, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island said Tuesday they planned to sue, and were soon joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.",
      "\"What a ham-handed way to run a government. It is astonishing,\" said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Naronha, adding that the memo was \"written in such a way that it was barely understandable.\"",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta, joining the virtual press conference from the passenger seat of a car, said the memorandum was ambiguous in its wording, \"by design.\"",
      "The Monday night directive from the Office of Management and Budget said its goal was to advance White House priorities, including \"to advance a stronger and safer America, eliminating the financial burden of inflation for citizens, unleashing American energy and manufacturing, ending 'wokeness' and the weaponization of government, promoting efficiency in government, and making America healthy again.\"",
      "The memo directs federal agencies to assess compliance with President Trump's executive orders \u2014 specifically targeting \"DEI, woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal.\" It does not spell out what exactly these policies refer to, or what programs will be affected.",

      "The White House blamed an \"outage\" for locking out a wide range of organizations and agencies on Tuesday from the online systems responsible for drawing down federal health dollars.",
      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin healthcare systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Former Rep. Sean Duffy sailed through his Senate confirmation vote to be transportation secretary, just before some of President Trump's more controversial nominees will be facing their\u00a0confirmation hearings\u00a0this week.",
      "In a 77 to 22 vote, the Senate confirmed Duffy. The 53-year-old, represented Wisconsin in the House from 2011 to 2019 and previously served as the district attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin. He joined Fox News as a contributor and co-hosted a show on Fox Business after leaving Congress, until President Trump announced his selection for transportation secretary. He and his wife, whom he met on a reality television show, have nine children.",
      "The Senate voted unanimously to advance Duffy Monday night, after he appeared before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee earlier this month. At the hearing, he was introduced by the two Wisconsin senators \u2014 Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Tammy Baldwin.",
      "\"I am confident that Sean is the right person for this job in this upcoming administration,\" Baldwin said, adding that Duffy will work with \"both sides of the aisle to improve our infrastructure and address the challenges that arise in the years ahead.\"",
      "Duffy said in his opening statement that \"transportation impacts every aspect of life,\" pledging that with Mr. Trump and support from Congress, \"I would hope to usher in a golden age of transportation and travel.\"",
      "\"President Trump, he's a builder. He wants to invest in rebuilding our nation's crumbling infrastructure,\" Duffy said, adding that Trump asked him to focus on the \"big, the durable projects that connect our country and connect our people.\"",
      "Duffy said he would work to reduce red tape that slows critical infrastructure projects. And he pledged to prioritize road safety and keep safety as a top priority in aviation. He urged that the nation needs to modernize its systems, pledging to work to restore global confidence in Boeing and \"ensure that our skies are safe.\"",
      "\"Transportation is an extraordinary new era we're entering in,\" Duffy said. \"We're in a global race to out-innovate and out-compete the rest of the world. If confirmed, we will craft clear regulations which balance safety, innovation and cutting edge technology, but always focused on safety.\"'",
      "Duffy received significant bipartisan support for his confirmation. Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Duffy Monday as a five-term congressman and a co-chair of the Great Lakes task force, whom he said \"worked with Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate on a number of infrastructure projects.\"",
      "\"Mr. Duffy brings valuable experience that will help him in managing our nation's sprawling transportation system,\" Thune said. \"And he has some important work ahead of him.\"",
      "With Duffy's confirmation in hand, Thune teed up votes on a handful of other nominations in the coming days, including on Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Doug Burgum to be Secretary of the Interior, Christopher Wright for energy secretary and Doug Collins for Veterans Affairs secretary. Meanwhile, some of the most controversial nominees \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services and Kash Patel for FBI director \u2014 are set to come before Senate committees for confirmation hearings this week.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery of the unexplained drone sightings over New Jersey and along the East Coast late last year has been solved, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said she was relaying the update directly from President Trump in the Oval Office.",
      "In her first White House press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said, \"After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.\"",
      "\"Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones,\" she added. \"In time, it got worse due to curiosity. This was not the enemy.\"",
      "In December,\u00a0mysterious drone sightings\u00a0in\u00a0New Jersey,\u00a0New York,\u00a0Pennsylvania and other East Coast states prompted a demand for officials\u00a0to find the source\u00a0of the\u00a0flying objects, some of which were spotted near military installations.",

    "summary": "Judges heard nearly four hours of arguments over whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the authority to unwind plea deals reached with three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Department lawyers and defense attorneys for the three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks squared off before a federal appeals court Tuesday in a court fight over whether plea agreements reached with the defendants last summer can go forward.",
      "A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is considering whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin exceeded his authority when he revoked the pretrial agreements that military prosecutors reached with the defendants, including alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.",
      "The deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin 'Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi, were agreed to in late July following more than two years of negotiations. The agreements were approved by a senior Pentagon official who oversees the military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Brigadier General Susan Escallier, who Austin designated as convening authority for military commissions in 2023.",
      "Under the terms that have been released publicly, the men would plead guilty to eight charges arising from their alleged roles in the 9/11 terror attacks and in exchange, avoid the death penalty. The full parameters of the deals remain under seal.",
      "But shortly after the agreement was announced, Austin said he was rescinding them, writing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the pretrial deals, \"responsibility for such a decision should rest with me.\"",
      "The case arrived before the D.C. Circuit after a military commission judge in Guantanamo Bay, who has been overseeing the case, ruled in November that Austin's nullification was unlawful, rendering the agreements valid and enforceable.",
      "A military appeals court last month declined to let Austin rescind the pretrial agreements because the defendants had begun performing a promise contained in them.",
      "The U.S. government then asked the D.C. Circuit to step in and sought to stop the military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from accepting the agreements, as well as pause proceedings. The appeals court earlier this month agreed to put the plea hearing on hold and set arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The Justice Department is asking the D.C. Circuit to find that Austin validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements and bar the military commission from conducting plea hearings, during which the defendants would enter guilty pleas.",
      "\"We think this is the circumstance to issue the writ and effectuate and allow the secretary of defense's determinations to govern the course of the prosecutions of the alleged mastermind of 9/11 and the two alleged co-conspirators,\" Melissa Patterson, a Justice Department lawyer, told the three-judge panel.",
      "Judges Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao heard nearly four hours of arguments over Austin's decision to unwind the deals.",
      "Patterson revealed to the judges that as proceedings were getting underway, the military judge in Guantanamo Bay said he would begin taking the pleas from the three defendants Thursday morning if the D.C. Circuit denied relief to the government.",
      "She asked the court to leave its earlier order pausing proceedings in place if it sides with the 9/11 defendants to allow the Justice Department time to evaluate whether it should seek further review.",
      "Across the arguments, the judges peppered Patterson with questions as to why Austin waited until two days after the plea deals were reached to withdraw Escallier's authority to enter into the agreements and assume that power for himself.",
      "Austin could have placed limits on Escallier's ability to enter the pleas from the beginning, Rao, appointed by President Trump during his first term, said. She later acknowledged that the circumstances of the case and the government's interest are \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The judge said the executive branch had \"every opportunity\" and the power to take actions to exercise control over Escallier, the convening authority, before the agreements were reached.",
      "Millett, named to the D.C. Circuit by former President Barack Obama, said Austin's revocation of the deals two days after the offers were signed put \"all these courts into knots\" trying to figure out the next steps.",
      "The judges also weighed whether Austin missed his window to rescind the agreements altogether, as the rules governing military commissions allow the convening authority \u2014 defined as the secretary of defense or an official designed by the secretary \u2014 to withdraw from a deal at any time before a defendant begins performance of promises contained in them.",
      "\"It undermines the force and plausibility of your argument that the secretary was being prudent by waiting,\" Wilkins said, noting that there are events that could take place that would take away his authority to withdraw the deals.",
      "Michel Paradis, who is representing Mohammed in the case, said it is \"not appropriate\" for the government to ask the D.C. Circuit to \"save itself\" from a pretrial agreement that it entered into, and the defendants began to perform.",
      "The defense secretary, he said, had plenty of opportunities over a span of several years to know about and prevent the deals, but chose not to exercise his authority over the convening authority until two days after the offers were signed.",
      "It's unclear how soon the D.C. Circuit will issue its decision.",

    "story": [
      "Google Maps users in the United States can expect to see the body of water known for centuries as the Gulf of Mexico renamed the Gulf of America, aligning with the terms of President Trump's controversial executive order. Google also said Denali, a mountain in southern Alaska and North America's tallest peak, is going to be called Mount McKinley on its maps for those same users, reflecting the presidential mandate.",
      "The changes will not take effect until the government updates those site listings in the Geographic Names Information System, an official database that includes descriptions and location information for millions of places within the U.S. As of Tuesday morning, the Gulf of Mexico and Denali still appear as such in the directory.",
      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "In a news release, the agency said the changes \"reaffirm the Nation's commitment to preserving the extraordinary heritage of the United States and ensuring that future generations of Americans celebrate the legacy of its heroes and historic assets.\" The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was set to begin updating \"the official federal nomenclature in the Geographic Names Information System to reflect these changes, effective immediately for federal use,\" the department added.",
      "Although the federal government will formally reference both the Gulf and the mountain by their new names \u2014 in government documents and official U.S. maps, for example \u2014 other nations are not required recognize them. The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president. The name was changed formally to Denali by former President Barack Obama during his administration.",

      "\"Maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we would. They have to clean it up a little bit,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Former health officials tell CBS News they worry the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO could endanger efforts to respond to diseases, both undermining the U.N. agency and also making it harder for American officials to prepare.",

      "\"I don't think we want, particularly as public health experts, to feel like they can only wave the U.S. flag in those positions.

The action does not immediately ban transgender service members; however, it does state that the Defense Department's policy for troop readiness is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The order also states that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that those doing so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Speaking about his plans at a retreat with House Republicans Monday at his property in Doral, Florida, Mr. Trump said, \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit organization for trans service members and veterans, said in a\u00a0statement: \"Transgender service members have been serving openly for almost ten years, and currently fill critical roles in every branch and specialty, including infantry, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. ...

The proposal from Republican State Superintendent Ryan Walters, the state's education chief, wouldn't prohibit students without legal status from attending schools but would require districts to keep a tally.",

      "Alabama attempted a similar requirement for public schools to ask the immigration status of students as part of a sweeping immigration law in 2011, but the state ultimately agreed to permanently block those provisions after they had been temporarily halted by a federal appeals court.",

      "Only the first volume of Smith's report, which described the investigation into Mr. Trump's post-2020 election conduct, was released to the public. The second volume is currently shielded from public view while an appeal in the classified documents case is ongoing.",

Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",

The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",

      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",

      "According to experts, the vomit contains at least two species of sea lilies, likely eaten by a fish that threw up the parts it could not digest.",
      "\"This type of find... is considered very important when reconstructing past ecosystems because it provides important information about which animals were eaten by which,\" the museum said in a press release, which also included an image of the fossilized vomit.",
      "Paleontologist Jesper Milan hailed the discovery as \"truly an unusual find,\" adding it helped explain the relationships in the prehistoric food chain.",
      "\"Sea lilies are not a particularly nutritious diet, as they consist mainly of calcareous plates held together by a few soft parts,\" he said.",
      "\"But here is an animal, probably some kind of fish, that 66 million years ago ate sea lilies that lived at the bottom of the Cretaceous sea and regurgitated the skeletal parts.\"",
      "According to UNESCO, the Cliffs of Stevns offers \"exceptional evidence of the impact of the Chicxulub meteorite that crashed into the planet about 65 million years ago,\" which is widely believed to have caused the end of the age of the dinosaurs.",
      "Researchers have studied ancient regurgitated remains before. Last November, scientists used fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland to try to determine who was eating whom 200 million years ago, the Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "In 2018, researchers discovered fossilized vomit during an excavation in southeastern Utah, Live Science reported. In a study published in 2022 in the journal\u00a0Palaios, those scientists reported finding remnants of salamanders and frogs in the vomit.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:56:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Posts by President Trump and Elon Musk roiled the space community, raising the prospect of an earlier-than-planned return for the Starliner crew.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for \"abandoning\" two astronauts who have been stuck aboard the International Space Station in the wake of problems last summer with their Boeing Starliner capsule.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, the president said he has asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",
      "A Crew Dragon that will be used for a commercial space tourism flight around Earth's poles this spring is not believed to be an option because it is not equipped with a space station docking mechanism.",

      "NASA says after dark, throughout the month of January, you'll be able to see Venus, Saturn Jupiter and Mars. Venus and Saturn will appear in the southwest of the sky, Jupiter will appear overhead and Mars will rise in the east.",
      "Uranus and Neptune will also be there, but they won't be bright and visible without a telescope.",
      "So-called planetary parades are not super rare, according to NASA, but they don't happen every year. There was\u00a0planetary parade in June 2024 when six planets \u2014 Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus, Mars, Neptune and Saturn \u2014 all aligned.",
      "These events are often called a planetary alignment, but planets always appear in a line in the sky because they orbit the sun \u2014 the difference is that they will appear closer to each other and Earth, making them visible from our planet.",
      "Saturn and Venus will be making a close approach in January. Their closest approach to each other occurred on Jan. 17 and 18.",
      "Mars and Earth will also align in their orbits, and this will occur around the time when Mars is at its closets to Earth, so it will appear bigger and brighter in the night sky. This is called an opposition and it happens about every two years.",
      "In February, seven planets will be in alignment \u2013 Saturn, Mercury, Neptune, Venus, Uranus, Jupiter and Mars. Most will be visible to the naked eye, but to see Uranus and Neptune, you may need a telescope or binoculars,\u00a0according to Starwalk, a sky-gazing app that tracks space events for astronomers and amateur stargazers. This alignment will be most visible worldwide on February 28.",
      "Those who want to see this event should start looking for the alignment as soon as the sun sets. Some places might have a better view of the alignment on different days. For example, in New York, you might see the event best on Feb. 25, according to Starwalk.",

      "Findings showed WASP-127b, which is slightly larger than Jupiter but has only a fraction of its mass, had jet winds move at nearly six times the speed at which the planet rotates. In comparison, the fastest wind ever measured in the solar system was found on Neptune, moving at only 0.5 km per second, scientists said.",
      "The team mapped a surprisingly complex weather system on the planet by tracking the speed of molecules \u2014 they observed a double peak, indicating that one side of the atmosphere is moving towards us and the other away from us at high speed. This indicates that there is a powerful wind current going around the planet.",

    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "The changes will not take effect until the government updates those site listings in the Geographic Names Information System, an official database that includes descriptions and location information for millions of places within the U.S. As of Tuesday morning, the Gulf of Mexico and Denali still appear as such in the directory.",
      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "In a news release, the agency said the changes \"reaffirm the Nation's commitment to preserving the extraordinary heritage of the United States and ensuring that future generations of Americans celebrate the legacy of its heroes and historic assets.\" The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was set to begin updating \"the official federal nomenclature in the Geographic Names Information System to reflect these changes, effective immediately for federal use,\" the department added.",
      "Although the federal government will formally reference both the Gulf and the mountain by their new names \u2014 in government documents and official U.S. maps, for example \u2014 other nations are not required recognize them. The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president. The name was changed formally to Denali by former President Barack Obama during his administration.",

    "summary": "U.S. kids continued to lose ground on reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic\u200b and have made little improvement in math, an exam known as the nation's report card shows.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 America's children have continued to lose ground on reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little improvement in math, according to the latest results of an exam known as the nation's report card.",
      "The findings are yet another setback for U.S. schools and reflect the myriad challenges that have upended education, from pandemic school closures to a youth mental health crisis and high rates of chronic absenteeism. The national exam results also show growing inequality: While the highest-performing students have started to regain lost ground, lower-performing students are falling further behind.",
      "Given every two years to a sample of America's children, the National Assessment of Educational Progress is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and eighth-grade students on math and reading.",
      "\"The news is not good,\" said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the assessment. \"We are not seeing the progress we need to regain the ground our students lost during the pandemic.\"",
      "Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math, where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. It's still 3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average, yet some states and districts made significant strides, including in Washington, D.C., where the average score increased 10 points.",
      "For the most part, however, American schools haven't yet begun to make progress.",
      "The average math score for eighth grade students was unchanged from 2022, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third of eighth grade students scored below \"basic\" in reading, the most ever in the history of the assessment.",
      "Students are considered below basic if they are missing fundamental skills. For example, eighth grade students who scored below basic in reading were typically unable to make a simple inference about a character's motivation after reading a short story, and some were unable to identify that the word \"industrious\" means \"to be hard working.\"",
      "Especially alarming to officials was the divide between higher- and lower-performing students, which has grown wider than ever. Students with the highest scores outperformed their peers from two years ago, making up some ground lost during the pandemic. But the lowest performers are scoring even lower, falling further behind.",
      "It was most pronounced in eighth grade math: While scores of the top 10% of students increased by 3 points, the lowest 10% decreased by 6 points.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned about our low-performing students,\" said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policies for the exam. \"For a decade, these students have been on the decline. They need our urgent attention and our best effort.\"",
      "The latest setbacks follow a historic backslide in 2022. In that year's exam, student achievement fell across both subjects and grade levels, in some cases by unprecedented levels.",
      "This round of testing again featured students whose lives were disrupted by the pandemic. When COVID hit in 2020, the fourth graders were in kindergarten, and the eighth graders were in fourth grade.",
      "But Carr said poor results can no longer be blamed solely on the pandemic, warning that the nation's education system faces \"complex challenges.\"",
      "A survey done alongside the exam found in 2022 that fewer young students were reading for enjoyment, which is linked to lower reading scores. And new survey results found that students who are often absent from class - a persistent problem nationwide - are struggling the most.",
      "\"The data are clear,\" Carr said. \"Students who don't come to school are not improving.\"",
      "The results provide fresh fuel for a national debate over the impact of pandemic school closures, though they're unlikely to add clarity. Some studies have found that longer closures led to bigger academic setbacks. Those slower to reopen were often in urban and Democratic-led areas, while more rural and Republican-led areas were quicker.",
      "The new results don't show a \"direct link\" on the topic, Carr said, though she said students clearly do better when they're in school.",
      "Among the states that saw reading scores fall in 2024 are Florida and Arizona, which were among the first to return to the classroom during the pandemic. Meanwhile, some big school systems that had longer closures made strides in fourth grade math, including Los Angeles and New York City.",
      "The success of big urban districts - 14 of which saw notable improvement in fourth-grade math when the nation as a whole saw only minor gains - can be credited to academic recovery efforts funded by federal pandemic relief, said Ray Hart, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools. Investing in efforts like intensive tutoring programs and curriculum updates is \"really proving to make a difference,\" he said.",
      "Republicans in Congress were quick to cast blame on Democrats and former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the decline is \"clearly a reflection of the education bureaucracy continuing to focus on woke policies rather than helping students learn and grow.\"",
      "\"I'm thankful we have an administration that is looking to reverse course,\" he said in a reference to President Trump.",
      "Compared with 2019 results, eighth grade reading scores are now down 8 points. Reading scores are down 5 points in both grades. And in fourth grade math, scores are down 3 points.",
      "Yet officials say there's reason to be optimistic. Carr highlighted improvement in Louisiana, where fourth grade reading is now back above pre-pandemic levels, and in Alabama, which accomplished that feat in fourth grade math.",
      "Carr was especially laudatory of Louisiana, where a campaign to improve reading proficiency resulted in both higher- and lower-performing students exceeding 2019 scores.",
      "\"I would not say that hope is lost, and I would not say that we cannot turn this around,\" Carr said. \"It's been demonstrated that we can.\"",

      "President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aimed at cutting federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under age 19, his latest move to roll back protections for transgender people across the country.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order says.",
      "The order covers gender-affirming care that includes puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care and calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.",
      "Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care. The new order suggests that the practice could end, and targets hospitals and universities that receive federal money and provide the care.",
      "The language in the executive order \u2014 using words such as \"maiming,\" \"sterilizing\" and \"mutilation\" \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. It also labels guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health as \"junk science.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump called gender-affirming care \"barbaric medical procedures.\"",
      "Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to care.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.",
      "\"It is deeply unfair to play politics with people's lives and strip transgender young people, their families and their providers of the freedom to make necessary health care decisions,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson.",
      "The order encourages Congress to adopt a law allowing those who receive gender-affirming care and come to regret it, or their parents, to sue the providers.",
      "It also directs the Justice Department to prioritize investigating states that protect access to gender-affirming care and \"facilitate stripping custody from parents\" who oppose the treatments for their children.

      "\"I'll always support my child's needs, regardless of what policies may be in place or what may come ... even if it meant trouble for me,\" Lee Garrett said.",

      "The push is the latest by Mr. Trump to reverse Biden administration policies protecting transgender people and their care. On Monday, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct a review that is likely to lead to them being barred from military service.",
      "That order's language stated that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that soldiers who do so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",

The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Hours after taking office last week, Mr. Trump signed another order that seeks to define sex as only male or female, not recognizing transgender, nonbinary or intersex people or the idea that gender can be fluid. Already that's resulted in the State Department halting issuing passports with an \"X\" gender marker, forcing transgender people to apply for travel documents with markers that don't match their identities.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would address these issues during his campaign last year, and his actions could prove widely divisive.",
      "In the November election, voters were slightly more likely to oppose than support laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors under the age of 18 who identify as transgender, according to AP VoteCast. About half of voters, 52%, were opposed, but 47% said they were in favor.",
      "Mr. Trump's voters were much more likely to support bans on transgender care: About 6 in 10 Trump voters favored such laws.",
      "\"It's very clear that this order, in combination with the other orders that we've seen over the past week, are meant to not protect anyone in this country, but rather to single-mindedly drive out transgender people of all ages from all walks of civic life,\" said Harper Seldin, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.",
      "Seldin said the ACLU is reviewing the order \"to understand what, if anything, has immediate effect versus what needs to go through continued agency action.\"",
      "Even as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts, they've become major targets for social conservatives. In recent years, at least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Most of those states face lawsuits, including one over Tennessee's ban that's pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",

      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",
      "A Crew Dragon that will be used for a commercial space tourism flight around Earth's poles this spring is not believed to be an option because it is not equipped with a space station docking mechanism.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of senior staff inside the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, have been placed on administrative leave until further notice, and hundreds of contractors have had their employment furloughed or terminated, multiple sources told CBS News. This followed Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order last Friday that placed an immediate halt on virtually all U.S.-funded foreign aid assistance globally.",
      "CBS News spoke to a dozen current and former USAID staff and contractors who were granted anonymity to speak openly.",
      "An email obtained by CBS News and sent from USAID's acting administrator Jason Gray to USAID staff Monday stated that \"a number of USAID employees\" were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice after \"several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President's Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people\" were identified.",
      "Approximately 60 senior staff within USAID have been suspended \u2014 including the assistant administrators and deputy assistant administrators heading up most of its bureaus \u2014 leaving the agency without clear leadership, five sources familiar with the internal action told CBS News. The majority of those placed on leave were career civil servants and foreign service officers. They also included USAID attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel, who are responsible for interpreting the executive orders for implementation.",
      "One source told CBS News the individuals affected were told to \"go home and not communicate with anyone\" at USAID. Two sources told CBS News that some of the individuals in question were physically escorted out of the building.",
      "CBS News has also learned that several hundred contractors at USAID have been furloughed or laid off, according to six sources familiar with the action. Some have been notified they have been terminated immediately without severance pay and that their benefits will expire in just three days, at the end of January, while others who have been furloughed have been told their benefits will remain in effect through the end of February.",
      "Rubio's order is part of an effort by the administration to meet President Trump's campaign promises of shrinking the size of the federal workforce, and looking for places to cut what it sees as wasteful government spending. Mr. Trump has long held that other nations are not contributing enough when it comes to foreign aid, and that the U.S. is bearing the brunt of the burden. But critics say such cuts could undermine America's standing in the world and create an opening for China and other adversaries looking to exert their influence abroad.",
      "In response to Rubio's mandate to halt federal foreign assistance, stop-work orders were issued on Monday and Tuesday to companies that hold contracts with USAID and the State Department.",
      "Termination letters sent to two contractors obtained by CBS News read, \"This letter is to inform you that effective January 28, 2025, your employment with [federal contract holder] will be terminated due to a contract layoff. Unfortunately, [federal contract holder] received a Stop Work Order, and without authority to proceed, we have no work for you to perform.\"",
      "There is language in the termination letters reading, \"We hope this situation is temporary and that you can return to your positions.\" However, the employees' email accounts with USAID and the contracting company were shut off, and the termination letters were sent afterwards to their personal emails, sources said.",
      "One source said that USAID staff had scrambled to put forward applications for waivers for programs once Rubio had sent out the order.",
      "\"Then they physically escorted out USAID leadership. The waiver process was a joke,\" the source said.",
      "\"USAID is absolutely gutted,\" another source in the agency said. \"This is surgical to stop programs. Lives are at stake here. We are jeopardizing lives.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters late Tuesday that \"staff have been given a template for waiver requests.\"",
      "Rubio, later on Tuesday, then issued a waiver to his own foreign assistance pause. In a second memo provided to CBS by a senior administration official, Rubio stated the waiver applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance\", which he defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "The memo also stated, \"Implementers of existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work if they have stopped.\"",
      "The new waiver does not apply to \"activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, gender or DEl ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,\" per the memo.",
      "The State Department has not yet provided clarification on whether some U.S.-funded foreign aid programs are now automatically exempt as a result of Rubio's new waiver, or whether all programs globally must still apply for a waiver in order to opt back into receiving U.S. funding.",
      "It is not immediately clear how this new waiver will impact those whose employment has already been terminated.",
      "In the copy of Rubio's initial order obtained by CBS News last Friday, he told all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders \"for existing foreign assistance awards,\" pending review by the Secretary of State.",
      "Rubio had also stated in his initial order that \"exceptions\" to the pause approved by the State Department Director of Foreign Assistance Office are also exempt, without further specifying what those exceptions are. CBS News has learned that Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon, is now serving in a senior directing role within the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office \u2014 known internally as 'F' \u2014 which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "\"I'm so devastated [as] to what just took place,\" one impacted USAID source said. \"We enjoyed the work we'd done and how it contributed to helping people all over the world. What took place was not fair at all. This has never taken place in any administration change, ever,\" they said, adding that they had respected the change and had been \"looking forward to building a relationship with the new administration for the better good.\"",
      "Two now-former USAID contractors voiced deep concerns about having life-threatening health conditions, in one case exacerbated by frequent work travel, and suddenly finding themselves without medical insurance after the end of the month on Friday.",
      "\"Our contractor could have paid us for two weeks. Or at least through next week so that we could have health insurance through February,\" says another USAID contractor whose employment was terminated on Tuesday. \"It feels apocalyptic. Every email felt like a threat starting last week and then they followed through.\" The source added that in their office on Monday and Tuesday \"people were in disarray and bawling\u2026People are terrified. Direct hires are feeling intense survivor's guilt and don't know what to do.\"",
      "A number of USAID contractors were also terminated last week without being placed on leave or receiving severance as a result of the executive order targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs. This included individuals who were not DEI advisers, or did not have primary job functions related to DEI, but may have contributed to collective workplace efforts focused on inclusivity and accessibility in the Biden administration.",
      "Termination letters sent to those employees last Thursday evening read, \"Effective immediately, USAID no longer requires the services you currently perform on the contract. As of today, USAID is ending funding for this position.\"",
      "Multiple sources also told CBS News that in several Washington, D.C.-based USAID annex office buildings, photographs hanging up of the agencies' programs and beneficiaries have been stripped from the walls. The removal of photographs is \"not normal protocol\" between administrations, one source said.",
      "\"They're physically dismantling things in the building,\" a second source said. \"They're erasing our existence,\" said a third.",
      "Contractors with USAID's Bureau for Global Health \u2014 the department responsible for projects covering HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child health, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases \u2014 were among those who received termination notices on Tuesday. According to two sources, all contractors in the Global Health Bureau, roughly 450 technical experts, were terminated. Those contractors make up about 50% of the entire USAID global health staff, leaving only about 450 direct hires still employed in that bureau.",
      "The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR \u2014 started by the administration of George W. Bush in 2003 \u2014 is among the notable government programs suddenly brought to a halt since Rubio issued the order, potentially interrupting the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions of HIV and AIDS patients globally.\u00a0 According to the State department, PEPFAR has saved the lives of 26 million people since it started.",
      "While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there is also growing concern among advocates that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation earlier this month that groups receiving aid performed abortions, which is a violation of U.S. law. Reuters reported that four nurses in Mozambique had performed 21 abortions since 2021. That revelation may also be part of the upcoming State Department review.",
      "Currently 20.6 million people globally are on life-saving drugs due to PEPFAR, one source told CBS News, so the freeze in U.S. aid funding could lead to \"hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly for women and children, depending on the length of the freeze.\"",
      "\"This is a crime against humanity,\" the source added.",
      "\"This purge is unprecedented, is a threat to our national security, makes America less safe, and seems [to be] circumventing congressional authority,\" one former USAID employee said.",
      "\"To me, this is an unmitigated hostile takeover of our democracy,\" another source impacted by the federal assistance freeze said. \"USAID is just the first casualty. But more are coming imminently. With the intention to wield power for whatever purposes they feel like.\"",

    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday has ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze\u00a0as she considers arguments from the U.S. government and the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid are excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",

      "The Department of Defense said it approved a request from ICE for facilities inside the Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, to be converted into temporary staging and detention sites for migrants in the U.S. illegally who are facing deportation.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a Department of Defense spokesperson said the base is expected to house migrants with criminal records arrested during \"an operation taking place in Colorado.\" ICE officials and other law enforcement authorities \u2014 and not military personnel \u2014 will administer the migrant detainee facilities, the spokesperson added.",
      "\"ICE requirements for the facility include a temporary operations center, staging area, and a temporary holding location for the receiving, holding, and processing of illegal aliens,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The move is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to vastly expand the role the military plays in border and immigration enforcement. Through an emergency declaration, President Trump has deployed an additional 1,500 Army soldiers and Marines to the southern border, with instructions to erect barriers and assist Customs and Border Protection officials.",
      "Under federal law dating back to the Reconstruction Era, the military is generally barred from engaging in civilian law enforcement, which would include processing migrants.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed the Pentagon to use military planes to deport migrants who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unlawfully. On Tuesday, a U.S. military plane deported dozens of migrants to Ecuador. Last week, the U.S. used military aircraft to carry out deportations to Guatemala.",
      "The military's role in Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown could expand further. An internal CBP memo obtained by CBS News indicates the administration has considered sending as many as 10,000 troops to the southern border and using more military installations for migrant detention.",
      "The decision to use a Space Force base in Aurora to hold unauthorized migrants is also noteworthy given the expected ramp-up in ICE activity in and near that Denver suburb.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News Tuesday that the Denver area is among the next targets for the stepped-up immigration arrest operations that ICE has been conducting under the Trump administration.",
      "During Mr. Trump's early days in office, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, targeting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records and those who had been issued deportation orders. But others in the U.S. illegally have also been swept up in the operations, since Biden-era limits on immigration enforcement have been revoked.",
      "Large ICE operations have already been conducted in Chicago and New York City, and the agency is expected to do the same in the Denver-area communities like Aurora, which the president frequently cited on the campaign trail when vowing to crack down on illegal immigration. The Colorado city gained national attention over concerns about the presence of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua.",
      "What will happen to Tren de Aragua members who are arrested is unclear, as Venezuela currently rejects U.S. deportations. However, CBS News reported Sunday that the Trump administration is considering an agreement with El Salvador that would allow the U.S. to deport suspected Tren de Aragua gangsters to that small Central American country, which has overseen a mass incarceration effort against gangs.",

      "Inside the ICE field office in Manhattan on Tuesday, the agency's ranks were enlarged by other agencies, including Noem, now ordered by the Trump administration. The plan was to carry out multiple predawn raids targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal records, with charges ranging from murder to theft to kidnapping. The short-term goal is 500 arrests over a weeklong operation in New York.",
      "One of the targets of Tuesday's raids was a Venezuelan national and suspected gang member wanted out of Colorado on multiple felony warrants for kidnapping, burglary and a gun crime, according to authorities.",
      "Around 5:30 a.m., heavily armed agents raided an apartment building in the Bronx and found the suspect and three other male associates. They were all handcuffed without incident. Three children were also found in the apartment, but their immigration status was not immediately known. Authorities will now check to see if they have a caregiver or if Child Protective Services needs to be brought in.",
      "The next stop was a residence less than two miles away. After some negotiation, the officers made their way inside, but came up empty because their targets weren't home.",

      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",
      "\"There's a fair number of animals in the U.S. that have never had their photos taken, or there are very little or poor quality photos,\" Jain said, adding that he hopes to continue taking photos of wildlife to aid conservation efforts.",
      "In addition to helping raise awareness about the small mammals facing threats from climate change \u2014 with 89% projected loss of its habitat by the 2080s, according to UC Berkeley \u2014 the students said the photos will be entered into scientific databases, and they will help make it easier for researchers to identify species of the shrews.",
      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",

      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin healthcare systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",

      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",

      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",

    "title": "Here's the financial impact of the Fed's expected pause on rate cuts",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:41:02 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed is expected to hold off on another rate cut at its Jan. 29 meeting. Here's what it means for your finances.",
    "story": [
      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is expected to hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, according to more than 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data site FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "A January pause would mark an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed signaled that it expects fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. On top of that, economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about a rate pause by the fed.",
      "When does the Fed make its next rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29, followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "But a pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "Though Democrats have criticized the court for attempting to punish Israeli officials, those opposed to the bill have argued that the measure is too broad and could lead to consequences penalizing those it does not intend to target, such as U.S. technology companies who provide services to the ICC but have no role in making\u00a0investigative or prosecutorial decisions.",

      "A civilian jet broke the sound barrier for the first time Tuesday while making a historic test flight over the Mojave Desert.",
      "The XB-1 aircraft, manufactured by Boom Supersonic, was piloted by Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg, the company said in a news release. The plane, nicknamed \"Baby Boom,\" took off from Mojave Air and Space Port and reached an altitude of 35,290 feet before accelerating to Mach 1.122, the company said. That speed is equivalent to 750 miles per hour.",
      "It marks the first time an independently developed jet has broken the sound barrier, Boom Supersonic said, and the plane is the \"first supersonic jet made in America.\" The sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947, when Air Force pilot Capt. Chuck Yeager flew a rocket-propelled experimental aircraft across the Mojave Desert -- taking off from the Mojave Air and Space Port just as the XB-1 did.",
      "Before today's sound barrier-breaking flight, the XB-1 underwent 11 test flights. The aircraft includes features like an augmented reality system to make takeoff and landing easier and has a long nose that makes it easier for pilots to see the runway during those stages. The jet's aerodynamics are based off thousands of simulations, the company said, creating a design that it says \"combines safe and stable operation at takeoff and landing with efficiency at supersonic speeds.\" The jet is also made almost entirely from carbon fiber composite materials, which create a \"strong, lightweight structure.\"",
      "The company will next focus its attention on Overture, a supersonic airliner that will ultimately \"bring the benefits of supersonic flight to everyone,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a statement. The XB-1 jet will be the foundation for Overture, Boom Supersonic said, and many features present on the jet will also be incorporated into the supersonic airliner. The airliner will also use Boom Supersonic's bespoke propulsion system, Symphony, to run on \"up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel.\"",
      "The company said the goal for the plane is for it to be able to carry between 64 and 80 passengers at Mach 1.7, or about 1,295 miles per hour. Existing subsonic airliners fly at between 550 and 600 miles per hour, according to charter company Bitlux.",

    "story": [
      "The mystery of the unexplained drone sightings over New Jersey and along the East Coast late last year has been solved, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who said she was relaying the update directly from President Trump in the Oval Office.",
      "In her first White House press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said, \"After research and study, the drones that were flying over New Jersey in large numbers were authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.\"",
      "\"Many of these drones were also hobbyists, recreational and private individuals that enjoy flying drones,\" she added. \"In time, it got worse due to curiosity. This was not the enemy.\"",
      "In December,\u00a0mysterious drone sightings\u00a0in\u00a0New Jersey,\u00a0New York,\u00a0Pennsylvania and other East Coast states prompted a demand for officials\u00a0to find the source\u00a0of the\u00a0flying objects, some of which were spotted near military installations.",
      "The FBI was the lead agency investigating the sightings and said it received several thousand tips. Local law enforcement agencies also investigated.",
      "On social media, users shared theories that range from foreign interference to UFOs to hobbyist activity.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security said there was no evidence\" the reported drone sightings posed a threat to national security or public safety or had any foreign connection.",
      "But state and local leaders were pushed to find more information and come up with a stronger response.",
      "Authorities said many of the reported drone sightings could be aircraft or helicopters operating from the region's numerous airports. New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim said in posts on X that he \"concluded that most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes.\"",
      "As Leavitt said Tuesday, former White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in December that many reports were determined to be \"a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones.\"",
      "Some social media users had suggested they might shoot down the drones if they came too close to their homes, and in December, Mr. Trump also suggested shooting down the drones, though he did not clarify who should take such action.",

    "summary": "Judges heard nearly four hours of arguments over whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had the authority to unwind plea deals reached with three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Department lawyers and defense attorneys for the three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks squared off before a federal appeals court Tuesday in a court fight over whether plea agreements reached with the defendants last summer can go forward.",
      "A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is considering whether former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin exceeded his authority when he revoked the pretrial agreements that military prosecutors reached with the defendants, including alleged Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.",
      "The deals with Mohammed and two alleged accomplices, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak bin 'Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi, were agreed to in late July following more than two years of negotiations. The agreements were approved by a senior Pentagon official who oversees the military court at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Brigadier General Susan Escallier, who Austin designated as convening authority for military commissions in 2023.",
      "Under the terms that have been released publicly, the men would plead guilty to eight charges arising from their alleged roles in the 9/11 terror attacks and in exchange, avoid the death penalty. The full parameters of the deals remain under seal.",
      "But shortly after the agreement was announced, Austin said he was rescinding them, writing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the pretrial deals, \"responsibility for such a decision should rest with me.\"",
      "The case arrived before the D.C. Circuit after a military commission judge in Guantanamo Bay, who has been overseeing the case, ruled in November that Austin's nullification was unlawful, rendering the agreements valid and enforceable.",
      "A military appeals court last month declined to let Austin rescind the pretrial agreements because the defendants had begun performing a promise contained in them.",
      "The U.S. government then asked the D.C. Circuit to step in and sought to stop the military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from accepting the agreements, as well as pause proceedings. The appeals court earlier this month agreed to put the plea hearing on hold and set arguments in the case on an expedited basis.",
      "The Justice Department is asking the D.C. Circuit to find that Austin validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements and bar the military commission from conducting plea hearings, during which the defendants would enter guilty pleas.",
      "\"We think this is the circumstance to issue the writ and effectuate and allow the secretary of defense's determinations to govern the course of the prosecutions of the alleged mastermind of 9/11 and the two alleged co-conspirators,\" Melissa Patterson, a Justice Department lawyer, told the three-judge panel.",
      "Judges Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Neomi Rao heard nearly four hours of arguments over Austin's decision to unwind the deals.",
      "Patterson revealed to the judges that as proceedings were getting underway, the military judge in Guantanamo Bay said he would begin taking the pleas from the three defendants Thursday morning if the D.C. Circuit denied relief to the government.",
      "She asked the court to leave its earlier order pausing proceedings in place if it sides with the 9/11 defendants to allow the Justice Department time to evaluate whether it should seek further review.",
      "Across the arguments, the judges peppered Patterson with questions as to why Austin waited until two days after the plea deals were reached to withdraw Escallier's authority to enter into the agreements and assume that power for himself.",
      "Austin could have placed limits on Escallier's ability to enter the pleas from the beginning, Rao, appointed by President Trump during his first term, said. She later acknowledged that the circumstances of the case and the government's interest are \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The judge said the executive branch had \"every opportunity\" and the power to take actions to exercise control over Escallier, the convening authority, before the agreements were reached.",
      "Millett, named to the D.C. Circuit by former President Barack Obama, said Austin's revocation of the deals two days after the offers were signed put \"all these courts into knots\" trying to figure out the next steps.",
      "The judges also weighed whether Austin missed his window to rescind the agreements altogether, as the rules governing military commissions allow the convening authority \u2014 defined as the secretary of defense or an official designed by the secretary \u2014 to withdraw from a deal at any time before a defendant begins performance of promises contained in them.",
      "\"It undermines the force and plausibility of your argument that the secretary was being prudent by waiting,\" Wilkins said, noting that there are events that could take place that would take away his authority to withdraw the deals.",
      "Michel Paradis, who is representing Mohammed in the case, said it is \"not appropriate\" for the government to ask the D.C. Circuit to \"save itself\" from a pretrial agreement that it entered into, and the defendants began to perform.",
      "The defense secretary, he said, had plenty of opportunities over a span of several years to know about and prevent the deals, but chose not to exercise his authority over the convening authority until two days after the offers were signed.",
      "It's unclear how soon the D.C. Circuit will issue its decision.",

    "story": [
      "Google Maps users in the United States can expect to see the body of water known for centuries as the Gulf of Mexico renamed the Gulf of America, aligning with the terms of President Trump's controversial executive order. Google also said Denali, a mountain in southern Alaska and North America's tallest peak, is going to be called Mount McKinley on its maps for those same users, reflecting the presidential mandate.",
      "The changes will not take effect until the government updates those site listings in the Geographic Names Information System, an official database that includes descriptions and location information for millions of places within the U.S. As of Tuesday morning, the Gulf of Mexico and Denali still appear as such in the directory.",
      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "In a news release, the agency said the changes \"reaffirm the Nation's commitment to preserving the extraordinary heritage of the United States and ensuring that future generations of Americans celebrate the legacy of its heroes and historic assets.\" The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was set to begin updating \"the official federal nomenclature in the Geographic Names Information System to reflect these changes, effective immediately for federal use,\" the department added.",
      "Although the federal government will formally reference both the Gulf and the mountain by their new names \u2014 in government documents and official U.S. maps, for example \u2014 other nations are not required recognize them. The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president. The name was changed formally to Denali by former President Barack Obama during his administration.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Local officials in Samoa don't blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's HHS pick, for measles deaths, but critics call his actions \"harmful.\"",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. senators grill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week, President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to face sharp questions about his actions in an island nation half a world away.",
      "Kennedy's 2019 visit to Samoa has recently brought fresh attention to his history of activism focused on raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine \u2014 because his trip came just months before a devastating measles outbreak that claimed 83 lives, many of them young children.",
      "\"It was very sad,\" Dr. Take Naseri, Samoa's health chief at the time, told CBS News. \"It's one of those things you don't want to revisit.\"",
      "Kennedy has maintained that he had \"nothing to do\" with the people of Samoa resisting vaccines.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 19:42:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, geopolitics and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The directive to the CDC to halt communications with the World Health Organization was imposed to comply with President Trump's executive order.",
    "story": [
      "Staff across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were ordered Monday to cut off all communications with the World Health Organization, multiple federal health officials confirmed to CBS News, to comply with President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "Beyond calling for the U.S. to begin the yearlong process to formally withdraw from funding the U.N. health agency, Mr. Trump's executive order had also instructed federal agencies to \"recall and reassign\" any U.S. government personnel from working with the WHO.",
      "The sweeping directive to implement the order was issued by the CDC's Deputy Director for Global Health John Nkengasong in an email Monday, one official said, pending further guidance for when and how exceptions might be carved out.",
      "CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO are also being told not to come into the office, the email said, pending further guidance from leadership.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been critical of the WHO, blaming the organization for mishandling COVID-19 and saying it gets too much money from the U.S., which donates the most of any country.",
      "At an event in Las Vegas on Jan. 25, he said the WHO had offered to cut the U.S. funding commitment down to around the amount given by China.",
      "\"Maybe we would consider doing it again. I don't know. Maybe we would. They have to clean it up a little bit,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Former health officials tell CBS News they worry the U.S. withdrawal from the WHO could endanger efforts to respond to diseases, both undermining the U.N. agency and also making it harder for American officials to prepare.",
      "The first way U.S. officials would sometimes hear about worrying outbreaks was through the WHO, especially in countries wary of working with American authorities. The WHO also relies on disease experts dispatched by the U.S. and other countries to fill its ranks.",
      "\"As has been repeated many times, infectious diseases know no boundaries and in today's world of rapid travel, an outbreak anywhere is a threat everywhere,\" said James LeDuc, an adjunct professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch.",
      "Between working for the U.S. Army's medical research and heading the Galveston National Laboratory, LeDuc worked for CDC as a WHO medical officer and later one of the agency's top-ranking global health officials.",
      "\"The fact is that there is no alternative to WHO. WHO has the global mandate that allows health issues to be addressed on a global scale in a coordinated manner,\" LeDuc said.",
      "A World Health Organization spokesperson declined to comment on the move. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Preparing for seasonal and pandemic influenza",
      "The gag order comes ahead of a key committee meeting next month, where CDC officials were scheduled to help the WHO pick out strains for next winter's influenza vaccine.",
      "Influenza vaccine manufacturers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration rely on the data and findings by that panel to decide on the shots used every fall around the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "The CDC also plays a key role as a WHO \"collaborating center\" for flu, serving as one of the world's one of the world's top laboratories for testing and studying the virus.",
      "Many countries send samples of worrying influenza cases to the CDC's Atlanta laboratory for scrutiny of mutations that might pose a pandemic threat, like after deaths from bird flu or swine flu.",
      "Responding to viruses like polio and Marburg",
      "CDC staff assigned to work for the WHO often serve as liaisons with the agency's disease experts, offering insights into worrying new germs the WHO is responding to around the world.",
      "Others work with other countries to stomp out lingering diseases, like the Global Polio Eradication Initiative backed by both agencies.",
      "The WHO also plays a key role in issuing licenses and coordinating trials that allow for the use of medicines to respond to diseases, especially for smaller countries facing outbreaks of new diseases.",
      "Multiple former federal health officials said the WHO also played a key role in facilitating the response and rollout of a U.S. vaccine to respond to an outbreak of Marburg, an Ebola-like disease, in Rwanda last year.",
      "Authorities are closely watching another outbreak of Marburg this year in Tanzania, which the WHO announced confirming last week.",
      "Replacing U.S. expertise at the WHO",
      "\"The expertise provided by CDC and other U.S. government agencies is absolutely essential to the success of WHO activities and to the well-being of the United States,\" said LeDuc.",
      "LeDuc recalled that U.S. staff were once proud to don WHO uniforms, working steps away from scientists from former Cold War adversaries to stem emerging disease threats out of the international organization's Geneva office.",
      "\"I don't think we want, particularly as public health experts, to feel like they can only wave the U.S. flag in those positions. The reason why it worked is because we were able to be American and also to be global citizens,\" said Loyce Pace, director of global affairs for HHS under the Biden administration.",
      "Pace said there are hundreds of American health agency officials who work with the WHO. She said it is likely other countries will likely try to step to fill the void left by American public health officials.",
      "Another former federal official said China has been seeking to fill more posts within the U.N. agency, worrying some U.S. officials about how they may seek to use their positions.",
      "\"My hope is that there's a part of us that will continue to work to see that not as a weakness but as a strength, to distinguish us from other actors who don't have that approach and, frankly, have not been as effective in building partnerships to protect the world,\" said Pace.",

      "The Doomsday clock was set at 89 seconds to midnight on Tuesday morning, putting it the closest the world has ever been to what scientists deem \"global catastrophe.\"",
      "The decades-old international symbol, described by the University of Chicago-based nonprofit the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists as a metaphor that shows how close the planet is to reaching \"human extinction,\" is set every year. In January 2024, the clock was set at 90 seconds to midnight, the same as it was in 2023. This is the first time the clock has moved forward since 2023.",
      "The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists tracks man-made threats and focuses on three main hazard areas \u2014 nuclear risk, climate change and disruptive technologies \u2014 to determine the clock's placement. The clock's position this year was set based on \"nuclear weapons threats, the climate crisis, biological threats, and disruptive technologies like artificial intelligence,\" according to a press release from the Bulletin.",
      "\"We set the clock closer to midnight because we do not see sufficient positive progress on the global challenges we face, including nuclear risk, climate change, biological threats and advances in disruptive technologies,\" said Daniel Holz, the chair of the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, which sets the clock, in a news conference Thursday.",
      "Special guest Juan Manuel Santos, former president of Colombia and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, emphasized that the clock's forward movement could be stopped, but only if world leaders worked together. He highlighted President Trump's vow to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization as steps in the wrong direction.",
      "\"We can only succeed if we act as one,\" Santos said.",
      "Other board members pointed to growing nuclear capabilities, proposals to integrate artificial intelligence into military functions, and disinformation online as major man-made threats.",
      "\"The 2025 Clock time signals that the world is on a course of unprecedented risk, and that continuing on the current path is a form of madness,\" the Bulletin said. \"The United States, China, and Russia have the prime responsibility to pull the world back from the brink. The world depends on immediate action.\"",
      "The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was founded in 1945 by Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and University of Chicago scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The Bulletin created the Doomsday Clock two years later to convey man-made threats to human existence and the planet. The Clock has become a universally recognized indicator of the world's vulnerability to global catastrophe.",
      "The Science and Security Board, made up of scientists, nuclear technology and climate science experts, and members of organization's sponsoring board, meets twice a year to \"discuss world events and reset the clock as necessary,\"\u00a0according to its website.",
      "The Doomsday clock was established in 1947, according to the Bulletin's website, by scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project. Then, the rise of nuclear weapons technology was believed to be the world's greatest threat, with early versions of the clock warning of the risk of the arms race between the U.S. and Soviet Union. Since 2007, climate change has been a leading concern that determines the placement of the clock.",
      "The clock was initially set at seven minutes to midnight and has moved 25 times since then. It can move backwards and forwards, with movement away from midnight showing that people can make positive change. The hands were furthest from midnight in 1991, following the end of the Cold War, according to the Bulletin.",

      "The United Nations estimates that about 200,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to the shattered northern part of the Gaza Strip since Israel authorized their movement on Monday. CBS News' team in Gaza followed one man among the masses making the trek back home, to see what was left of his life before the war.",
      "Men, women, children and even entire families set off as soon as the Israeli military pulled its troops out and opened the road stretching from north to south along Gaza's Mediterranean coast for the first time in more than a year.",
      "Since Monday, the coast road has been a slow-flowing river of people on the move, most of them unsure what 15 months of bombing and warfare has left of their neighborhoods.",
      "As the displaced make their way back north, carrying what few belongings they can, Hamas fighters have kept watch, and they've been on a charm offensive.",
      "It was their brutal Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the devastating war. But their visible presence throughout Gaza also makes the point that, despite Israel's stated goal of destroying the group with its counterattack, Hamas remains not only there, but in charge.",
      "Among the thousands walking up the dusty coast road on Monday was Monzer al-Sharafi, who had spent months in a tent with many members of his family.",
      "\"Life in the tent is unbearable. It is painful and saddening,\" he told CBS News as his daughter helped him gather a few belongings for the long walk back north. \"In the summer, we are baked like in an oven, and in winter, we feel like we are in a freezer.\"",
      "Still, as he left his loved ones behind, al-Sharafi was apprehensive.",
      "\"I will check what is going on and come back,\" he said, kissing his daughter. \"Inshallah, everything will be alright.\"",
      "\"It is mixed feelings,\" he said, \"but I am dancing with joy. I wonder if my house is still standing or not. I am going to meet my parents there. I haven't seen them for 15 months. I've been in the south and they've been in the north. I am excited, but I still have mixed feelings... it's the sadness we've endured, and it's the joy of meeting our loved ones and stopping the bloodbath in Gaza.\"",
      "He met some old friends along the way, and they all seemed amazed and overjoyed to find themselves and each other alive.",
      "But the joy of the three-hour homeward walk was tempered by the destruction all around al-Sharafi along the coast road. It did nothing to ease the anxiety over what was waiting at the end of the journey.",
      "\"What is all this destruction? Our beautiful Gaza is no longer pretty. The IDF destroyed everything\u2026 They destroyed the trees, the buildings, and the human beings,\" he told CBS News. \"I see destruction everywhere I look. I can't recognize the streets and my way in Gaza. I feel like I am a foreigner. It feels like I left Gaza for 15 years, not 15 months.\"",
      "At last, he reached his old neighborhood in the city of Jabalia. He bent down to kiss the ground, but al-Sharafi said he couldn't believe his eyes at the level of destruction.",
      "He did, however, find his parents, alive and as well as could be expected. It was his father who delivered the gut-punch, when al-Sharafi said he wanted to go and find his apartment building.",
      "\"It is completely flattened, to the ground now,\" his father told him.",
      "\"It doesn't matter, you are safe!\" consoled his mother.",
      "\"This is my where I spent my childhood, and my life,\" he told CBS News, looking at the spot where home had been. There was almost nothing left.",
      "\"This is my mattress and this is my sweater. This is my children's bag,\" he said, picking through the rubble.",

      "\"I left my family in the tent because I was certain the journey from the south to the north would be painful,\" he explained. \"I'd hoped to at least find a room still standing. Sadly, they are in a tent there, and I will bring them here to another tent. I will bring them from one hard place to another. I will take my daughter Lulu's teddy bear. This is the only thing left, and I will take it to our tent in the south.\"",

The AfD, which Musk had previously voiced his support for, has been labelled a suspected extremist organization by Germany's national security services.",

    "summary": "The FBI and NCIS say \"virtual espionage\" by China is ensnaring American troops in growing numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The Chinese intelligence officer who convinced Thomas Zhao to hand over sensitive information about the U.S. military seemed to know the 24-year-old U.S. Navy petty officer had a passion for the stock market.",
      "The agent approached Zhao in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat, CBS News learned in interviews with people involved in the case. But chats about investment strategies soon veered into sensitive areas, including questions about Naval exercises in the Pacific and designs for radar installations.",
      "The Zhao case represents a new dimension to Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice, in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them, is a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "\"They will turn over every stone to try and collect what they can,\" Kevin Vorndran, who leads the FBI's counterintelligence division, told CBS News in a rare television interview. \"They are certainly endeavoring to target as many people as they can.\"",
      "Over the course of two years, a Chinese intelligence officer paid Zhao, a U.S. citizen and Navy engineer, about $15,000 to take photographs and videos of restricted areas at the Southern California base where he worked, court records revealed.",
      "With his relatively low rank, as well as a low-level security clearance, Zhao may have seemed like an unlikely target. Yet Vorndran and other U.S. officials told CBS News that intelligence officers working for the Chinese government are trolling professional networking sites, including LinkedIn, to seduce an array of American service members and others who hold U.S. government security clearances into turning over sensitive information.",
      "\"On professional networking sites, members of the military, former members of the military, list their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\" Vorndran said. \"It exposes their expertise. And through that, it makes targeting by an intelligence service simple to accomplish.\"",
      "A LinkedIn spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Chinese intelligence officers were using the platform to identify potential targets, but did say in a statement that fraudulent accounts violate the company's terms of service.",
      "\"Our teams use a variety of automated technologies, combined with a team of trained investigation experts and member reporting, to help stop bad actors and to keep experiences on LinkedIn professional,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The tactic is low risk and high reward \u2014 a hallmark of the kind of \"virtual espionage\" China began leaning on when COVID made it more difficult for spies to travel abroad, according to counterintelligence officials.",
      "\"The intelligence officer can sit behind their desk back in China and reach out to numerous individuals all at once,\" said Ryan Norris, a special agent with the Navy's Criminal Investigative Service. \"They are reaching out to as many people as possible and hoping to get some response.\"",
      "In the last two years, federal law enforcement has identified a dozen such cases and brought charges against four service members recruited by suspected undercover agents of China. Vorndran said given the difficulty in policing this kind of outreach, he's concerned the number could be far higher.",
      "\"We investigate everyone we can identify and predicate an investigation on,\" said Vorndran. \"The ones that we don't know are the ones that concern me and keep me up.\"",
      "A spokesperson for China's embassy denied knowledge of the Zhao case, and did not address a question about whether its intelligence officers were contacting U.S. servicemembers online and soliciting sensitive information.",
      "\"China hopes that the United States will stop hyping up the so-called 'Chinese espionage' risk and stop exaggerating the 'China threat theory,' and inject more stability into Sino-US relations instead of setting up obstacles,\" the embassy spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Easy money",
      "In August 2023, agents with the FBI and NCIS descended on the Ventura County Naval Base, apprehended Zhao, and took him into a small room for questioning. A video of the interrogation, obtained by CBS News, shows Zhao admitting he sent sensitive military information to an individual he met online.",
      "While Zhao said the individual seemed \"fishy,\" it does not appear he knew he was dealing with a Chinese intelligence officer. And while he considered passing along photographs of what he was working on as an easy way to make money, he stopped short of sending any classified information.",
      "\"When I tried to cut off the relationship with him, it's already kinda late,\" Zhao said in the interrogation, telling the federal agents he felt \"trapped.\"",
      "Following the interrogation, Zhao was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to bribery and conspiracy charges, and is currently serving a 27-month federal sentence. Prosecutors determined his actions did not rise to the level of espionage. Still, Norris said he believes Zhao's actions amount to a betrayal.",
      "\"He absolutely betrayed his country,\" said Norris, who questioned Zhao during the interrogation. \"I think over the past two years he'd had a relationship that he knew was nefarious, and I think he was finally caught in what he was doing.\"",
      "Tarek Shawky, Zhao's attorney, said his client was also to some degree a victim of a scam. He said their social media conversations revealed the Chinese intelligence officer sought to build up a level of trust before asking for sensitive information.",
      "\"At a certain point, I think the human condition is that you want to suspend a little bit of your better judgment because of that human connection,\" Shawky said. \"That's what makes it so dangerous.\"",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Zhao's wife Jianyu Ren said her husband acknowledged making a mistake, but she denied he would ever willfully sell out his country.",
      "\"That's not him,\" Ren said. \"If he had known this person was working for the Chinese government or anybody in China, he wouldn't have done that.\"",

      "The gigantic wall of ice is moving slowly from Antarctica on a potential collision course with South Georgia, a crucial wildlife breeding ground in the South Atlantic.",
      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",

      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

      "The studio's actions - which included asking her to lose weight and subsequently gain some back, as well as writing jokes about her weight into the show - made it difficult for Gold to separate herself from her character. However, in the same way art influenced reality, Gold says it was her TV mother, Joanna Kerns, who would ultimately look out for her, pressuring the crew to help get her healthy.",
      "After three seasons, Gold noticed the writing on the show \"became a little edgier,\" as the program angled to \"be funnier\" and \"stay on top.\"",

      "A member of the cast, but only a child, Gold said she felt she did not have much say in the direction of her character. \"One thing you have to know about being a child actor. I always say this when I talk to kids who want to be child actors, I'm like, you have to be the best person on that set. You watch the adults messing up.

      "\"The ambiance on a set is that way. So when these jokes would come in, I really had no voice, so I would sort of just be like, I don't think I'm allowed to say anything. But I had power, a little bit, because Carol Seaver was all of a sudden, she was mine and I had created her and I was known for her, so all of a sudden I also felt protective of her a little bit.\"",
      "Gold said at the time, she was not hyper-fixated on her weight, so jokes were easier to accept, although after going on hiatus one summer, things changed. \"I came [back with] the freshman 15 basically, and then the jokes accelerated when I came back and became meaner,\" she recalled. \"It was out of my character to speak up, but it was hurting me, and I was sensitive to it. And I knew I had gained a little bit of weight, and I had never had that problem before.\"",

The set did have an element of misogyny to it because they're always bringing in the beautiful actress of the week \u2026 a few years older than me and coming in and, you know, dolling them up and sexualizing that and all of those things,\" she said. \"It was a boys club. It really was a boys club.\"",
      "\"They would say, you don't have any brothers, so you don't know what this is like. This is what brothers and sisters do to each other,\" said Gold, who grew up with four sisters. Although the jokes continued to hurt, \"It'd be like a joke like, \u2018Here comes wide load.\u2019 And you're not talking just about Carol anymore. You're talking about me, Tracey Gold. And now I have to be in front of an audience that's laughing at me and my body and my weight.\"",

Easily,\" she said. \"I did it and I did it quietly, and I didn't tell anyone I was doing it. I just went and did it. And all of a sudden, everybody's coming up to me on the set, you know, everywhere, kind of going, \u2018Oh my god, you look so good, you look so beautiful, you look so amazing.\u2019\"",

I don't think I wanted help at that point. I wanted to keep myself safe and protected. It was a self-coping mechanism to keep myself safe,\" she explained.",
      "\"I became very, very, very self-protective of myself and I kept continuing to lose weight. And I remember - and it was the irony of all ironies - they basically said to me, they called my dad once again, this is a few months later, and they say, 'We need Tracey to gain weight. She's getting too thin on camera. She's looking not healthy.'\"",

And they're like, \u2018Thank you. Thank you for looking after her. We're so worried about her.'\"",

      "Reasons for rising cases",
      "One in 45 adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with autism, Shih noted \u2014 more than ever before.",
      "\"Autism prevalence has risen due to increased public and professional awareness of autism, broader diagnostic criteria for autism, improved screening tools like the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), and standardized screening processes,\" he stated.",

      "Water is known to be a great resource for good health, but sparkling water could also offer unique benefits.",
      "A new report, published in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health, suggests that carbonated water may support weight loss by enhancing glucose uptake and metabolism in red blood cells.",
      "The researchers aimed to analyze the physiological effects of carbonated water, as it has been found to induce satiety (feelings of fullness) and gastric motility (movement of food through the body), both of which could reduce hunger.",
      "KELLY RIPA SAYS QUITTING ALCOHOL HAD A SURPRISING EFFECT ON HER WEIGHT",
      "In analyzing a study from 2004, the team found that carbonated water may support weight loss by converting to HCO3 \u2013 a byproduct of metabolism \u2013 in red blood cells and increasing energy production.",
      "Carbonated water that is high in sodium has also been shown to lower blood glucose levels, the report noted. (iStock)",
      "But the effect of this is \"so small,\" the researchers concluded, that it is \"difficult to expect weight loss effects solely from the CO2 in carbonated water.\"",

      "Study researcher Dr. Akira Takahashi, head of medicine at Tesseikai Neurosurgical Hospital in Osaka, Japan, conducted the original research 20 years ago.",

      "\"We know that we need more energy, not less, for our modern lifestyle, and all of the different emerging technologies, for example, United Power, they're actually my local electric co-op that supplies my energy, and United Power is forecasting a double to triple increase in the amount of power that they're going to need over the next 10 to 20 years, driven not only by population growth, but driven also by a lot of the new technologies that we're seeing,\" Evans told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Everybody knows about electric vehicles and the power that's required there, and so whether that's, you know, the switch to electric vehicles is driven by the free market or whether it's driven by some heavy-handed government mandates, if you plug in something into the power grid, we need more power, and we need to make sure that we have a more robust power grid to deliver that and that all ties back to baseline energy generation,\" he continued.",

And so really, our entire modern way of life revolves around energy and having more energy.\"",
      "Evans told Fox News Digital that the United States, particularly Colorado\u2019s 8th Congressional District which he represents, makes \"some of the cleanest and most environmentally responsible energy anywhere on the planet.\"",

The question that often doesn't come up in the space of electricity is what is the carbon footprint required to produce electricity? And in Colorado right now, the carbon footprint of our electrical grid is actually about 40% higher than the carbon footprint for pure natural gas,\" Evans explained.",
      "\"So if there is a natural gas school bus versus an electric school bus, if there's a natural gas RTD as in our local mass transit system in the Denver metro area, if we have a natural gas RTD bus versus an electric bus, the electric buses are actually contributing 40% more carbon to the atmosphere because of the carbon footprint required to generate and transmit that electricity than just pure natural gas.\"",

      "\"Chris Wright is the energy nominee, he's also from Colorado, and so we have a preexisting relationship based on my time in the state legislature where I was the ranking member on our State Energy and Environment Committee,\" Evans said. \"But we really do have to work hand-in-hand together, and I think the American people understand that, which is why the American people gave majorities in the House and the Senate and then obviously the presidency to my party, because they understand that we need to have a full court press to be able to deliver these solutions.\"",
      "Evans continued, \"And it's not just the House or the Senate or the presidency and the administration. We all have to be able to work together. And so being able to continue, you know, specifically in the energy space, the existing relationship that I have with some of these nominees is going to be critically important to achieving that ultimate goal of empowering energy producers, getting the good jobs that come from that industry, protecting our environment by actually producing responsible energy and then ultimately providing the good paying jobs that are so critical to solving the affordability crisis that we have right now.\"",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that the high prices of eggs is directly related to a lack of chicken supply which the Biden administration contributed to.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt urged members of Congress to confirm Trump's nominees to address problems like the U.S. egg shortage and the cost of living crisis.",
      "\"This is an example of why it's so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump's nominees, including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, who is already speaking with Kevin Hassett, who's leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country,\" Leavitt told reporters Tuesday at her first White House press briefing.",
      "\"We also have seen the cost of everything, not just eggs, bacon, groceries, gasoline, have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration,\" Leavitt said.",

      "In some states like California, those numbers have gone up to nearly $9 per dozen in certain areas. California, like other states including Arizona, Massachusetts and Michigan, requires all eggs sold in the state to come from cage-free hens, which typically are more expensive.",
      "The rise in egg prices comes amid high demand and a massive outbreak of avian flu, known as the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture attributes to killing more than 20 million egg-laying hens in the last quarter of 2024. All birds from an infected flock are culled, exacerbating the impact of the flu.",
      "Leavitt on Tuesday blamed this killing policy for contributing to the egg shortage.",
      "\"The Biden Administration\u2019s slow and ineffective response to the avian influenza outbreak, which began in 2022, has negatively impacted U.S. poultry producers, and his USDA forced farmers to massively cut their livestock populations,\" Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, said in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "As a result, Kelly said Trump and Rollins would\u00a0take \"bold, decisive action\" to address problems related to the avian flu, and direct the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to refocus on the health of animals and plants.",

      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card.

      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",

      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "A drop-down cover reveals the handlebars, while flip-up covers on the front and rear boxes provide small storage areas. While the Nomoto's primary appeal is its unique aesthetic, it's not just for show. The bike is a fully functional electric scooter, albeit a basic one.

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 10:00:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Many apps unrelated to location still ask users for tracking permission, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit seeking to end this alleged practice by Allstate.",
    "story": [
      "It's easier than you think to check for tracking software on your device. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson offers you some tips to help stay secure.",
      "Nowadays, almost every app you download asks for location permissions, meaning it wants to track where you are and your movements. For an app like Google Maps, requesting location access makes perfect sense. It's also reasonable for apps like Uber or DoorDash, which rely on location for their services.",
      "However, many apps that have nothing to do with location still ask for it, and we often grant these permissions without thinking twice. When you give an app access to your location, that data is stored and, in some cases, might even be sold. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this practice is not uncommon.",
      "A recent lawsuit filed by Paxton alleges that the insurance company Allstate collected and sold the location data of 45 million Americans' smartphones.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST & GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2",
      "Illustration of a company tracking customer\u2019s data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Allstate was allegedly collecting and stealing data",
      "In a\u00a0press release, Paxton announced that he had sued Allstate and its subsidiary, Arity, for unlawfully collecting, using and selling data about the location and movements of Texans' cellphones. The data was gathered through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, such as Life360.\u00a0\"Allstate and other insurers then used the covertly obtained data to justify raising Texans\u2019 insurance rates,\" the press release stated.",
      "The insurance provider allegedly collected trillions of miles' worth of location data from more than 45 million Americans nationwide. The data was reportedly used to build the \"world\u2019s largest driving behavior database.\" When customers sought a quote or renewed their coverage, Allstate and other insurance companies allegedly used the database to justify raising car insurance premiums.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Paxton claims the actions violated the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act. The lawsuit alleges customers were not clearly informed their data was being collected and did not consent to the practice.",
      "\"Our investigation revealed that Allstate and Arity paid mobile apps millions of dollars to install Allstate\u2019s tracking software,\" said Paxton.\u00a0\"The personal data of millions of Americans was sold to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent in violation of the law. Texans deserve better and we will hold all these companies accountable.\"",
      "We reached out to Allstate and Arity for comments. A rep for the Allstate Corporation provided CyberGuy with this statement:\u00a0\"Arity helps consumers get the most accurate auto insurance price after they consent in a simple and transparent way that fully complies with all laws and regulations.\"",

      "Car manufacturers have also been accused of selling similar data to insurance companies. Last year, Paxton sued General Motors for allegedly collecting and selling the private driving data of more than 1.5 million Texans to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent. In addition to insurance companies, data brokers are frequent buyers of customer data. Critics say these brokers fail to adequately protect the information, leaving it vulnerable to hackers. Earlier this month,\u00a0hackers claimed to have breached Gravy Analytics, a major location data broker and the parent company of Venntel, which is known for selling smartphone location data to U.S. government agencies.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people. Businesses that prioritize profits over privacy erode trust and put consumers at risk, making it crucial to enforce strict accountability for such practices.",

It caused additional stress for the\u00a0100 million clients of Change Healthcare, whose data was exposed following a breach orchestrated by the BlackCat ransomware group. Not only did the breach expose sensitive health information, but it also caused widespread disruptions in claims processing. Patients and providers across the country faced chaos as the breach impacted their ability to access and pay for healthcare services.",

The consequences are real and can be very painful. Medical identity theft directly affects patients' health and safety. It happens when criminals use stolen personal health information to obtain medical services or medications under another person\u2019s name. It can result in incorrect medical records being created that can include inaccurate diagnoses, allergies or treatments.",
      "And as you may have guessed, it can also result in financial repercussions, such as patients getting fraudulent claims and bills for services they did not receive. Resolving these issues with insurers and healthcare providers takes time and mental strength. And you\u2019re probably not in a hurry to see your breached healthcare provider ever again.

      "2. Remove your personal data from data brokers\u2019 databases: Either by searching for your name on people search sites and requesting removals, one by one, or by using a data removal service. Data removal services automate data removal for you and let you track where exactly your data has been found and whether it was removed, not only on people search sites, which are public data brokers, but also on hidden, private databases where you can\u2019t look yourself up (and these are the worst).",
      "Once your data is removed, data removal services monitor data brokers for your data and remove it again as needed (because it has a tendency to be re-listed after a while). This way, you prevent data broker companies from compiling a full profile on you and selling it to the first bidder, whether that\u2019s a hacker, a marketing agency or an insurance company.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Use a VPN (virtual private network) when browsing: Encrypt your online activities and mask your digital location to add an extra layer of anonymity and protection. A reliable\u00a0VPN can help shield your personal information from potential interceptors and data miners.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

While you can\u2019t prevent breaches from happening, you can take steps to minimize the risks and protect your personal information. Think of it as adding locks to your digital doors: set your social media to private, use a VPN and clean up unused apps.

    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials are expected to leave interest rates steady when they emerge from their first policy meeting of the second Trump administration Tuesday. That would most likely frustrate President Donald Trump, who has sought to pressure the central bank to drive rates lower.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll demand that interest rates drop immediately,\u201d Trump said in wide-ranging remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, via videoconference last week. \u201cAnd likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us all over.\u201d",
      "The remarks extended Trump\u2019s habit of publicizing his views on monetary policy, which U.S. presidents have long avoided to maintain the Fed\u2019s autonomy from politics.",
      "\u201cI know interest rates much better than they do,\u201d he said in follow-up comments after his Davos address. He also renewed his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 and has promised not to remove before Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026.",
      "The Fed is set to announce its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, followed by remarks by Powell around 2:30.",
      "The U.S. economy is in vastly different shape from when Trump left office in January 2021, with the country still gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic and bitter disputes over lockdown measures to combat it.",
      "After a pandemic-era run-up in prices that devastated many consumers\u2019 finances, inflation has largely been tamed at 2.9% as of December, though it has hovered for months above the Fed\u2019s 2% target rate. Unemployment edged down to 4.1% in December from 4.2% the month before after employers added over a quarter-million jobs, helping tamp down worries about a labor market that has remained sturdy even as it cools.",
      "Consumer spending, meanwhile, has held steady despite households\u2019 increasing focus on value. Gross domestic product \u2014 driven significantly by the consumption of goods and services \u2014 was shown in December to have grown by at least 3% for the second consecutive quarter.",
      "Analysts see those metrics, taken together, as signs that the economy is still humming along despite the inflation fight\u2019s difficult \u201clast mile\u201d and that it doesn\u2019t need a fresh boost from the Fed just yet. It has penciled in two rate cuts this year, but Wall Street doesn\u2019t expect the first to arrive Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt the Fed will keep rates as-is this week,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said in a statement. \u201cWhile many households and businesses have felt the pressure of this high rate environment, the economy remains strong. Consumer spending has remained robust, and is credited with maintaining this economic strength.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have issued cuts for three consecutive meetings, whittling their benchmark rate from a 20-year high range of 5.25%-5.5% down to the current 4.25%-4.5%. But economists say the delicate dance of keeping borrowing costs elevated enough to tame price growth without pushing the economy into a recession has grown more complicated. That\u2019s largely due to Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 particularly tariffs, with his first policy move on that front expected Saturday.",
      "Fed policymakers are \u201cin a particularly tricky situation\u201d now, Renter said. \u201cTalk of policies that carry additional inflationary risk carry more weight now that the new administration is in place and beginning work.\u201d",
      "As a result, the path for rate cuts this year is \u201cuncertain,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the financial firm RSM.",
      "\u201cFederal Reserve officials won\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s clear that the central bank\u2019s decisions this year will be shaped by the Trump administration\u2019s policies on trade and immigration,\u201d Brusuelas said in a note Tuesday. \u201cThese policies could lead to higher inflation, or, just as important, raise inflation expectations, which would put the Fed\u2019s long-held 2% inflation target at risk.\u201d"

      "The pilot experienced an \u201cinflight malfunction\u201d but was able to eject from the aircraft, Col. Paul Townsend, commander of the 354th Fighter Wing, told a news conference. The plane crashed during the landing phase of the flight at Eielson Air Force Base, he said.",

    "story": [
      "HONOLULU \u2014 When Hawaii Gov. Josh Green announced a $4 billion settlement about a year after\u00a0the deadliest U.S. wildfire\u00a0in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023, he touted the speed of the deal to \u201cavoid protracted and painful lawsuits.\u201d",
      "Five months later, however, an unusual trial starting Wednesday will delve into difficult questions about survivors\u2019 losses as a judge decides how to divide\u00a0the settlement. Some victims will take the witness stand, while others have submitted pre-recorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the\u00a0recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "The trial won\u2019t determine fault. Defendants blamed for the blaze including the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric and large landowners have already agreed to the settlement amount.",
      "At issue is how much money various groups of plaintiffs might receive, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their family members, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who simply had to cancel trips to Maui following the inferno.",
      "Lawyers for the two groups failed to come to an agreement, leaving it up to Judge Peter Cahill to determine how the $4 billion should be shared.",
      "\u201cA class action is everybody suffering the same loss,\u201d said Damon Valverde, whose Lahaina sunglasses company burned. \u201cAnd I suffered quite a bit more than others, and others suffered quite a bit more than me.\u201d",
      "Valverde isn\u2019t expected to testify; the focus should be on victims who lost family members, he said.",
      "Those include Kevin Baclig, whose wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the\u00a0102 people known to have died.",
      "Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them \u2014 from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter. \u201cI clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,\u201d he said.",
      "A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife\u2019s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.",
      "\u201cThe loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.\u201d",
      "The class action includes some people who lost homes and businesses, but also tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled. Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go toward that group, said Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing victims \u2014 like Baclig \u2014 who have filed their own lawsuits, known as the \u201cindividual plaintiffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,\u201d Lowenthal said.",
      "Attorneys representing the class didn\u2019t respond to messages from The Associated Press. In their trial brief, they challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over has already done so. Many people have held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire\u2019s disruption to life, \u201cdistrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first.\u201d",
      "Further complicating the matter are questions\u00a0before the state Supreme Court, which is considering whether insurers can separately sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 billion-plus they have paid out as a result of the fire, or whether their share must come from the $4 billion settlement.",
      "If the court says insurers can sue separately, that will likely torpedo the entire deal. Preventing insurers from going after the defendants is a key settlement term, and allowing them to do so would drain the money available for fire victims and lead to prolonged litigation, lawyers for the individual plaintiffs say."

      "Hosted on Jan. 19 by a Cocoa Beach High School student at the home of Roosevelt Elementary School Principal Elizabeth Hill-Brodigan, the party was attended by a crowd of more than 100 that included underage drinkers and juveniles, Cocoa Beach police said.",
      "Hill-Brodigan and teacher Karly Anderson failed to give proper care to juveniles during the festivities, police alleged.",
      "Hill-Brodigan is charged with child neglect, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and hosting a party with alcohol that was accessible to minors, called an \"open house party\" under Florida law. Anderson is charged with child neglect and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.",
      "Both were booked into the Brevard County Jail on Friday and released Saturday, with $3,500 bond attached to Hill-Brodigan's case and $3,000 to Anderson's, according to jail records.",
      "On Tuesday, each pleaded not guilty via court filings, which also requested jury trials for each to move forward without delay.",
      "An attorney for Hill-Brodigan declined to comment Tuesday. Anderson's legal counsel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Brevard Public Schools said they have been placed on administrative leave.",
      "\"We are extremely troubled by these accusations and are fully cooperating with the Cocoa Beach Police Department,\" the district said in a statement. \"Our commitment to student safety remains our top priority.\"",
      "Superintendent Mark Rendell said in a letter to the district's parents and community that the allegations, if true, represent \"a complete failure in leadership and violation of our trust.\"",
      "Investigators said the party featured a teenage boy pointing a 9 mm handgun at a student recording him, a vomiting partygoer so drunk that paramedics were called, the use of marijuana, the eruption of fights and violence \u2014 with one incident reported to be on video \u2014 and a teenage girl arrested nearby for driving with a blood alcohol level well above the legal limit of 0.02 for those under 21.",
      "The allegations were in a pair of affidavits filed in support of the two educators' arrests.",
      "The girl's blood alcohol level was 0.118, police said in the documents, which also say she and her passenger were wearing clothing emblazoned with the night's theme: \"white lie.\"",

      "They said Hill-Brodigan had some students come early to help with \"preparations,\" as she is allegedly to have done before, according to the affidavits.",
      "\"Elizabeth made no attempt to stop the party at any point and advised that she seemed okay with what was happening,\" detectives said some of the attendees told them later, according to the documents.",
      "Anderson told police on the phone the next day that she does not participate in what she described as \"ragers,\" according to the affidavits.",
      "Hill-Brodigan's home is listed in jail records as being on Country Club Road, an intracoastal street that runs through the upscale Cocoa Isles Country Club and River Sunset neighborhoods, where residences have been listed for sale at nearly $2 million. Anderson lives at an address on the same road, according to jail records.",
      "The high school is less than a half-mile away.",
      "It's not clear what might have motivated the educators to help teenagers throw parties. One affidavit says Anderson told officers her own children were not there that night.",
      "At the Jan. 19 event, police said, alcoholic coolers were seen, and the high school host, a juvenile girl, was featured in social media photos from the event holding a can of an alcoholic beverage.",
      "The police affidavits described Anderson as inebriated. At one point, as Anderson protested the ill partygoer's medical treatment by paramedics, police told her to \"go away,\" the court documents say. She told officers that night that Hill-Brodigan was not drunk because she had so far had only one beverage, according to the affidavits.",
      "Officers were called to the home multiple times that Sunday night \u2014 starting at 8:40 p.m. and extending into the 11 o'clock hour \u2014 based on neighbors' disturbance reports, including claims that young attendees were trampling over their property, police said in the affidavits.",
      "The first time, police said, Hill-Brodigan indicated the festivities would be shut down. But they partied on, and officers were called to respond anew, according to the court documents.",
      "It finally ended with a prank, the affidavits say.",
      "Someone who sounded like a juvenile boy reported shots fired at a nearby skate park shortly before 11:30 p.m., according to the affidavits. He added that a satanic ritual was also taking place nearby and that, as part of it, someone was being held at gunpoint, the affidavits say.",
      "Police responded, leaving the festivities to carry on unabated, the documents say.",

    "summary": "High-voltage power lines saw a temporary surge in electrical current in the area where the deadly Eaton Fire is believed to have started, Southern California Edison said.",
    "story": [
      "High-voltage power lines saw a temporary surge in electrical current in the area where the deadly Eaton Fire is believed to have started following a \"fault\" on a line elsewhere in the region's transmission network, Southern California Edison said Monday.",
      "While the fault, or disturbance, occurred several miles away on a power line that does not traverse Eaton Canyon, it was detected at 6:11 p.m. on Jan. 7, the utility said in a filing with state public utilities regulators. That was only minutes before authorities received initial reports of a wind-fueled fire originating in the canyon at 6:18 p.m.",
      "\"The fault on this geographically distant line caused a momentary and expected increase in current on SCE's transmission system, including on the four energized lines\" in Eaton Canyon, the utility said, adding, \"The current increase remained within the design limits and operating criteria for these circuits and, as intended, did not trigger system protection on these lines.\"",
      "The cause of the Eaton Fire, which raced down the canyon and ravaged the foothill communities of Altadena and Pasadena, remains under investigation. Southern California Edison is at the center of a wave of negligence and wrongful death lawsuits after videos taken by residents showed the flames illuminating the base of one of the utility's electrical towers clustered on a hillside, just as hurricane-force Santa Ana winds tore through the region.",
      "While the utility said it did de-energize power distribution lines that serve homes in the area about two hours before the Eaton Fire started, the transmission lines in Eaton Canyon were not shut off because those towers are stronger and can operate at heavier winds.",
      "New video also emerged over the weekend taken from a nearby gas station security camera around the time of the fire and obtained by Edelson PC, a law firm suing Southern California Edison. The video purports to show electrical arcs and sparking from a transmission tower in Eaton Canyon, and the orange glow of flames appearing about 10 minutes later.",
      "In its filing Monday, the utility told state regulators it is reviewing the video to assess any connection.",
      "\"While our preliminary investigation uncovered no obvious damage to SCE's facilities, based in part upon this new video and statements made by plaintiffs' counsel claiming damage, we continue to assess the condition of our equipment in Eaton Canyon,\" the utility added.",
      "Utility officials also said they are preserving materials at the scene of the towers as requested by the various lawsuits, and some plaintiffs \"have requested that the transmission lines attached to the transmission towers be lowered for further visual inspection and remain de-energized until that can be accomplished.\"",
      "\"This is a complex request due to the challenging terrain and lack of accessibility in this area,\" the utility said, adding that it is still working to return power to homes in Altadena.",
      "A judge ordered materials to be preserved after Altadena resident Evangeline Iglesias, a plaintiff in a lawsuit, accused the utility of planning to discard damaged distribution equipment that may hold clues to the fire's origin.",
      "\"It's only by sheer luck this footage exists,\" Jay Edelson, founder of Edelson PC, which is representing Iglesias, said in a statement about the gas station security video.\u00a0He added that there will be evidence at trial that \"we believe will prove why this arcing occurred.\"",
      "The utility has said that it will review the complaints and that \u201cour hearts remain with our communities during the devastating fires in Southern California, and we remain committed to supporting them through this difficult time.\u201d Utility spokesman David Eisenhauer said Tuesday that the gas station video will require \u201cvery careful analysis\u201d and that the company's investigation will continue with transparency.",
      "At least 29 people have died in the multiple wildfires that erupted this month in the Los Angeles area, destroying thousands of homes and causing billions of dollars in damage. The Eaton Fire, which burned through more than 14,000 acres, was 99% contained as of Tuesday, fire officials said."

      "The order states that more children will come to regret receiving such care and that they are \u201coften trapped with lifelong medical complications\u201d and sterilization.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called \u2018transition\u2019 of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\u201d the order states.",
      "Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, promised to fight the executive order in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThis broadside condemns transgender youth to extreme and unnecessary pain and suffering, and their parents to agonized futility in caring for their child \u2014 all while denying them access to the same medically recommended health care that is readily available to their cisgender peers,\u201d said Lambda Legal attorney Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, alluding to the fact that the order does not appear to bar puberty blockers, hormone therapy or similar surgeries for minors who are not transgender.",
      "Transition-related care for minors has dominated headlines in recent years, with 26 states passing laws restricting such care. However, recent research has shown that a small number of minors actually access this type of care. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics in January found that less than 0.1% of adolescents with private insurance in the U.S. are transgender or gender-diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones.",
      "Trans minors are treated on a case-by-case basis and are legally required to receive their parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s consent to receive any medical intervention. Before a child starts puberty, medical standards developed by WPATH and other medical organizations recommend that a child receive therapy and social transition, or changing their hairstyle, clothing, name and pronouns.",
      "Once a child begins puberty, they may start puberty blockers if they have persistent gender dysphoria, which is the medical term for the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex. Teenagers might start hormone therapy, and, in rare cases, some older teens may receive a double mastectomy, where both breasts are removed.",
      "Most major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "One section of Trump\u2019s executive order, \u201cEnding Reliance on Junk Science,\u201d specifically takes aim at WPATH, arguing that it \u201clacks scientific integrity,\u201d and directs the secretary of HHS to \u201cpublish a review of the existing literature on best practices for promoting the health of children who assert gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Secretary of HHS, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, shall use all available methods to increase the quality of data to guide practices for improving the health of minors with gender dysphoria, rapid-onset gender dysphoria, or other identity-based confusion, or who otherwise seek chemical or surgical mutilation,\u201d the order states.",
      "WPATH did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Half a dozen studies in recent years have found that transition-related care improves minors\u2019 mental health and reduces suicide rates. However, in December, the United Kingdom indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria. The ban followed an independent study commissioned by England\u2019s National Health Service that found that medical evidence for transition-related care for minors was \u201cremarkably weak.\u201d The study has faced criticism from some researchers and activists."

      "The Trump administration\u2019s attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion programs threaten to derail efforts to fix racial disparities associated with pulse oximeters \u2014 just as the federal government was finally making headway on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe are very concerned,\u201d said Dr. Michael Lipnick, an anesthesiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, whose work is dedicated to resolving how pulse oximeters perform on a variety of skin tones. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to figure out where the money is going to come from next.\u201d",
      "Eighty percent of Lipnick\u2019s research funding has typically come from federal health agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).",
      "The future of that money is now in question. Just hours after he was sworn in for a second term last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning DEI initiatives. While that order primarily focused on ways in which employees are hired, there is concern about spillover into pulse oximeter studies intended to expand the number of participants with darker skin tones.",
      "That is, how can researchers seek out people of color to fill gaps in research while adhering to new directives to stop focusing on race?",
      "Recent directives to halt scientific communications from federal health agencies have frustrated federal health scientists seeking clarity on whether they\u2019d be able to continue research. A request for comment from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees all federal health agencies, was not immediately answered.",
      "\u201cI have spent probably 25 hours in the last week talking with my colleagues as we try to understand what these poorly written, obviously immoral and probably unlawful orders will actually mean,\u201d said Dr. Theodore Iwashyna, a critical care physician and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "Iwashyna co-authored an influential 2020 study showing how pulse oximeters don\u2019t work as intended in Black patients.",
      "He described the anti-DEI initiatives as \u201can attack on the scientists who are most likely to do work to ensure pulse oximeters work better for everyone.\u201d",
      "Pulse oximeters are commonly used during routine checkups, seeking out oxygen-rich blood by shining a light through the fingertip. That light, however, also absorbs skin pigment. The more pigment a person has, the healthier they seem to be, often leading to faulty pulse oximeter readings in people with darker skin.",
      "While the racial disparities of pulse oximeters have been known for decades, in-depth research into the disparities reignited during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The FDA appears to be focused on finalizing guidelines for pulse oximeter manufacturers to address the issue. Earlier this month, the FDA issued\u00a0draft guidance\u00a0for manufacturers to drastically expand the skin tone varieties when testing their devices and demonstrate how they work equally for all skin pigments.",
      "Not all research on racial disparities of pulse oximeters is threatened. Dr. Andrew Goodwin at the Medical University of South Carolina is leading a massive effort to analyze possible racial differences in pulse oximetry readings in hospitalized patients.",
      "Goodwin\u2019s work is expected to continue because it\u2019s secured private funding from one of the biggest pulse oximeter manufacturers, Masimo.",
      "His research team has recruited nearly 200 patients so far. \u201cWe have a really robust distribution across skin pigment thus far in our preliminary data set,\u201d Goodwin said. Results aren\u2019t expected for several more years.",
      "The future of Lipnick\u2019s research, however, is unclear, even as he\u2019s moved his family from San Francisco to Kampala, Uganda, to set up a pulse oximetry lab to explore how pulse oximeters work on darker skin tones.",
      "His team has just begun applying for new federal funding.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re broke,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody at the intersection of health equity is like, \u2018What is about to happen?\u2019\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:15:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Tuberculosis cases linked to an ongoing outbreak in the Kansas City area continue to climb. The outbreak, which began a year ago, killed two people in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of tuberculosis cases linked to an outbreak in the Kansas City area continues to swell, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.",
      "The outbreak, which began a year ago, killed two people in 2024, Jill Bronaugh, the health department's communications director, said in an update Tuesday. As of Friday, at least 67 patients were being treated for active tuberculosis in Kansas.",
      "All but seven of those cases were in Wyandotte County, where Kansas City is, while the others were in neighboring Johnson County. Across the two counties, the health department has also confirmed 79 inactive tuberculosis infections, meaning the host isn\u2019t contagious and doesn\u2019t have symptoms. If left untreated, around 5% to 10% of inactive cases develop into active disease.",
      "Last year, the health department reported over 70 active and more than 200 inactive tuberculosis cases, though Bronaugh said the \u201ccase counts are still provisional, as they will be reviewed and confirmed officially by the CDC near the end of March.\u201d",
      "Dr. Dana Hawkinson, director of infection prevention and control for the University of Kansas Health System, said he usually sees \"a handful of cases of active tuberculosis,\" every year, but this outbreak has been differentiated by \"the scope and the numbers.\"",
      "Hawkinson added that the majority of tuberculosis patients he has seen during the outbreak have not been significantly ill, though some have developed serious symptoms.",
      "In its update, Kansas' health department described the tuberculosis outbreak as \u201cthe largest documented outbreak in U.S. history\u201d since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began monitoring and reporting cases in the 1950s.",
      "But the CDC rebutted that characterization, pointing to a tuberculosis outbreak in Georgia homeless shelters from 2015 to 2017, in which more than 170\u00a0cases of active tuberculosis and over 400 inactive cases were detected. The agency also cited a national outbreak in 2021 linked to a bone graft product that affected 113 patients after surgery.",
      "Tuberculosis is an airborne bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. Those sickened can have chest pain, feel weak and cough up blood or mucus from the respiratory tract, according to the CDC.",
      "For patients with tuberculosis \u2014 active or inactive \u2014 treatment involves antibiotics and can take months. If left untreated, the disease can be fatal. Tuberculosis was responsible for 25% of all deaths in Europe from the 1600s to the 1800s, according to the CDC.",
      "Hawkinson said treatment for a serious tuberculosis case usually lasts about six months.",
      "\u201cWe initially start with four drugs for about two months, and then the rest of the time we are able to transition to a two-drug regimen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut typically, once you start on therapy, after about 10 days or two weeks, you are able to become non-infectious and able to be going out into the community.\u201d",
      "A vaccine for tuberculosis \u2014\u00a0first developed in 1921 \u2014\u00a0is not generally used in the U.S. but is administered to infants and children in countries where the disease is more common.",
      "The outbreak in Kansas \"is still ongoing, which means that there could be more cases,\" Bronaugh said in the health department update.",
      "Hawkinson said the risk of contracting tuberculosis in Kansas is low overall and that the state has been seeing fewer infections over the last couple of months. He emphasized the importance of public health funding for investigations into cases to help stop the disease's spread.",
      "In the U.S. overall, tuberculosis cases rose each year from 2020 to 2023 \u2014 the latest data available \u2014\u00a0according to the CDC. That upward trend ended nearly three decades of decline."

It is reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris wasn\u2019t performing well in softball interviews as her sugar high faded in September and early October.",
      "But if she wanted to expand her support \u2014 and she needed to \u2014 she would have to expose herself to tough questioning. That was particularly important with men\u2014specifically young men\u2014who were not buying what she was selling.",
      "The obvious answer: Joe Rogan. A late-1990s sitcom star turned bro-with-a-brain podcaster, Rogan boasted a subscriber base that amounted to a total eclipse of the genre\u2019s universe, with nearly 15 million signed up just on Spotify. His 2018 interview with Elon Musk, during which the Tesla and SpaceX founder smoked pot and sipped whiskey, garnered tens of millions of views on YouTube and crashed the next-generation car company\u2019s stock.",
      "The vast majority of Rogan\u2019s guests and listeners were white men, presenting Harris with a potentially golden opportunity to prove her mettle by walking into the lion\u2019s den.",
      "On October\u00a011, Harris deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the aide in charge of digital strategy, made the first Zoom call to start negotiating with Rogan\u2019s reps. He did not know what to expect.\u00a0These might be juiced-up, UFC-looking supplement people, he thought. He was surprised\u2014perhaps a tad disappointed\u2014to find out that Rogan\u2019s associates were more like Hollywood agents. In that vein, they outlined the podcaster\u2019s conditions for an interview: no staff in the studio, no topic restrictions, and Harris would have to sign a waiver.",
      "There was one more item in the small print: Harris would have to come to Austin, Texas. Rogan\u2019s reps said that might be negotiable, but he had only once done an interview with an out-of-studio guest. That was leaker Edward Snowden, who was wanted in the United States at the time.",
      "Along with fellow Harris campaign advisers Stephanie Cutter and Brian Fallon, Flaherty offered up that Harris would be happy to talk about social media censorship, weed, and other issues they thought would be of most interest to his listeners. From their perspective, it was a suggestion of possible topics, not an exhaustive or exclusive list. That\u2019s not what Rogan wanted to talk about. \u201cJoe just wants to talk about the economy, the border, and abortion,\u201d one of his reps said, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.",
      "After two Zoom sessions, Flaherty called the Rogan intermediaries with an offer. Could Rogan join Harris in Michigan? he asked, proposing a date later in the week. No-go, the Rogan team said after reaching the host on a weeklong hunting trip. Austin or nothing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cWe\u2019re only a few weeks out from the election.\u201d Harris had less than zero reason to be in Texas. It was not a swing state. Her campaign was flush with cash\u2014so it made no sense to take her off the trail to raise money. She was in battleground-or-bust mode. Plus, a detour to Texas might smell like desperation to the press and a waste of money to donors.",
      "Harris campaign chief Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon broke the impasse. Harris would be in Atlanta\u00a0on October\u00a024\u00a0with Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen. O\u2019Malley Dillon said the campaign could fly her to Houston for a rally\u2014under the cover of visiting a state with one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws\u2014to put her in proximity to Austin.\u00a0She dispatched an advance team to the Texas state capital to do a walk-through of Rogan\u2019s studio and get ready for a Harris arrival. She authorized her negotiating team to give Rogan what he demanded\u2014an in-studio interview in Austin\u2014on October\u00a025.",
      "For all of former President Donald Trump\u2019s work to reach apolitical voters through podcasts, YouTube, and other outlets, Harris positioned herself to score a coup by grabbing the biggest megaphone of them all. If she did, she would be exploiting a rift between Rogan and Trump.",
      "Rogan had called Trump a \u201cman baby\u201d and a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d in 2022, vowing not to interview the former president. At the time, the beef was just one more sign of the social stigma attached to Trump after the January\u00a06 assault on the Capitol, said one longtime Trump adviser. But when Rogan appeared to endorse independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in August, Trump fired back on the Truth Social media platform: \u201cIt will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024.,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "At the same time, Rogan was hardly Mr.\u00a0Popular inside Harris\u2019s camp. Her brother in law, Tony West, longtime adviser Minyon Moore and others argued against putting Harris on the podcast, especially after her first venture into politically tough terrain\u2014an interview with Fox\u2019s Bret Baier in the middle of the Rogan negotiations\u2014bombed.",
      "There was no telling what Rogan might ask her or how he would treat her. Plus, his \u201cantiwoke\u201d crusade had made him a pariah on the hard left. They were overruled by O\u2019Malley Dillon\u2019s crew, but not because the concerns were considered invalid. \u201cEven for those of us who were in favor of it, it was a close call,\u201d said one of the Harris advisers involved in the back-and-forth.",
      "The Harris high command was not built to lob Hail Mary passes. Its leaders, starting with O\u2019Malley Dillon, cut their teeth on campaigns that ridiculed fellow Democrats for \u201cbed-wetting\u201d whether crises were imagined or real. Seeking an interview on a popular podcast hardly qualified as a desperation throw downfield. But it was a relatively risky move for a campaign leadership that had kept its candidate hermetically sealed in the manufacturer\u2019s box, like she would retain more value without exposure to air and sunlight.",
      "On October\u00a010, the day before Flaherty first spoke with Rogan\u2019s team, the Harris campaign\u2019s weekly internal analytics assessment of the race\u2014a 129-page document\u2014had projected Harris winning exactly 270 electoral votes. She was on track to take the Blue Wall and Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District\u2014but lose the rest of the swing states\u2014at least according to her own analysts.",
      "Beneath the top-line numbers, though, the analytics showed why it was so important for Harris to reach the type of voters who listened to Rogan. In battleground states, Trump led Harris by 10.6 percentage points among men and trailed her by 9.3 percentage points among women, according to her team\u2019s figures. In both gender splits, Trump did about 2 points better against Harris in the battlegrounds\u2014the area of greatest concentration for the campaigns\u2014than in national polling. He led her among young men, was tied with Hispanic men, and trailed her among Black men by a smaller margin than Biden beat him by in 2020.",
      "For many Democratic operatives outside the campaign, the\u00a0October\u00a022\u00a0announcement that Harris would hold a Houston rally felt like a palm-to-face moment. She was going to lose Texas, by a lot, and a visit would not force Trump to spend his limited campaign money there.",
      "Her aides scheduled the rally for a\u00a0Friday night\u00a0in the fall \u2014 October\u00a025 \u2014 in Texas! It was as if no one on her team knew that the night reserved for high school football was more sacred than Easter in the state. Campaign adviser David Plouffe responded to the criticism publicly, explaining that Harris wanted to shine a spotlight on a place where she believed Trump\u2019s anti-abortion policies had done the most damage to women\u2019s health.",
      "Only a few people knew the real reason: the whole Houston rally was built to put her in proximity to Rogan. The ongoing negotiations on that were touch-and-go.",
      "Flaherty had called his Rogan contacts\u00a0on October\u00a018, before the rally was set.",
      "\u201cWe could do Friday, the 25th,\u201d Flaherty said.",
      "\u201cWish we had known about this sooner, because he has the 25th blocked out as a personal day,\u201d one of Rogan\u2019s reps said.",
      "\u201cWhat about\u00a0Saturday morning?\u201d Flaherty countered.",
      "\u201cOnly if it\u2019s before\u00a08:30 a.m.,\u201d came the tough reply.",
      "The tone is different, Flaherty thought.\u00a0The vice president of the United States is offering to come to your f\u2014ing show, and you keep putting up more hoops. Harris\u2019s team still wanted to make it work, but a new wariness set in.",
      "On October 22, the same day the Harris camp announced the rally, the Associated Press reported that Trump would be Rogan\u2019s guest on Friday \u2014 the \u201cpersonal day\u201d Rogan had originally reserved.",
      "Mutual friends Elon Musk and Dana White had convinced Trump and Rogan to bury their dispute, according to a Trump aide. There would be no Harris interview.",
      "In this wild hand of Texas Hold \u2019Em, Harris aides thought they had one more ace to play. Beyonc\u00e9 was in Houston and willing to perform at the rally. \u201cThe plan changed like 20 times that day, and they landed on her singing \u2018Freedom\u2019\u00a0a cappella\u00a0before Harris walked on stage,\u201d said one person familiar with the back-and-forth between the campaign and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s team.",
      "As consolation prizes go, a Beyonc\u00e9 performance ranked pretty high. She was a bigger star than Rogan \u2014 a bona fide global diva \u2014 and \u201cFreedom\u201d was the campaign\u2019s theme song. But Beyonc\u00e9 would not give Harris the potential benefits of a Rogan interview: demonstration of her willingness to go outside her comfort zone and connection to a new audience.",
      "Worse for Harris, Beyonc\u00e9 didn't perform. She would speak. But she would not sing.",
      "No Rogan. No \u201cFreedom.\u201d The campaign kept its poker face, but it had played out a losing hand. Trump spent three hours with Rogan in an interview that instantly went viral. The contrast amounted to a \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d said one Harris aide, \u201cthat I will never forget.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t quite over. Rogan would later blame the missed connection on Harris and accuse her of refusing to talk about marijuana, even though her platform included legalization.",
      "Harris aides made a final stab, offering to let Rogan talk with the vice president in Washington, D.C., the day after a closing-argument speech at the foot of the White House. Rogan\u2019s team balked, citing the Austin-only condition.",
      "Flaherty had seen enough. \u201cYou get one trip to Texas within three weeks of the election,\u201d he told Rogan\u2019s associates. \u201cYou don\u2019t get two.\u201d",

      "Fine and Patronis will be heavy favorites against the Democratic nominees in the special general elections after both districts went Republican by 30-plus points last year.",
      "But House Republicans will still have the April 1 special elections circled on their calendars, as adding members would give them a bit more breathing room in a tightly divided chamber.",
      "After Waltz and Gaetz resigned, the GOP has a 218-215 edge in the House \u2014 meaning only two defections could sink a bill with every member voting."

      "Here\u2019s what to know today.",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to withhold federal funding sets up a constitutional showdown",
      "President Donald Trump's mission to cut government spending came into sharper view this week with a buyout offer for roughly 2 million federal workers and an order to freeze federal aid.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s offer to all full-time federal employees, with some exceptions, offers benefits and pay through the end of September. A senior administration official said they expect 5%-10% of the workforce to quit, which, they estimate, could lead to around $100 billion in savings. Read more about the buyout offer.",
      "Meanwhile, an abrupt halt on federal grants and loans announced Monday night created widespread confusion across the government. A memo sent yesterday afternoon by the Office of Management and Budget clarified that Medicaid, food stamps, small business assistance, Head Start, rental assistance and federal Pell Grants for college students would be excluded from the pause and exempt from review.",
      "This is Morning Rundown, a weekday newsletter to start your day. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.",
      "Minutes before the freeze was set to take effect, a federal district judge granted an administrative stay in a case challenging the Trump administration\u2019s order. The judge\u2019s decision pauses the plan for a week and sets up a hearing for further arguments on Monday.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to freeze funding is fueling a long-brewing legal battle over the core constitutional principle that says Congress gets to decide how to spend taxpayer money. Litigation could quickly make its way up at the Supreme Court.",
      "Challengers are likely to cite the Impoundment Control Act, a law passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. The Trump administration is already countering that argument. In the OMB\u2019s memo, the Trump administration said it aims to evaluate the programs that receive federal funding to ensure they are aligned with Trump\u2019s agenda, despite that funding having been approved by Congress and signed into law, making it exempt from the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "\u201cIt seems clear to me that the Trump administration is aching to get this issue to the Supreme Court,\u201d said Sam Bagenstos, who served as OMB general counsel under former President Joe Biden. \u201cThe Trump administration clearly thinks they have a favorable court.\u201d",

      "Editor\u2019s note: The following is excerpted from the forthcoming book \u201cFIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House\u201d (copyright\u00a0\u00a9 2025),\u00a0by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, which is due to be published April 1 by William Morrow. It is reprinted courtesy of HarperCollins Publishers.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris wasn\u2019t performing well in softball interviews as her sugar high faded in September and early October.",
      "But if she wanted to expand her support \u2014 and she needed to \u2014 she would have to expose herself to tough questioning. That was particularly important with men\u2014specifically young men\u2014who were not buying what she was selling.",
      "The obvious answer: Joe Rogan. A late-1990s sitcom star turned bro-with-a-brain podcaster, Rogan boasted a subscriber base that amounted to a total eclipse of the genre\u2019s universe, with nearly 15 million signed up just on Spotify. His 2018 interview with Elon Musk, during which the Tesla and SpaceX founder smoked pot and sipped whiskey, garnered tens of millions of views on YouTube and crashed the next-generation car company\u2019s stock.",
      "The vast majority of Rogan\u2019s guests and listeners were white men, presenting Harris with a potentially golden opportunity to prove her mettle by walking into the lion\u2019s den.",
      "On October\u00a011, Harris deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty, the aide in charge of digital strategy, made the first Zoom call to start negotiating with Rogan\u2019s reps. He did not know what to expect.\u00a0These might be juiced-up, UFC-looking supplement people, he thought. He was surprised\u2014perhaps a tad disappointed\u2014to find out that Rogan\u2019s associates were more like Hollywood agents. In that vein, they outlined the podcaster\u2019s conditions for an interview: no staff in the studio, no topic restrictions, and Harris would have to sign a waiver.",
      "There was one more item in the small print: Harris would have to come to Austin, Texas. Rogan\u2019s reps said that might be negotiable, but he had only once done an interview with an out-of-studio guest. That was leaker Edward Snowden, who was wanted in the United States at the time.",
      "Along with fellow Harris campaign advisers Stephanie Cutter and Brian Fallon, Flaherty offered up that Harris would be happy to talk about social media censorship, weed, and other issues they thought would be of most interest to his listeners. From their perspective, it was a suggestion of possible topics, not an exhaustive or exclusive list. That\u2019s not what Rogan wanted to talk about. \u201cJoe just wants to talk about the economy, the border, and abortion,\u201d one of his reps said, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.",
      "After two Zoom sessions, Flaherty called the Rogan intermediaries with an offer. Could Rogan join Harris in Michigan? he asked, proposing a date later in the week. No-go, the Rogan team said after reaching the host on a weeklong hunting trip. Austin or nothing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Flaherty said. \u201cWe\u2019re only a few weeks out from the election.\u201d Harris had less than zero reason to be in Texas. It was not a swing state. Her campaign was flush with cash\u2014so it made no sense to take her off the trail to raise money. She was in battleground-or-bust mode. Plus, a detour to Texas might smell like desperation to the press and a waste of money to donors.",
      "Harris campaign chief Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon broke the impasse. Harris would be in Atlanta\u00a0on October\u00a024\u00a0with Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen. O\u2019Malley Dillon said the campaign could fly her to Houston for a rally\u2014under the cover of visiting a state with one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion laws\u2014to put her in proximity to Austin.\u00a0She dispatched an advance team to the Texas state capital to do a walk-through of Rogan\u2019s studio and get ready for a Harris arrival. She authorized her negotiating team to give Rogan what he demanded\u2014an in-studio interview in Austin\u2014on October\u00a025.",
      "For all of former President Donald Trump\u2019s work to reach apolitical voters through podcasts, YouTube, and other outlets, Harris positioned herself to score a coup by grabbing the biggest megaphone of them all. If she did, she would be exploiting a rift between Rogan and Trump.",
      "Rogan had called Trump a \u201cman baby\u201d and a \u201cthreat to democracy\u201d in 2022, vowing not to interview the former president. At the time, the beef was just one more sign of the social stigma attached to Trump after the January\u00a06 assault on the Capitol, said one longtime Trump adviser. But when Rogan appeared to endorse independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in August, Trump fired back on the Truth Social media platform: \u201cIt will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024.,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "At the same time, Rogan was hardly Mr.\u00a0Popular inside Harris\u2019s camp. Her brother in law, Tony West, longtime adviser Minyon Moore and others argued against putting Harris on the podcast, especially after her first venture into politically tough terrain\u2014an interview with Fox\u2019s Bret Baier in the middle of the Rogan negotiations\u2014bombed.",
      "There was no telling what Rogan might ask her or how he would treat her. Plus, his \u201cantiwoke\u201d crusade had made him a pariah on the hard left. They were overruled by O\u2019Malley Dillon\u2019s crew, but not because the concerns were considered invalid. \u201cEven for those of us who were in favor of it, it was a close call,\u201d said one of the Harris advisers involved in the back-and-forth.",
      "The Harris high command was not built to lob Hail Mary passes. Its leaders, starting with O\u2019Malley Dillon, cut their teeth on campaigns that ridiculed fellow Democrats for \u201cbed-wetting\u201d whether crises were imagined or real. Seeking an interview on a popular podcast hardly qualified as a desperation throw downfield. But it was a relatively risky move for a campaign leadership that had kept its candidate hermetically sealed in the manufacturer\u2019s box, like she would retain more value without exposure to air and sunlight.",
      "On October\u00a010, the day before Flaherty first spoke with Rogan\u2019s team, the Harris campaign\u2019s weekly internal analytics assessment of the race\u2014a 129-page document\u2014had projected Harris winning exactly 270 electoral votes. She was on track to take the Blue Wall and Nebraska\u2019s 2nd District\u2014but lose the rest of the swing states\u2014at least according to her own analysts.",
      "Beneath the top-line numbers, though, the analytics showed why it was so important for Harris to reach the type of voters who listened to Rogan. In battleground states, Trump led Harris by 10.6 percentage points among men and trailed her by 9.3 percentage points among women, according to her team\u2019s figures. In both gender splits, Trump did about 2 points better against Harris in the battlegrounds\u2014the area of greatest concentration for the campaigns\u2014than in national polling. He led her among young men, was tied with Hispanic men, and trailed her among Black men by a smaller margin than Biden beat him by in 2020.",
      "For many Democratic operatives outside the campaign, the\u00a0October\u00a022\u00a0announcement that Harris would hold a Houston rally felt like a palm-to-face moment. She was going to lose Texas, by a lot, and a visit would not force Trump to spend his limited campaign money there.",
      "Her aides scheduled the rally for a\u00a0Friday night\u00a0in the fall \u2014 October\u00a025 \u2014 in Texas! It was as if no one on her team knew that the night reserved for high school football was more sacred than Easter in the state. Campaign adviser David Plouffe responded to the criticism publicly, explaining that Harris wanted to shine a spotlight on a place where she believed Trump\u2019s anti-abortion policies had done the most damage to women\u2019s health.",
      "Only a few people knew the real reason: the whole Houston rally was built to put her in proximity to Rogan. The ongoing negotiations on that were touch-and-go.",
      "Flaherty had called his Rogan contacts\u00a0on October\u00a018, before the rally was set.",
      "\u201cWe could do Friday, the 25th,\u201d Flaherty said.",
      "\u201cWish we had known about this sooner, because he has the 25th blocked out as a personal day,\u201d one of Rogan\u2019s reps said.",
      "\u201cWhat about\u00a0Saturday morning?\u201d Flaherty countered.",
      "\u201cOnly if it\u2019s before\u00a08:30 a.m.,\u201d came the tough reply.",
      "The tone is different, Flaherty thought.\u00a0The vice president of the United States is offering to come to your f\u2014ing show, and you keep putting up more hoops. Harris\u2019s team still wanted to make it work, but a new wariness set in.",
      "On October 22, the same day the Harris camp announced the rally, the Associated Press reported that Trump would be Rogan\u2019s guest on Friday \u2014 the \u201cpersonal day\u201d Rogan had originally reserved.",
      "Mutual friends Elon Musk and Dana White had convinced Trump and Rogan to bury their dispute, according to a Trump aide. There would be no Harris interview.",
      "In this wild hand of Texas Hold \u2019Em, Harris aides thought they had one more ace to play. Beyonc\u00e9 was in Houston and willing to perform at the rally. \u201cThe plan changed like 20 times that day, and they landed on her singing \u2018Freedom\u2019\u00a0a cappella\u00a0before Harris walked on stage,\u201d said one person familiar with the back-and-forth between the campaign and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s team.",
      "As consolation prizes go, a Beyonc\u00e9 performance ranked pretty high. She was a bigger star than Rogan \u2014 a bona fide global diva \u2014 and \u201cFreedom\u201d was the campaign\u2019s theme song. But Beyonc\u00e9 would not give Harris the potential benefits of a Rogan interview: demonstration of her willingness to go outside her comfort zone and connection to a new audience.",
      "Worse for Harris, Beyonc\u00e9 didn't perform. She would speak. But she would not sing.",
      "No Rogan. No \u201cFreedom.\u201d The campaign kept its poker face, but it had played out a losing hand. Trump spent three hours with Rogan in an interview that instantly went viral. The contrast amounted to a \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d said one Harris aide, \u201cthat I will never forget.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t quite over. Rogan would later blame the missed connection on Harris and accuse her of refusing to talk about marijuana, even though her platform included legalization.",
      "Harris aides made a final stab, offering to let Rogan talk with the vice president in Washington, D.C., the day after a closing-argument speech at the foot of the White House. Rogan\u2019s team balked, citing the Austin-only condition.",
      "Flaherty had seen enough. \u201cYou get one trip to Texas within three weeks of the election,\u201d he told Rogan\u2019s associates. \u201cYou don\u2019t get two.\u201d",

She described him as a \u201cpredator\u201d who once delighted in a \u201cperverse scene of despair and violence,\u201d placing baby chickens and mice into a blender to feed his hawks.

      "Some of those duties, critics say, are in direct conflict with his longtime role leading Children\u2019s Health Defense, which has grown into one of the largest anti-vaccine organizations in the world. The group has taken legal action against the federal government in which he now wants to serve. Kennedy recently disclosed that as of December he was no longer chair of the group.",
      "One of Kennedy's most outspoken critics has been Trump's former vice president, Mike Pence, specifically on the issue of abortion. The scion of the Kennedy family, who initially ran as a Democrat against President Joe Biden before he registered as an independent, had said he embraced few restrictions on abortion.",
      "\u201cAbortion has been a notoriously divisive issue in America, but actually I see an emerging consensus \u2014 abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter,\u201d he said on X in May.\u00a0\u201cOnce the baby is viable outside the womb, it should have rights, and it deserves society\u2019s protection.\u201d",
      "Pence\u2019s group, Advancing American Freedom, has launched ads combating Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, saying he supports \u201cabortion on demand.\u201d",
      "Kennedy has drawn opposition on the left, too. A group called Protect Our Care has launched a \"Stop RFK WarRoom\" in which it provides some rapid response, research and overview of news coverage of Kennedy.",
      "Last week, Kennedy\u2019s many financial entanglements became public in a financial disclosure form he was compelled to file with the Senate. It opened a new line of questions, with some Democrats saying his potential payout in an ongoing court case involving the pharmaceutical giant Merck would be a direct conflict of interest should he be confirmed.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr. wants us to trust him to make healthcare decisions for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, he could make millions off of lawsuits against the same vaccine manufacturers he\u2019d regulate as health secretary,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cRFK Jr. can\u2019t keep Americans safe if he\u2019s busy lining his own pockets.\u201d",
      "A Kennedy spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about a potential conflict of interest.",
      "Kennedy disclosed last week that he intended to keep a stake in a potential payout for an ongoing case against Merck over the Gardasil vaccine, which protects against HPV. Kennedy is connected to the case through the WisnerBaum law firm.",
      "\u201cI am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm. I am not trying these cases, I am not an attorney of record for the cases, and I will not provide representational services in connection with the cases during my appointment to the position of Secretary,\u201d his filing read.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve officials are expected to leave interest rates steady when they emerge from their first policy meeting of the second Trump administration Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials are expected to leave interest rates steady when they emerge from their first policy meeting of the second Trump administration Tuesday. That would most likely frustrate President Donald Trump, who has sought to pressure the central bank to drive rates lower.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll demand that interest rates drop immediately,\u201d Trump said in wide-ranging remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, via videoconference last week. \u201cAnd likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us all over.\u201d",
      "The remarks extended Trump\u2019s habit of publicizing his views on monetary policy, which U.S. presidents have long avoided to maintain the Fed\u2019s autonomy from politics.",
      "\u201cI know interest rates much better than they do,\u201d he said in follow-up comments after his Davos address. He also renewed his criticism of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 and has promised not to remove before Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026.",
      "The Fed is set to announce its interest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday, followed by remarks by Powell around 2:30.",
      "The U.S. economy is in vastly different shape from when Trump left office in January 2021, with the country still gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic and bitter disputes over lockdown measures to combat it.",
      "After a pandemic-era run-up in prices that devastated many consumers\u2019 finances, inflation has largely been tamed at 2.9% as of December, though it has hovered for months above the Fed\u2019s 2% target rate. Unemployment edged down to 4.1% in December from 4.2% the month before after employers added over a quarter-million jobs, helping tamp down worries about a labor market that has remained sturdy even as it cools.",
      "Consumer spending, meanwhile, has held steady despite households\u2019 increasing focus on value. Gross domestic product \u2014 driven significantly by the consumption of goods and services \u2014 was shown in December to have grown by at least 3% for the second consecutive quarter.",
      "Analysts see those metrics, taken together, as signs that the economy is still humming along despite the inflation fight\u2019s difficult \u201clast mile\u201d and that it doesn\u2019t need a fresh boost from the Fed just yet. It has penciled in two rate cuts this year, but Wall Street doesn\u2019t expect the first to arrive Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt the Fed will keep rates as-is this week,\u201d Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, said in a statement. \u201cWhile many households and businesses have felt the pressure of this high rate environment, the economy remains strong. Consumer spending has remained robust, and is credited with maintaining this economic strength.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have issued cuts for three consecutive meetings, whittling their benchmark rate from a 20-year high range of 5.25%-5.5% down to the current 4.25%-4.5%. But economists say the delicate dance of keeping borrowing costs elevated enough to tame price growth without pushing the economy into a recession has grown more complicated. That\u2019s largely due to Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 particularly tariffs, with his first policy move on that front expected Saturday.",
      "Fed policymakers are \u201cin a particularly tricky situation\u201d now, Renter said. \u201cTalk of policies that carry additional inflationary risk carry more weight now that the new administration is in place and beginning work.\u201d",
      "As a result, the path for rate cuts this year is \u201cuncertain,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the financial firm RSM.",
      "\u201cFederal Reserve officials won\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s clear that the central bank\u2019s decisions this year will be shaped by the Trump administration\u2019s policies on trade and immigration,\u201d Brusuelas said in a note Tuesday. \u201cThese policies could lead to higher inflation, or, just as important, raise inflation expectations, which would put the Fed\u2019s long-held 2% inflation target at risk.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe are very concerned,\u201d said Dr. Michael Lipnick, an anesthesiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, whose work is dedicated to resolving how pulse oximeters perform on a variety of skin tones. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to figure out where the money is going to come from next.\u201d",

      "The future of that money is now in question. Just hours after he was sworn in for a second term last week, President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning DEI initiatives. While that order primarily focused on ways in which employees are hired, there is concern about spillover into pulse oximeter studies intended to expand the number of participants with darker skin tones.",
      "That is, how can researchers seek out people of color to fill gaps in research while adhering to new directives to stop focusing on race?",
      "Recent directives to halt scientific communications from federal health agencies have frustrated federal health scientists seeking clarity on whether they\u2019d be able to continue research. A request for comment from the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees all federal health agencies, was not immediately answered.",
      "\u201cI have spent probably 25 hours in the last week talking with my colleagues as we try to understand what these poorly written, obviously immoral and probably unlawful orders will actually mean,\u201d said Dr. Theodore Iwashyna, a critical care physician and professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "Iwashyna co-authored an influential 2020 study showing how pulse oximeters don\u2019t work as intended in Black patients.",
      "He described the anti-DEI initiatives as \u201can attack on the scientists who are most likely to do work to ensure pulse oximeters work better for everyone.\u201d",
      "Pulse oximeters are commonly used during routine checkups, seeking out oxygen-rich blood by shining a light through the fingertip. That light, however, also absorbs skin pigment. The more pigment a person has, the healthier they seem to be, often leading to faulty pulse oximeter readings in people with darker skin.",
      "While the racial disparities of pulse oximeters have been known for decades, in-depth research into the disparities reignited during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The FDA appears to be focused on finalizing guidelines for pulse oximeter manufacturers to address the issue. Earlier this month, the FDA issued\u00a0draft guidance\u00a0for manufacturers to drastically expand the skin tone varieties when testing their devices and demonstrate how they work equally for all skin pigments.",
      "Not all research on racial disparities of pulse oximeters is threatened. Dr. Andrew Goodwin at the Medical University of South Carolina is leading a massive effort to analyze possible racial differences in pulse oximetry readings in hospitalized patients.",
      "Goodwin\u2019s work is expected to continue because it\u2019s secured private funding from one of the biggest pulse oximeter manufacturers, Masimo.",
      "His research team has recruited nearly 200 patients so far. \u201cWe have a really robust distribution across skin pigment thus far in our preliminary data set,\u201d Goodwin said. Results aren\u2019t expected for several more years.",
      "The future of Lipnick\u2019s research, however, is unclear, even as he\u2019s moved his family from San Francisco to Kampala, Uganda, to set up a pulse oximetry lab to explore how pulse oximeters work on darker skin tones.",
      "His team has just begun applying for new federal funding.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re broke,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody at the intersection of health equity is like, \u2018What is about to happen?\u2019\u201d"

I\u2019ve got to do that because otherwise I somehow cheated myself,\u201d Winfrey said in September 2023 during a panel on Oprah Daily, called \u201cThe State of Weight.\u201d",
      "It was after that discussion that she changed her mind about using a weight-loss drug, Winfrey told People, calling it her \"biggest aha\" moment: \u201cI realized I\u2019d been blaming myself all these years for being overweight, and I have a predisposition that no amount of willpower is going to control.\u201d",
      "Frustration with her weight has \u201coccupied five decades of space\" in her brain, she noted.",
      "She shared a similar sentiment in a March 2024 interview on CNN's \"King Charles.\"",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t work out anymore. I can\u2019t climb any faster or run any faster. I was down to eating one meal a day. There\u2019s nothing else I can do,\u201d Oprah recalled of deciding to get some extra help with managing her weight.",
      "\u201cWhen I tell you how many times I have blamed myself because you think, \u2018I\u2019m smart enough to figure this out,\u2019 and then to hear all along, it\u2019s you fighting your brain,\" she added. \u201cThe one thing I hope people come away with is knowing that (obesity is) a disease and it\u2019s in the brain.\"",
      "How did Oprah lose weight?",
      "Winfrey has lost her latest weight using a weight-loss drug and with a healthy diet and exercising. She told People the weight-loss medication is just part of her regimen for maintaining a healthy weight.",
      "\u201cI know everybody thought I was on it, but I worked so damn hard. I know that if I\u2019m not also working out and vigilant about all the other things, it doesn\u2019t work for me,\u201d she said.",
      "The talk show host added that she eats her last meal at 4 p.m., drinks a gallon of water a day and uses the WeightWatchers principles of counting points.",
      "She's also been hiking 3 to 5 miles every day and doing a 10-mile hike on weekends, noting that she's been feeling \"stronger, more fit and more alive\" than she\u2019s felt in years.",
      "When asked about her transformation at the \"The Color Purple\" event, Winfrey didn\u2019t even mention a weight-loss drug.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s everything,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI intend to keep it that way. \u2026 I was on that treadmill today.\u201d",
      "Studies show that weight-loss drugs need to be part of a holistic approach, with some of the strongest results in patients who are also eating a healthy diet and exercising.",
      "Oprah's weight loss history",
      "Winfrey has struggled with her weight for decades, famously losing 67 pounds with a liquid diet in 1988 then regaining the weight as soon as she \u201creturned to real food,\u201d she recalled on Oprah.com.",
      "In the March 18 special, she said that she essentially \"starved\" herself for five months before gaining it all back.",
      "In 1992, Winfrey reached 237 pounds, the most she ever weighed, she said during the \u201cThe State of Weight\u201d panel discussion. She recalled feeling frustrated that no matter what she did, her body always wanted to go back to a certain weight.",
      "In 2019, Winfrey revealed she was diagnosed with pre-diabetes before doing WW. She then lost 42 pounds with the program, getting her blood sugar and blood pressure back into normal ranges.",
      "Her goal weight now is 160 pounds, though she told People it\u2019s \u201cnot about the number\u201d but about living \u201ca more vital and vibrant life.\u201d",
      "As she approached her 70th birthday, her No. 1 concern was her health, Winfrey said, noting she doesn\u2019t live with a fear of death, but with \u201ca conscious acknowledgment that it\u2019s possible at any time.\u201d",
      "\u201c(I) recognize what an absolute miracle it is that 70 years on, that heart\u2019s still pumping,\u201d she added.",
      "How do weight-loss drugs work?",
      "Ozempic and similar drugs work by mimicking the hormones the body releases when a person eats food, as TODAY.com previously reported. People have reduced appetite, and when they do eat, they feel full sooner.",
      "Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, targets one hormone, known as GLP-1. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, targets two different hormones, GIP and GLP-1, which can lead to even greater weight loss, research shows.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for people with obesity or those who have complications from being overweight. Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved to treat Type 2 diabetes.",
      "The most common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain and constipation. People self-inject the drugs once a week and have to keep taking them to maintain weight loss.",
      "Patients can expect to lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, says Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist who runs a weight-loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Using a weight-loss medication is \u201cin no way the easy way out,\u201d he notes.",
      "\u201cYou still have to improve your nutrition. You still have to stay active. You really have to stay quite consistent over time to achieve the results that are seen in the clinical studies,\u201d McGowan tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThe reason these new medications are such game changers is they really are effective, and it\u2019s quite remarkable to help someone who\u2019s tried oftentimes for years, decades, maybe their entire adult life, to lose weight.\u201d"

If they make a good deal, they pick who goes home next.",
      "If it sounds confusing, you're not alone. Shallow describes it as a \"game show within a game show\" \u2014 only with the \"goofiest name.\"",
      "\"Once you get past how silly the name of the show sounds, and you invest yourself in watching it, it's really fun,\" she says. \"It's different to anything I've ever done, and I've done a lot of these games.\"",
      "On the show, she's competing against 11 reality TV newcomers, plus two veterans: David Genat of \"Australian Survivor\" and Will Kirby of \"Big Brother.\"",
      "Shallow describes Genat as her \"male foil,\" citing their similar gameplay and an \"instant connection and respect for each other.\" In essence, she and Genat are playing their own game, from opposite ends of the \"Deal or No Deal Island\" beach.",
      "She's also formed connections with newbies like Phillip Solomon and Dickson Wong. Unlike past shows, Shallow says she's functioning like a coach.",

      "\"There's like a pre-show Parvati, a naive Parvati that played the first few seasons of 'Survivor' when I was very young,\" she says. \"Then I had a good chunk of time, maybe a solid decade, where I stepped out of reality television, and I had a whole life.\"",
      "She got married, welcomed a daughter, Ama, in 2018, got divorced, and in between, essentially figured out \"how to make life work for me,\" she says.",

      "Shallow says the book's alternate title was \"Torched,\" a play on the \"Survivor\" torches which, if snuffed, mark elimination from the game. Her editors thought it might be too much. But according to Shallow herself, \"the book is intense,\" starting from the story of her childhood.",
      "\"I grew up in a new age, sort of spiritual commune that was run a powerful and controlling guru,\" Shallow says. \"That's why I have a Hindu name, because she was naming the kids.\"",
      "From there, it chronicles her reality TV debut and her experience learning to reject expectations.",
      "\"The book is really a journey of claiming my power, going from being a people-pleaser, wanting to be liked, adapting myself to whatever I thought other people wanted me to be, to then burning all of that down, all of the ways I was trying to fit into society's expectations of me as a woman, as a girl, as a wife, as a mother,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I don't need to do that anymore.'\"",
      "She cites using different \"healing modalities\" over a period of about four years, including about two-and-a-half years of writing the memoir.",
      "\"I was like, 'I need to find a way to make healthy choices because I want to have healthy relationships. I want to build a life that I love that works for me,'\" she says.",
      "Coming out on the other side, she's \"saying yes to these big adventures,\" including more reality TV appearances. She says her season of \"The Traitors,\" which aired in 2024, was a \"test,\" to see if she could truly step back into a game setting and not lose herself in the process.",

      "\"That's it for me. This book is closed on 'Survivor,'\" she says. \"So if people want to see me play 'Survivor,' this is your last opportunity.\"",
      "She adds that she \"wouldn't do 'Survivor 50,'\" the upcoming landmark 50th season of the show. The milestone season will reportedly feature returning cast members and start filming in the spring of 2025.",
      "\"40 ('Winners at War') was not the best experience for me as far as like making alliances and being able to play,\" Shallow says. \"I don't think the new era of 'Survivor' players wants to play with me. So I'm like, 'I can't play a game if no one wants to play with me.' I just don't even want to put myself in that situation.\"",

      "\"(Cirie) and I were in this tightest alliance in that game. And then there was this twist where we got surprised by it being a final two rather than a final three,\" Shallow says. \"So it was really interesting to see her there. I was like, 'Are we going to have the same dynamic as we had in 'Micronesia,' or is it going to be different?'\"",
      "\"It was really fun playing with her,\" Shallow says.",
      "With \"Deal or No Deal Island\" and \"Australian Survivor\" having already been filmed, now, Shallow gets to watch the final cuts, a process she says is \"more fun\" compared to the beginning of her reality TV career.",
      "\"I have less attachment to how I'm perceived,\" Shallow says.",

      "Season 2 of the hit series had viewers gasping, theorizing, dissecting fashion and dreaming of Sicily, all while trying to solve which character winds up dead.",
      "Creator Mike White told Entertainment Weekly in November 2023, nearly a year after the Season 2 finale of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d aired, that viewers can expect Season 3 to be even \u201ccrazier.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a supersized\u00a0\u2018White Lotus,\u2019\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be longer, bigger, crazier. I don\u2019t know what people will think, but I am super excited, so at least for my own barometer, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",
      "Natasha Rothwell, who starred in Season 1 and is set to return in Season 3, echoed the hype, revealing during an interview with Vanity Fair in December 2023 that she \u201cgasped\u201d while reading the scripts.",
      "\u201cI gasped out loud a minimum of five times, and this was just me reading them,\u201d Rothwell said. \u201cThe scripts are a testament to Mike\u2019s skill and ability to tell the most smart and entertaining stories. I mean, everything that he does is like a lesson to me as an actor and a performer. And as a writer myself, he takes folks on a journey. Everyone needs to buckle up, because it\u2019s going to get real!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d first premiered in July 2021 and has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, including one for outstanding limited series.",
      "\"What happens in Thailand, stays in Thailand,\" the characters say in the trailer for Season 3. Here's what we know so far about the next season of the award-winning series.",
      "When is the release date for Season 3 of 'The White Lotus'?",
      "HBO announced that Season 3 of \"The White Lotus\" will premiere on Feb. 16, 2025.",
      "Unlike the first two seasons, which had six and seven episodes each, respectively, the third season has eight episodes, meaning the finale episode is set to air on April 6, 2025.",

      "TODAY.com confirmed in April 2023 that Rothwell, who played spa manager Belinda in Season 1, will also return. Rothwell\u2019s return as Belinda continues the anthology series\u2019 subtle pattern of bringing back one\u00a0familiar face amid an all-new cast each season.",
      "White\u00a0had told Entertainment Weekly\u00a0he was open to cast members returning for Season 3 \u2014 and beyond.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to just be full-on anthology, but I think it\u2019s more fun to have little threads through the show,\u201d said White.\u00a0\u201cIf the show goes on for a couple of seasons, it would be fun to have an all-star season.\u201d",
      "Fans of the show know that its cast changes every season \u2014 with the exception of Jennifer Coolidge, who played the wealthy and somewhat stunted Tanya McQuoid, and Jon Gries, who played Tanya\u2019s husband, Greg Hunt, in Seasons 1 and 2.",
      "After Tanya\u2019s stunning demise in Season 2, it seemed unlikely Coolidge would return, though she said during Variety\u2019s \u201cActors on Actors\u201d series that she hopes creator White isn\u2019t done with Greg\u2019s character arc.",
      "\u201cMy hope for (co-star) Jon (Gries) is that he\u2019s not finished with Greg,\u201d Coolidge said. \u201cI hope there\u2019s some comeuppance for evil Greg. I think he should, I don\u2019t know, end up in a meat-grinding machine.\u201d",
      "In her speech after winning the Emmy Award for best supporting actress in a drama series in 2024 for her performance as Tanya, Coolidge said White called her character \u201cdefinitely dead.\u201d",

      "Where will Season 3 take place?",
      "Certain things about \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d are not expected to change \u2014 starting with the format. Each season takes place in a different White Lotus luxury resort located around the world, and begins with the discovery of a dead body.",
      "The first season was in Hawaii; the second, Sicily. And the third will be filmed in Thailand. (Though Meghann Fahy\u2019s character, Daphne, mentioned in the Season 2 finale that she wanted to vacation in the Maldives, leading fans to speculate that the show would be set in the island nation next.)",
      "The show\u2019s first two seasons were shot at Four Seasons resorts in Hawaii and Italy. Season 3 was filmed in Koh Samui, Phuket and Bangkok, per the Tourism Authority of Thailand.",
      "The Thailand news came after White teased continental and thematic changes for the third season.",
      "\u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in an\u00a0interview with HBO\u00a0that aired right after the Season Two finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.\u201d",
      "White also hinted at pivoting to a country in Asia during a red carpet interview with Deadline in October 2022.",
      "\u201cWe just turned in our last episode to the network, so it\u2019s hard to think about the next race,\u201d White said. \u201cBut if we did, I think it\u2019d be fun to maybe go to a whole different continent. We did Europe. Maybe Asia ... would be fun.\u201d",
      "What is known about the plot?",
      "The only official information out about the plot of third season is the logline for the series, which reads, \"The social satire is set at an exclusive Thai resort and follows the exploits of various guests and employees over the span of a week.\"",
      "In addition to what White has teased about taking a \u201csatirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality\u201d in the upcoming season, he also told Entertainment Weekly in September 2022 that he might return to his original idea he\u2019d pitched for Season 2, which has to do with politics and power.",
      "\u201cI might still do it down the road maybe, if they give us a third season,\u201d White told the outlet.",
      "After visiting Sicily, White decided to change the plot to fit the \u201cvibe\u201d of the country.",
      "\u201cThe kind of mythology of Sicily, at least from the point of view of Americans, is the archetypal sexual politics and role play that you associate with, like, opera and the mafia and Italian romance. I felt like it should be more focused on men and women and relationships and adultery and have an operatic feel to it, so I pivoted,\u201d\u00a0White said."

    "summary": "Will Ferrell was surprised with the viral animatronic Buddy the Elf during an appearance on the TODAY show on Jan. 28.",
    "story": [
      "Will Ferrell came face to face with \"Buddy the Elf, the ax murderer,\" and he may never be the same.",
      "The \"Elf\" star got a firsthand look at the life-size, animatronic Buddy the Elf decoration inspired by his iconic holiday movie when Craig Melvin and Savannah Guthrie surprised him with it on TODAY on Jan. 28.",
      "Ferrell turned around on the couch in Studio 1A to see the viral holiday contraption that seemed more suited to a haunted house than a Christmas display.",
      "Ferrell told Craig and Savannah he saw stories about the $199 animatronic elf sold at Home Depot during the holidays, calling the replica of his famous character \"disturbing.\" Then he saw it in person.",
      "\"Oh my God, it\u2019s Buddy the Elf, the ax murderer,\" Ferrell said.",
      "The elf then recited one of Ferrell's quotes from the movie in an eerie, robotic voice.",
      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say it? I\u2019m the worst toymaker in the world. I\u2019m a cotton-headed ninny muggins,\" the animatronic Buddy said.",
      "\"It\u2019s chilling,\" Ferrell said. \"Is this the Halloween show? Here\u2019s what\u2019s crazy \u2014 someone signed off on that, and it wasn\u2019t me.\"",
      "Ferrell then jokingly escorted the talking elf off the set. Craig and Savannah urged him to take it home on his flight back to California.",
      "\"I think that'll fit in the overhead,\" he joked.",
      "Ferrell gave people a look at the real Buddy over the holidays when he hilariously dressed up as a down-on-his-luck version of the character while attending a Los Angeles Kings hockey game with his family. The \"You're Cordially Invited\" star was unshaven with a cigarette dangling from his mouth while dressed as Buddy.",
      "\"I think Buddy got laid off,\" he said on TODAY. \"I just told my wife, \u2018You know what, I want to go to a Kings game and just dress as Buddy the Elf with a cigarette. That\u2019s it.'",
      "\"She just is like, \u2018OK.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, 'And you can\u2019t smile, you can\u2019t break.' That\u2019s why in a lot of the photos she\u2019s like this (holding her chin) trying not to laugh. My family indulges me in strange moments.\"",
      "It was Ferrell's latest endearing public moment, joining the time he served as a DJ for a fraternity party at USC and his epic drum-off with doppelganger Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.",
      "\"They usually just come to me,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just kind of a way to connect with the audience. And I love the fact that half the people are like, 'What is he doing?'\""

I can help you.\u2019 I look at my friends and said, \u2018The good news is, we\u2019re going to get a table real fast. The bad news is, this guy is going to be sitting with us.\u2019\u201d",

      "In that same interview with King, he noted, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a good marriage, and there\u2019s nothing like having children.\u201d",
      "He and Melania Trump welcomed son Barron one year into their marriage.",

This kindness is not always noted, but it is there for all to see. That is one reason I fell in love with him to begin with.\u201d",
      "And the appreciation is clearly mutual.",
      "In a social media post in honor of the first lady\u2019s 48th birthday, in 2018, the president wrote, \u201cMelania is my rock and foundation, and I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today without her by my side. She\u2019s the cornerstone of our family, and an incredible mother to our son, Barron. I\u2019m so proud of her accomplishments, and I hope you\u2019ll wish her well on her special day.\u201d"

    "summary": "Will Ferrell has a lot of fun with his wife, Viveca Paulin, and their three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 18, and Axel, 15. Here are 9 stories about his parenting.",
    "story": [
      "In his latest movie, \u201cYou\u2019re Cordially Invited\u201d with Reese Witherspoon, comedian and actor Will Ferrell plays an overly involved father of the bride. In real life, he is the father of three sons.",
      "In both instances, he has more than a few dad jokes up his sleeve.",
      "Ferrell seems to greatly enjoy tormenting his wife, Viveca Paulin, and their three sons: Magnus, 20, Mattias, 18, and Axel, 15. And they don't seem to mind ... or at least they've grown accustomed to it over the years.",
      "Recently, Ferrell dressed up as a disgruntled Buddy the Elf for a Philadelphia Flyers-Los Angeles Kings hockey game.",
      "Or perhaps you've seen the indelible image of Ferrell dressed as a medieval lord to upstage his son for prom photos.",
      "There was that time Ferrell showed up at a fraternity party at the University of Southern California (where his son was a sophomore at the time) as the guest DJ, clapping along to the \u201cRocky III\u201d classic \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d by Survivor and songs by Jay-Z and Ye.",
      "And of course, Ferrell perfected work-life balance way back in 2013 when he brought his ... ahem ... casually dressed kids on stage to announce some of the biggest Emmy Award winners of the night.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith dropped out at the last second and they called me literally 45 minutes ago and I couldn\u2019t find child care, OK?\u201d Ferrell told the audience at the time. \u201cWe had a soccer game, there was a neighbor\u2019s birthday party, a nut allergy, I didn\u2019t have time to do my hair. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s great to be here.\u201d",
      "Here are more of Ferrell's thoughts on the parenting journey.",
      "1. Will Ferrell on discipline",
      "While visiting \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in 2015, Ferrell, dressed as Little Debbie of snack cake fame, told Jimmy Fallon that he only disciplines his sons as Little Debbie.",
      "\u201cSo if I come around the corner dressed like this, they know it\u2019s business,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cMy wife will say, \u2018Don\u2019t make Dad change into Little Debbie!\u2019\u201d",
      "2. Will Ferrell on gentle parenting",
      "\"As a parent of three boys, it's a lot of chaos. And all parenting rules go completely out the window,\" Ferrell told Jennifer Anniston during a 2020 interview for \"The Ellen Show.\"",
      "He joked that within five minutes, he went from saying, \"'I'm sorry your feelings are hurt'\" to \"'Get upstairs now and brush your teeth! Shut up! I don't care. Why? Because I said so!'\"",
      "Ferrell added that parenting boys is \"like running a small correctional facility.\"",
      "3. Will Ferrell on encouraging humor",
      "In a 2018 interview with Parade, Ferrell said that his kids are each \"funny in their own ways.\"",
      "For example, when he was a freshman in high school, Magnus borrowed a friend's glasses and put on a serious look for his yearbook photo. He was worried that he would get in trouble, but Ferrell said, \"\u2018No, you\u2019ve got to do it every year! Fantastic!\u2019\"",
      "Ferrell added, \"It\u2019s fun to see them make their friends laugh. Very similar to me, they\u2019re good kids at school and yet they like to try to be funny.\"",
      "4. Will Ferrell on connection",
      "As a father, Ferrell values quality, not quantity.",
      "Back in 2008, he told People, \u201cFor me, talk to your children, at least once a week. If you\u2019ve got time, do it two or three times a week, but otherwise, I find the times where I let weeks and weeks go by without talking to my children. That adds up.\u201d",
      "Ferrell has seemingly kept that distance from his children through the years.",
      "While promoting their 2017 movie, \"The House,\" Ferrell sat down with co-star Amy Poehler to talk about parenting. Poehler asked why parents have to be their kids' best friend these days.",
      "Ferrell deadpanned, \"I know I'm not my kids' best friend. Not by a long shot.\"",
      "5. Will Ferrell on playdates",
      "When visiting \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\" in 2018, Ferrell schooled Corden and a very pregnant Eva Longoria about the long-term effect of boys' bathroom habits.",
      "\"It continues on, the issue,\" he said. \"Peeing ... in a stranger way.\"",
      "Because his wife is Swedish, Ferrell and his family visit the Swedish countryside every summer. When they are outside playing soccer, there's no bathroom nearby, so the boys \"pee out in nature.\"",
      "Unfortunately, though, that habit has continued at the Ferrell home back in the U.S.",
      "\"There's been many a playdate where the scared mother who's visiting us with their child leave immediately because our children just decided to pee in the backyard \u2014 and have convinced them to pee in the backyard.\"",
      "6. Will Farrell on coaching",
      "Ferrell's boys played with the American Youth Soccer Organization, which requires parents to earn \"volunteer points\" by refereeing, Ferrell said on \"The Ellen Show\" in 2020.",
      "He generally makes it through half of the game before one of the kids on the opposing team asks if he's \"Buddy the Elf,\" his character in the hit holiday movie \"Elf.\" Ferrell then uses the distraction to give his kids a leg up on the competition.",
      "But that isn't the only mark Ferrell has made on youth soccer.",
      "According to The Hollywood Reporter, visual effects artist Justin\u00a0Blaustein, whose son played with Ferrell's son, said that the comedian \"often showed up for practice in crazy Hawaiian print shirts, long shorts, black socks and a 10-gallon cowboy hat.\"",
      "7. Will Farrell on holidays",
      "Ferrell's son Magnus has said that Easter in their household has been ... interesting.",
      "On the \"Lightweights Podcast with Joe Vulpis,\" Magnus shared a story about his mother waking him up to look in the backyard where there was \"a guy in an Easter Bunny costume, and he's just kind of trotting around, kind of bizarre, and he's making this weird face and he's singing this Easter Bunny song.\"",
      "Magnus added that his father \"is someone who has no shame. No shame. It feels like social anxiety is afraid of him.\"",
      "At Christmas, Ferrell plays the Swedish Santa, Tomten, for their annual Christmas party. He gives a present to each child ... but only if they earn it. If the kids are too nervous to perform, Tomten makes them do five push-ups.",
      "And at Halloween, the Ferrell family has a standing tradition: Ferrell will wear whatever costume his family chooses for him, according to People.",
      "One year, he was a poop emoji.",
      "8. Will Ferrell on supporting his kids",
      "Ferrell is always there for his kids with more cowbell.",
      "9. Will Ferrell on the biggest lesson he's learned as a parent",
      "In a video interview from 2023, the Wall Street Journal asked Ferrell a question we all want to know the answer to: \"What's the one lesson you've learned as a parent?\"",
      "\"Being a parent is a huge responsibility,\" Ferrell began. \"You learn a lot of lessons, but the overriding lesson I've learned is that I hate children.\""

      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloane with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "The lawsuit, obtained by NBC News on Dec. 31, names Baldoni as well as Wayfarer Studios, Heath, Nathan and Abel.",
      "\"Earlier today, Ms. Lively filed a federal complaint against Wayfarer Studios and others in the Southern District of New York,\" attorneys for Lively said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"Ms. Lively previously sent her California Civil Rights Department Complaint in response to the retaliatory campaign Wayfarer launched against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns. Unfortunately, Ms. Lively\u2019s decision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks. As alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns.",
      "\"Now, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court. Ms. Lively has brought this litigation in New York, where much of the relevant activities described in the Complaint took place, but we reserve the right to pursue further action in other venues and jurisdictions as appropriate under the law.\"",
      "Lively\u2019s attorneys also sent the following comment to NBC News in response to Baldoni's lawsuit against The New York Times.",
      "\u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis lawsuit is based on the obviously false premise that Ms. Lively\u2019s administrative complaint against Wayfarer and others was a ruse based on a choice \u2018not to file a lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer,\u2019 and that \u2018litigation was never her ultimate goal.\u2019\u00a0As demonstrated by the federal complaint filed by Ms. Lively earlier today, that frame of reference for the Wayfarer lawsuit is false.\u00a0While we will not litigate this matter in the press, we do encourage people to read Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint in its entirety. We look forward to addressing each and every one of Wayfarer\u2019s allegations in court.\u201d",
      "Jan. 3, 2025: Baldoni's attorney says they plan to sue Lively",
      "Freedman, Baldoni's attorney, said that his client's legal action against The New York Times \"will not be the last lawsuit\" in his legal battle against Lively during an interview on TODAY aired on Jan. 3.",
      "When asked if his client planned to file a lawsuit against Lively, Freedman replied, \"Absolutely.\"",
      "\u201cWe plan to release every single text message between the two of them,\u201d Freedman said. \u201cThere is nothing that in any way is a concern about this entire situation from our perspective, and we want the truth to be out there.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Lively did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News on Freedman's interview.",
      "Jan. 16, 2025: Baldoni sues Lively for defamation",
      "Baldoni filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court on Jan. 16, accusing Lively, Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and Sloane's PR firm of defamation and other contractual claims.",
      "The 179-page complaint accuses Lively of taking creative control over her character, refusing to promote the film unless she got to produce her own edits of the movie and more.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni also allege in the suit that Lively's team worked to smear Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios.",
      "Lively\u2019s legal team said in a statement to NBC News on Jan. 16 that the lawsuit was \u201canother chapter in the abuser playbook.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Lively\u2019s legal team said Baldoni and Wayfarer \u201care trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni. The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony\u2019s cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\u201d",
      "The statement concluded: \u201cThe strategy of attacking the woman is desperate, it does not refute the evidence in Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint, and it will fail.\u201d",
      "Jan. 21, 2025: Attorney for Baldoni releases raw video footage from 'It Ends With Us'",
      "Freedman released nearly 10 minutes of behind-the-scenes footage, which is only shown in the film in a slow-motion montage, on Jan. 21.",
      "Baldoni's attorneys said that the three takes shown in the video don't match Lively's allegations of sexual harassment filed in a legal complaint in December 2024.",
      "Lively's legal team said in a statement to NBC News on Jan. 21 that the footage corroborates her account of what happened.",
      "\u201cThe video shows Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character,\u201d Lively's legal team said. \u201cEvery moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\u00a0Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively\u2019s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively\u2019s boss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe video shows Ms. Lively leaning away and repeatedly asking for the characters to just talk. Any woman who has been inappropriately touched in the workplace will recognize Ms. Lively\u2019s discomfort,\u201d her legal team continued. \u201cThey will recognize her attempts at levity to try to deflect the unwanted touching. No woman should have to take defensive measures to avoid being touched by their employer without their consent.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for Lively said releasing the video to the media, rather than presenting it as evidence in court, was \u201canother example of an unethical attempt to manipulate the public\u201d and was \u201ca continuation of their harassment and retaliatory campaign.\u201d",
      "Jan. 27, 2025: Trial date set for March 2026",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Lewis J. Liman wrote in an order on Jan. 27 that Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios will be joined with Baldoni's lawsuit against Lively, and that both cases will go to trial on March 9, 2026, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Liman also rescheduled a pretrial conference to Feb. 3, 2025, in which the parties will discuss a motion regarding pretrial publicity and attorney conduct, according to the order.",
      "Attorneys for Lively wrote a letter to the judge on Jan. 27 asking for a gag order to be put in place after Baldoni's attorney Freedman allegedly made false statements about Lively in the media.",
      "\"The endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end. It will not stop without this Court\u2019s intervention,\" attorneys for Lively wrote in the letter.",
      "Freedman responded to the letter in a lengthy statement to NBC News on Jan. 27.",
      "\"We will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\" he said in the statement. \"All we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations of sexual harassment and subsequent smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for Lively did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on the trial date.",
      "CORRECTION:\u00a0(Jan. 2, 2024, 3:12 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated when The New York Times published an article about Blake Lively's claims. It was on Dec. 21, not Dec. 20."

    "story": [
      "After two decades of releasing chart-topping hits, Miranda Lambert has certainly earned the right to be called a country superstar. Now, her icon status has officially been solidified.",
      "At the\u00a02024 People\u2019s Choice Country Awards, the singer received the Country Icon Award, an accolade that came hot on the heels of the release of her 10th studio album.",
      "Aptly named \"Postcards from Texas,\" it's the first album Lambert has made in Texas since she was 18 years old.",
      "\"It felt really full circle,\" she said of the experience while talking with TODAY's Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager in September 2024.",
      "While reflecting on her Country Icon Award, the singer, now 41, said it feels \"crazy\" to think that she's an icon at this point in her life.",
      "\u201cI feel like some days I\u2019m just getting started in some ways. So to already have an icon status, it means the world. But it\u2019s also like, \u2018All right, well I got to uphold this. So I got to keep going,'\u201d she said.",
      "Before appearing on TODAY's fourth hour at that time, Lambert sat down with TODAY.com to answer eight questions before 8 a.m. in\u00a0our original video series \u201c8 Before 8.\u201d",
      "From personal to professional questions, Lambert didn't hold back in her responses. She dished on country icons who inspire her, her favorite tattoo and her new album. Plus, she assessed husband Brendan McLoughlin's songwriting abilities.",
      "How did you come up with the name of your album 'Postcards from Texas'?",
      "The name \"Postcards from Texas\" kind of felt right for the record because there are so many influences on this record that have sort of made me who I am as an artist musically. And I felt like each was a little snapshot of the last 20 years of inspiration.",
      "What was the inspiration for your new song 'Wranglers'?",
      "My new song \"Wranglers\" was written by my good friend Audra Mae, and I think the inspiration was just life and girl talk. We were talking about experiences we had had, and we were writing songs and drinking tequila.",
      "And then a month later she sent me \"Wranglers,\" and she was like, \"I took our stories and I wrote them. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\" So I just love it. It\u2019s like \u2014 it really reminds me of something I would've put on some of my earlier records.",
      "What music icons have inspired you over the years?",
      "So many people have inspired me, but country, specifically. The obvious ones: Dolly (Parton) and Reba (McEntire) because they are our queens, Loretta Lynn. But on this record, specifically, I feel like George Strait had a lot of influence for me. We call him the king in Texas for a reason.",
      "\u2018Wranglers\u2019 is a total revenge anthem. What\u2019s the wildest thing you\u2019ve done to get revenge on an ex?",
      "I feel like anything that I\u2019ve ever done for revenge, I\u2019ve written in a song. So if you want the answers, you\u2019ll have to listen to the records.",
      "Describe the process of writing 'Dammit Randy' with your husband.",
      "I did write a song with my husband called \"Dammit Randy\" on this record. I had my husband writing songs here in 2020 when we were all home and bored, and he actually turned out to be pretty good. He is a retired NYPD officer, so songwriting is not his (thing). Now, he has it on his resume because he\u2019s really proud.",
      "We were kind of wrapping up songs for this record, and my friend Jon Randall picked up a guitar and that usually means we\u2019re going to write a song. And Brendan was watching football and kind of kept popping lines in. And so I was like, \"If you\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re not going to watch the game and write songs. You got to pick a side.\" And so, he ended up writing some of my favorite lines in the song.",
      "You got married after 3 months of dating. How did you know your husband was the one?",
      "You know, my husband\u2019s my person, and it\u2019s taken a journey to get there and figure that out. But I\u2019m also a person that really believes in love and taking a risk. And if you don\u2019t, you know, I know that loving big can also mean hurting big. But to me, it\u2019s definitely worth it.",
      "This is your 10th studio album. What are 10 things you can\u2019t live without?",
      "Ten things I can\u2019t live without: Dogs, dogs, country music, my husband. Not in that order. I should have probably put him before the dogs, but he would expect nothing less. Tito's and Cheetos and girl time. Can\u2019t live without girl time. And cowboy boots and Texas Longhorns.",
      "Rapid-fire round:",
      "Probably my favorite tattoo is my guns and wings on my left arm. It\u2019s my logo, and it was my first big tattoo, and I got it when my record \"Kerosene\" went gold. So it definitely means something to me.",
      "My favorite recipe from my cookbook is probably my mom\u2019s meatloaf because it\u2019s famous. Well, she calls it famous, so, so do we.",
      "Hmm, I loved the (Las) Vegas residency so much. It was such a different way of doing what I do versus being on the road for 20 years. But it did make me miss the road. So I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, I think having a balance of a residency and the road was kind of the perfect storm.",
      "Oh, man, I can\u2019t choose between horses or dogs. It\u2019s just impossible. I\u2019ll have to take a shot.",
      "Well, all I watch is police shows and cooking shows. So \"SVU\" (\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\"), I\u2019m like a die-hard Olivia (Benson, Mariska Hargitay) fan.",
      "Date night in.",
      "My go-to drink to order at the bar in Nashville is, I think it\u2019s the Something Bad. It's our spicy Margarita.",
      "Oh God, \"Love Is Blind.\" I just binge it for sure.",
      "I collect salt-and-pepper shakers. I know it\u2019s very Memaw of me, but I\u2019m owning it.",
      "Ooh, not enough!",
      "I'd pick Dolly."

      "Idina Menzel and her 15-year-old son Walker Diggs were all smiles at the Los Angeles premiere of \u201cWicked\u201d on Nov. 9.\u00a0But Menzel says she thought long and hard before allowing her son to join her on the red carpet.",
      "\"I never let him ever go on the red carpet with me,\" actress and singer Menzel explains backstage at TODAY after she performed a song from her new Broadway show, \"Redwood,\" in Studio 1A.",
      "\"He\u2019s gotten to the age where he says, 'I\u2019m proud of you, Mom. I want to be with you.' So then I felt like it was OK.\"",
      "Even now, Menzel debates whether she should have let her son attend.",
      "\"I believe his anonymity is so important and yet he\u2019s a teenager, and it was a hard decision to be honest, you know? But he really wanted to,\" she says. \"I\u2019m proud of him, so I loved showing him off. But as a parent, I\u2019m still conflicted about it.\"",
      "Menzel shares Walker with her ex-husband, Taye Diggs, who also stepped out with his son the following month. The former couple, who met while starring in the original Broadway production of \u201cRent,\u201d parted ways in 2013, after 10 years of marriage. Menzel has been married to Aaron Lohr, an actor-turned-therapist, since 2017.",

      "Walker is homeschooling this year so that he can travel between California and New York to spend time with all of his parents. \"I can\u2019t be away from him for more than a couple weeks. I\u2019m too controlling,\" Menzel laughs.",
      "Clearly, Menzel adores Walker.",
      "Ever since he was little, Walker would hang out with his mom backstage, putting on face paint in the mirror while she got ready for a performance. \"He was just like the kid backstage, and everybody knew him,\" she says, noting that he even went trick-or-treating at every dressing room. Walker has also joined her on tour in Japan, Korea and London.",
      "\"He's my guy,\" she says proudly. \"And he's a very soulful, intuitive kid. He's the best thing ever happened to me, really.\"",
      "Parenting and performing schedules can often conflict. \"For a working mom, it's always complicated no matter what age your kid is,\" Menzel says, but it's important for her to show Walker that she's pursuing work that she loves, to inspire him to do the same. \"I want to mirror that for him for his own life.\"",
      "Menzel, who performed in \"Redwood\" last year at La Jolla Playhouse in California, said she is thrilled to officially open the show at the Nederlander Theater on Broadway next month.",
      "\"When you get lightning in a bottle, you just got to go,\" she says. \"My husband and my son are so supportive.\"",
      "In \"Redwood,\" Menzel plays a woman who just went through a family tragedy and finds herself at the foot of the redwoods in Northern California. The show emphasizes our need for connection.",
      "\"We need to be able to hold each other up and support each other, just like the redwoods,\" Menzel shares. \"It's a beautiful metaphor for a life I'd like to lead, and a world that I hope my son can grow up in.\""

      "DeepSeek also appears to censor topics or express specific political leanings when responding to some questions about China.",
      "When asked about the sovereignty of Taiwan, a self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory, DeepSeek\u2019s R1 sometimes states the subject is \u201cbeyond my current scope.\u201d Other times, the model describes Taiwan as \u201can inalienable part of China\u2019s territory,\u201d adding: \u201cWe firmly oppose any form of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland through peaceful means.\u201d",

    "summary": "Multiple defectors from North Korea spoke to NBC News about the mindset of soldiers sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",

    "story": [
      "O\u015aWI\u0118CIM, Poland \u2014 The Soviet Red Army troops who arrived here on Jan. 27, 1945, helped uncover one of the greatest atrocities ever committed by \u2014 and against \u2014 humankind.",
      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that this is the last milestone anniversary where we\u2019ll have a visible group of survivors who are still able to tell us their stories,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Sawicki, deputy spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, said in an interview at the camp Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe choice for this year\u2019s anniversary was very simple: We need to put them into the spotlight,\u201d he added.",
      "In recent statements, Western heads of state have tried to underscore the importance of preserving the historical memory of the Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah.",
      "\u201cI am against turning the page, saying that was long ago,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a gathering of the Jewish community in Frankfurt this month. \u201cWe keep alive the memory of the civilizational split of the Shoah committed by Germans, which we pass down to each generation in our country again and again.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the grounds of Auschwitz on Jan. 17, describing the \u201csheer horror\u201d he felt there and vowing to fight the rising tide of antisemitism in his country.",
      "Roughly 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps attended Monday\u2019s commemoration. In recent days, hundreds of visitors from around the world have come to the former camp to pay their respects.",
      "Josh Sesar, 52, of Los Angeles, who made his second trip to Auschwitz on Friday, said he believed it is vital to see the grounds firsthand.",
      "\u201cI think it is not taught enough in school in America, and if you watch the news in America now, you see the philosophies that people are following now and they are happy to pretend that this never happened,\u201d Sesar said.",
      "\u201cIt is scary, because there are not so many survivors left, and so when there [are] no survivors, people even more so try to discredit history,\u201d he added.",
      "Aron Krell, 98, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and ultimately liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, said it is incumbent on Jewish people, educators, historians and other advocates to keep the legacy of the Shoah intact.",
      "In a video interview last week, Krell described his liberation as his \u201csecond birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the light again in front of me,\u201d Krell said. \u201cMy second birthday is more important, really, than the first. We always celebrate it: Aron Krell has two birthdays.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 All over Europe, there are signs of a continent steeling itself for the unthinkable.",
      "Lithuania plans to lay mines on its bridges to Russia, ready to detonate should Kremlin tanks try to cross. In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

      "BEIJING \u2014 For women in China, it may feel as if there is little to laugh about these days.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic, and the government is cracking down on feminist activism as it encourages women to embrace \u201ctraditional\u201d female roles as wives and mothers.",
      "But women were laughing nonetheless, as amateur performers told jokes about office and family life to a small but engaged audience of about 20 people, mostly young women, at a Western restaurant in Beijing on a recent winter evening.",
      "Alex Wang, the only female performer out of about half a dozen that night, said she felt \u201cempowered\u201d when she first got on stage a few years ago.",
      "Though \u201cbeing funny is the most important thing,\u201d she said in an interview after her performance, \u201cI want to grow not just as a comedian but as a woman finding her voice in this space.\u201d",
      "The growing role of women in China\u2019s stand-up scene, along with the recent success of funny female-oriented films, reflect one way feminism is breaking into the Chinese mainstream: through comedy.",
      "The feminist movement is facing strong resistance in China, even as women attain new educational heights and make strides in the workplace.",
      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

      "It served as the background for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s 2017 presidential victory speech. On Tuesday, he returned to the Louvre to attempt some damage control after a leaked memo raised alarms about the dire state of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Macron announced that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will \u201cbe installed in a special space, accessible independently of the rest of the museum,\u201d which he said will be renovated and expanded in a major overhaul.",
      "Speaking in the room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed, Macron said a new entrance to the museum would be built near the River Seine and underground rooms would also be created.",
      "While he did not disclose the cost, it is estimated that it could run into hundreds of millions of euros.",
      "One of the ways of financing the project could be to raise prices for visitors from outside the European Union, he said. \u201cAnother way of financing the project is to increase the number of visitors to 12 million a year,\u201d he added.",
      "Macron visited the museum days after Le Parisien newspapers reported on a confidential memo that the Louvre's director, Laurence des Cars, sent to Culture Minister Rachida Dati.",
      "According to the newspaper, the director warned of \u201ca proliferation of damage to the museum\u2019s spaces, some of which are in a very poor condition.\u201d",

      "\u201cSince we have different areas every day, we\u2019re forced to close down areas due to the various problems that can arise in the building,\u201d she added.",
      "On Jan. 24, the Louvre's workers' union SUD Culture, in an angry statement, said the state of disrepair led to the unprecedented cancellation of an exhibition in 2023."

      "The Chinese startup DeepSeek has made waves after releasing AI models that experts say match or outperform leading American models at a fraction of the cost. The meteoric rise of the previously little-known company spooked U.S. investors Monday, wiping out almost $600 billion in the market value of American chipmaker Nvidia in the biggest drop in the nation's market history.",
      "In China, DeepSeek is being heralded as a symbol of the country\u2019s AI advancements in the face of U.S. export restrictions that Beijing says are aimed at suppressing its technological development.",
      "\u201cThis jaw-dropping breakthrough has come from a purely Chinese company,\u201d said Feng Ji, founder and chief executive of Game Science, the developer behind the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong.",
      "\u201cDeepSeek may be a national-level technological and scientific achievement,\u201d he wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "Zhou Hongyi, co-founder of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, said China would \u201cundoubtedly come out on top\u201d in the U.S.-China AI race.",
      "\u201cIf we are to counter America\u2019s AI tech dominance, DeepSeek will definitely be a key member of China\u2019s \u2018Avengers team,\u2019\u201d he said in a video on Weibo.",
      "So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation?",
      "Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies.",
      "Liang has said High-Flyer was one of DeepSeek\u2019s investors, though it\u2019s unclear how much it contributed, as well as a source of some of its first employees.",
      "\u201cOur core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,\u201d he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for \u201cdown-to-earth individuals with curiosity.\u201d",
      "By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year.",
      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",
      "Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies.",
      "The comparatively small spend by DeepSeek showed \"a lot of optimization and smart, capable engineering that can be implemented and deployed to keep up in this race,\" Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies, told NBC News.",
      "The surge in interest sent DeepSeek\u2019s recently released app to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations \u201cdue to large-scale malicious attacks\u201d on its services, CNBC reported.",
      "New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "The R1 model is now second only to California-based OpenAI\u2019s o1 in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. It also beats leading models by Google, Meta and the  California-based Anthropic.",
      "Liang, who according to the China's media is about 40, has kept a relatively low profile in the country, where there has been a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years amid concerns by the ruling Chinese Communist Party that its biggest companies and executives might be getting too powerful.",
      "But he appeared on state television last week during a high-profile meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, who invited Liang and other experts from technology, education, science and other fields to share their opinions for a draft government work report. At the meeting, Li called for \u201ctechnological innovation\u201d to foster the economy, according to state media reports.",
      "China has made AI a national priority, with the goal of becoming the global leader in its technology by 2030. The U.S., concerned about the potential military applications, has moved to limit China's access to American technology, including new restrictions on AI chips issued by Joe Biden in the final days of his presidency.",
      "President Donald Trump said Monday that DeepSeek\u2019s rise \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d for U.S. tech companies.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry referred a request for comment Tuesday to the relevant department.",
      "R1 has also drawn attention because, unlike OpenAI\u2019s o1, it is free to use and open-source, meaning anyone can study and copy how it was made.",
      "Most Chinese engineers are eager for their open-source projects to be used by foreign companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, in part because \u201cno one in the West respects what they do because everything in China is stolen or created by cheating,\u201d said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in AI.",
      "\u201cThey are also aware that Chinese firms have been taking for free lots of open-source tech to advance,\u201d Xu, the former senior director for global expansion at GitHub, said Monday in a post on X, \u201cbut they want to create their own, contribute, and prove that their tech is good enough to be taken for free by foreign firms \u2014 some nationalism, some engineering pride.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek is not the only Chinese AI startup that says it can train models for a fraction of the price. Kai-Fu Lee, founder of 01.AI, has said that it cost $3 million to train its model and that U.S. restrictions on chip exports forced his company to innovate.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese companies are able to watch the innovations, make some themselves and then do better engineering,\u201d Lee, a former president of Google China, said at a conference in Saudi Arabia in October.",

      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a statement said the hostage release \u2014 which will include soldier Agam Berger \u2014 will take place Thursday, and it confirmed that Palestinians can move north on Monday. Israel\u2019s military said people can start crossing on foot at 7 a.m.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Israel on Saturday was to begin allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, but it put that on hold because of Yehoud, who it said should have been released that day. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement.",

      "The ceasefire is aimed at ending the 15-month war triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack and freeing hostages still held in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Around 90 hostages are still in Gaza, and Israeli authorities believe at least a third, and up to half, have died.",
      "Itzik Horn, the father of hostages Iair and Eitan Horn, called any resumption of fighting \u201ca death sentence for the hostages\u201d and criticized government ministers who want the war to go on.",
      "The ceasefire\u2019s first phase runs until early March and includes the release of 33 hostages and nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. The second \u2014 and far more difficult \u2014 phase, has yet to be negotiated. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israel has threatened to resume its offensive until Hamas is destroyed.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. More than 100 were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023.

Seven have been freed in the latest ceasefire.",

      "\u201cThe trauma of the 2020 protests was so deep that Lukashenko this time decided not to take risks and opted for the most reliable option when balloting looks more like a special operation to retain power than an election,\u201d Belarusian political analyst Valery Karbalevich said.",

      "At home, early voting that began Tuesday has created fertile ground for irregularities with ballot boxes unguarded until election day, the opposition said. A record 41.81% of voters cast ballots in five days of early voting. Meanwhile, Viasna activists reported internet issues across the country, and alleged Lukashenko\u2019s government was blocking access to VPN services commonly used to evade censorship.",
