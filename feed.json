      "Top House Republicans are seeking documents and internal communications regarding President Joe Biden\u2019s statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Top House Republicans called on the White House to produce all documents and internal communications regarding President Joe Biden's statement earlier this week in which he appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump.",
      "White House press officials altered the official transcript of Biden's statement, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.",
      "The lawmakers said they question whether the decision to create \u201ca false transcript and manipulate or alter the accurate transcript\u201d produced for the National Archives and Records Administration was a violation of federal law.",
      "Rep. James Comer, the Republican chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik demanded the White House produce the records. They're also calling for the White House to make available for a briefing the top supervisor of the White House Stenography's Office.",
      "\u201cThe White House cannot simply rewrite President Biden\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d Comer and Stefanik wrote. \u201c...We are concerned with the latest reporting of the White House\u2019s apparent political decision to protect the Biden-Harris Administration, instead of following longstanding and proper protocols.\u201d",
      "Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, \u201cThe only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters \u2014 his \u2014 his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d",
      "The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading \u201csupporter\u2019s\u201d rather than \u201csupporters,\u201d which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president."

      "The debate over abortion rights is leading to expensive campaigns for state Supreme Courts in several states this year",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Abortion and reproductive rights have been central to the races for president and governor in North Carolina, a battleground state that has more moderate abortion restrictions than elsewhere across the South.",
      "That's been even truer in the fight for a seat on the state Supreme Court that abortion rights supporters say will play an important role in determining whether Republicans can enact even more restrictions. Registered Republicans currently hold five of seven seats and could expand that majority even further in Tuesday's election.",
      "Justice Allison Riggs, a Democrat who is running for reelection, is focusing heavily on the issue and touts her support for reproductive rights. Her first television ad featured images of Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the Republican nominee for governor, who prefers to restrict abortions earlier than the current 12 weeks. She says her GOP rival for the court could be a deciding vote on the bench for such restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that is landing in front of state Supreme Courts, and it is one that is very salient to voters now,\u201d Riggs said in an interview.",
      "Her Republican opponent, Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin, said Riggs is saying too much about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s an inappropriate manner, a clear violation of our judicial standards, our code of conduct,\u201d he said.",
      "The North Carolina race emphasizes how much abortion is fueling expensive campaigns for Supreme Courts in several states this year. Groups on the right and left are spending heavily to reshape courts that could play deciding roles in legal fights over abortion, reproductive rights, voting rights, redistricting and other hot-button issues for years to come.",
      "Experts say the campaigns show how the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning constitutional abortion protections that had been in place for half a century has transformed races for state high courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Dobbs did was made clear to both political stakeholders and the public that these state courts that hadn't got a lot of attention are actually going to be really important and they're going to be deciding some of the biggest cases that people might have expected to go to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",
      "Thirty-three states are holding elections for 82 Supreme Court seats this year. The 2024 election cycle follows record-breaking spending for judicial races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last year.",
      "Groups on the left have ramped up their spending on state courts considerably this year. The American Civil Liberties Union has spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "\u201cWe have never invested this heavily in state Supreme Courts before,\u201d said Katie Rodihan, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cThis is really a groundbreaking move for us, and I expect this will be the norm for us moving forward.\u201d",
      "The targets include Ohio, where Republicans hold a 4-3 majority on the court. Democrats are defending two seats on the court, while a third is open, and Democratic victories in all three races are considered a longshot in the Republican-leaning state.",
      "Control of the court could be key if the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the most far-reaching of the state's abortion restrictions. The ruling said the law banning most abortions once cardiac activity is detected \u2014 as early as six weeks into pregnancy and before many women know they\u2019re pregnant \u2014 violated a constitutional amendment approved by voters last year that protected reproductive rights.",
      "Two seats are up for election on Michigan's court, where Democratic-backed justices hold a 4-3 majority. Court races are technically nonpartisan, but candidates are nominated at party conventions. Republicans would need to win both seats to flip the court in their favor.",
      "Justice Kyra Harris Bolden is defending the seat she was appointed to two years ago by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Bolden was the first Black woman to sit on Michigan\u2019s bench. She faces Republican-backed circuit court Judge Patrick O\u2019Grady for the remaining four years of the eight-year term.",
      "Republican state Rep. Andrew Fink is competing against University of Michigan law professor Kimberly Anne Thomas, who was nominated by Democrats, for the other open seat that is being vacated by a Republican-backed justice.",
      "Michigan voters already have locked abortion rights in the state constitution, though groups backing Bolden and Thomas are framing the races as crucial to defending those rights, with one group\u2019s ad warning that \u201cthe Michigan state Supreme Court can still take abortion rights away.\u201d",
      "The most heated races are for two seats on the Montana Supreme Court, which has come under fire from GOP lawmakers over rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote.",
      "Former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch is running against county attorney Cory Swanson for chief justice, while state judge Katherine Bidegaray is running against state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups have been backing Lynch and Bidegaray. Both said in an ACLU questionnaire that they agreed with the reasoning and holding of a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that the constitutional right to privacy includes the right to obtain a pre-viability abortion.",
      "Groups on the right have been painting them both as too liberal and echoing national Republicans' rhetoric, with text messages invoking the debate over transgender athletes on women's sports teams.",
      "The Republican State Leadership Committee, a longtime player in state court races, said its Judicial Fairness Initiative planned to spend seven figures in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.",
      "The group's ads are focusing on issues other than abortion. In one touting three Republicans running for Ohio's court, the group shows images of President Donald Trump along with images related to immigration.",
      "A super PAC backed by conservative donor and shipping executive Richard Uihlein also has given to groups involved in state Supreme Court races in Montana and Ohio.",
      "Progressive groups are even focusing attention on longshot states such as Texas, where Republicans hold all the seats on the Supreme Court. They're trying to unseat three GOP justices who were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state's abortion ban.",
      "One group, Find Out PAC, has been running digital ads in San Antonio, Dallas and Houston criticizing justices Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland. In its ad, the group accuses the three of \u201cplaying doctor from the bench.\u201d",
      "In North Carolina, Riggs' campaigning on abortion rights has prompted complaints from Republicans who say she's stepping outside the bounds of judicial ethics. But Riggs said she's not saying how she would rule in any case and is merely sharing her values with voters.",
      "\u201cI'm going to keep talking about my values because, at the core, our democracy works best when people cast informed votes,\u201d she said.",

      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and a Native American tribe are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d"

      "About a dozen cars await servicing in the shop as a dog Hooks adopted the day before barks in its new cage. Exercise equipment, motorcycles and power tools abut the kitchen on the side of the renovated building where his wife cooks a meal. At 6 feet, 2 inches, and with a sturdy build, Hooks has a graying beard and a head of curls he says could be laced with snow flurries by this time of year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got to be one of the only Black businesses on this street,\u201d he says, noting that his repair shop stands on Peach Street, one of the city's main traffic arteries. He appreciates the greetings from passersby. But he says many people who know him from the neighborhoods where he grew up will never step foot in the shop. Almost all his customers are white.",
      "Hooks, 58, is a member of a coveted demographic in this year's election \u2014 a Black man and a business owner in a swing state. Both presidential campaigns have targeted Black entrepreneurs with their messaging, offering a range of economic policies and legislation that each side says will boost the careers and lives of African Americans.",
      "How Erie business owners and voters such as Hooks view each candidate's economic vision could determine control of the White House. Erie County has gone for the candidate who won Pennsylvania in every presidential election since 1992. Both Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris have visited the city of 94,000 in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cErie is a pivot point,\u201d said Rhonda Matthews, co-founder of Erie Black Wall Street, a business group that supports local Black entrepreneurs. From population rates to business startups, the future of Erie's economy and politics have shown where the country may be heading. \u201cI think if you want to know about what's happening economically writ large in the country, you can look and see what's happening in Erie.\"",
      "Harris has rolled out a series of economic proposals meant to tackle affordability and boost small businesses. Trump has stressed his promise of sweeping tariffs, new corporate tax cuts and an unprecedented crackdown on illegal and legal immigration to the country.",
      "Local leaders are weighing the impact of each agenda on their plans to renew the Rust Belt.",
      "\u201cA lack of predictability would be the worst possible thing,\u201d said Drew Whiting, CEO of the Erie Downtown Development Corporation, which is directing more than $100 million in private investment to the downtown area.",
      "Whiting praised federal policies such as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are meant to spur economic development in low-income communities and were created as part of the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul, as well as the investments in Erie enabled by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law spearheaded by Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "But Whiting added that \u201cbroad brush\u201d policies such as Trump\u2019s proposed 20% tariffs on all foreign goods threatened to be \u201can inflation bomb that would crush small businesses\u201d like those he works with. Whiting viewed Harris\u2019 proposed investments for small businesses to be a potential boon. A no tax on tips policy, which both Harris and Trump favor, would be a welcome innovation for workers, he said.",
      "The Harris campaign has zeroed in on affordability as a key concern of voters amid rising inflation. Her proposals to punish companies that gouge prices and her promises to expand support for health care and child care are issues where the campaign believes they can lower costs for working families. Trump, by contrast, would lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, extend his tax cuts and further cut other individual and family taxes, including by eliminating taxes on Social Security.",
      "Most mainstream economists agree that Trump\u2019s proposals would worsen inflation.",
      "Local business owners who spoke with The Associated Press expressed cautious optimism about Harris\u2019 proposals to support small businesses, though most were largely skeptical about the impact that federal policy could have on their lives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so many factors, things to consider from right here and global factors,\u201d said Gus Paliouras, owner of New York Lunch, a local diner. Paliouras\u2019 family immigrated to the United States from Greece and bought the diner in 1970, when it was one of dozens of bustling businesses on top of a post office, school and church. Now Paliouras\u2019 diner is the only storefront left on the block.",
      "\u201cI try to keep it like Geneva in here,\u201d he said, referring to the city in famously neutral Switzerland. \u201cIn this town, we could have Trump, Kamala and Kennedy supporters sitting right next to each other at the bar.\u201d Independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was in the race until August, when he suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump.",
      "Hooks considers himself a survivor.",
      "Born and raised in Erie, Hooks grew up in poverty and with few options, support or direction for his life. At 23, he was sentenced to 30 years for dealing marijuana. He served eight years in prison, an experience he described as \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d",
      "Prison was the first place Hooks was exposed to scripture \u2014 the Bible and Quran \u2014 as well as stories about travel, business and history.",
      "While he has transformed his circumstances and overcome \u201ctrials and tribulations that made me a better man,\u201d he finds the distinctions that some draw between poor, working and middle-class people to be meaningless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because we have people in this country that want to be better than someone else,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cYou drive a Toyota Camry, I drive the Lexus. It\u2019s the same ... car. It\u2019s just a different name, but it\u2019s a higher status.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor example, (Harris) says she wants to give us a $50,000 tax break or whatever,\u201d he added, referring to the vice president\u2019s proposed tax credit for new small businesses. \u201cBut that could never come into fruition with people that think they better than somebody, but you live next door to me, and your sign says Trump.\u201d",
      "In addition to his car care company, Hooks now runs a food catering business. On the weekends he goes back to the neighborhoods where he grew up to feed, clothe and cut hair for kids for free. His charity efforts are focused on making sure children never have the experiences he once faced.",
      "Hooks is skeptical of the ability of politicians to change fundamental problems facing everyday Americans, but says he\u2019ll be voting for Harris.",
      "\u201cTrump had the opportunity to be great,\u201d Hooks said, but called Trump's first term a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Hooks said he preferred \u201cgoing with someone who may at least try and help the little guy.\u201d"

      "The man, 61, was surfing off Waiehu Beach Park Friday morning when a shark bit him. Police officers who arrived to the scene first tried to control the bleeding with tourniquets. His right leg was \u201ccompletely severed just below the knee,\u201d Maui County said in a news release.",
      "The man was alert while being treated on shore and then taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center in critical condition.",
      "The man said he did not see the shark approach, authorities reported.",
      "The incident prompted officials to close the beach park. Officials warned people to stay out of the water in the area. The public warning to stay out of the water for a mile in each direction of the incident will be in effect until at least noon Saturday. The warning will be extended if there is a shark sighting in the area.",
      "Maui fire and ocean safety officials were patrolling the waters using rescue watercraft and a drone. State officials provided shark warning signs and helped with cordoning off the area.",
      "There were no details provided on what kind of shark was involved.",
      "In June, well-known surfer Tamayo Perry was killed in a shark attack while surfing off Oahu's North Shore.",

      "WEST STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. -- This year's Rockefeller Center Christmas tree comes with a strong New England accent, and locals could not be more excited.",
      "The Norway spruce that will travel to New York City hails from West Stockbridge, Massachusetts. It was scheduled to be cut down Thursday and make the roughly 140-mile (225-kilometer) journey south, arriving Nov. 9 in midtown Manhattan.",
      "The tree will be lit during a live TV broadcast on Dec. 4, featuring 50,000 multi-colored lights with a Swarovski star on top and remain on display until mid-January.",
      "Local residents were flocking to the tree this week, which was planted 67 years ago in honor of the homeowner's nieces and several workers could be seen high up in the 11-ton (9.97-metric ton) tree, tying up its branches for a trip down south.",
      "It is the first Rockefeller Center Christmas tree to come from Massachusetts since 1959.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people coming to town that are interested in this. So people are at the house taking pictures and excited about it,\u201d said Bernie Fallon, a resident of West Stockbridge, a town of 1,400 in western Massachusetts. \u201cThe talk of the town, local gossip and conversation is quite high.\u201d",

      "The 2024 presidential contest speeds into its final weekend with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a razor-thin contest",
      "NEW YORK -- The 2024 presidential contest speeds into its final weekend with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a razor-thin contest.",
      "At this late stage in the campaign, every day matters. And while few voters might change their minds this late in a typical election, there is a sense that what happens in these final days could shift votes.",
      "Harris and Trump are crisscrossing the country to rally voters in the states that matter most. They're trying \u2014 with varying degrees of success \u2014 to stay focused on a clear and concise closing message. At the same time, each side is investing massive resources to drive up turnout for the final early voting period. And in these critical days, the flow of misinformation is intensifying.",
      "Here's what we're watching on the final weekend before Election Day, which is Tuesday:",
      "You only need to look at the candidates' schedules this weekend to know where this election will likely be decided.",
      "Note that schedules can and likely will change without warning. But on Saturday, Trump began with an appearance in North Carolina, with one eyebrow-raising stop in Virginia next, and planned to return to the Tar Heel state in the evening.",
      "No Democratic presidential candidate has carried North Carolina since Barack Obama in 2008, although it has been decided by less than 3 points in every election since. Trump's decision to spend Saturday there suggests Harris has a real opportunity in the state. But Trump is also trying to convey confidence by stopping in Virginia, a state that has been safely in the Democratic column since 2008.",
      "There is perhaps no more important swing state than Pennsylvania, where Trump is expected to campaign Sunday. But he also has another appearance scheduled for North Carolina in addition to Georgia, another Southern state that has leaned Republican for almost three decades \u2014 that is, until Joe Biden carried it by less than a half percentage point four years ago.",
      "Harris campaigned in Atlanta on Saturday before a rally in North Carolina's capital \u2014 signs that her team is sensing genuine opportunity in the South. She\u2019s planning to make multiple stops in Michigan on Sunday, shifting to a Democratic-leaning state in the \u201cblue wall\u201d where her allies believe she is vulnerable.",
      "Trump's campaign leadership wants voters to be focused on one key question as they prepare to cast ballots, and it's the same question he opens every rally with: Are you better off today than you were four years ago?",
      "Harris' team wants voters to be thinking about another: Do they trust Trump or Harris to put the nation's interests over their own?",
      "Whichever candidate can more effectively keep voters focused on their closing arguments in the coming days may ultimately win the presidency. Yet both candidates are off to a challenging start.",
      "Trump opens the weekend still facing the fallout from his recent New York City rally in which a comedian described Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating pile of garbage.\u201d Things got harder for Trump late Thursday after he raised the prospect of Republican rival Liz Cheney's death by gunfire.",
      "It was exactly the kind of inflammatory comment his allies want him to avoid at this critical moment.",
      "Harris' campaign, meanwhile, is still working to shift the conversation away from President Biden's comments earlier in the week that described Trump supporters as \u201cgarbage.\u201d The Associated Press reported late Thursday that White House press officials altered the official transcript of the call in question, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity.",
      "The spotlight of presidential politics always burns brightly. But it will burn brightest, perhaps, this final weekend, leaving the campaigns virtually no margin for error. In what both sides believe is a true tossup election, any final-hours missteps could prove decisive.",
      "Trump's graphic attack against Cheney was especially troublesome given his allies' heightened concerns about women voters.",
      "Polling shows a significant gender gap in the contest with Harris generally having a much better rating among women than Trump has. Part of that may be the result of the GOP's fight to restrict abortion rights, which has been disastrous for Trump's party. But Trump's divisive leadership has also pushed women away.",
      "Going into the weekend, Trump allies, including conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk, are warning that far more women than men appear to be casting early ballots. While it's impossible to know whom they're voting for, Kirk clearly believes that's bad news for Trump.",
      "Trump isn't helping his cause. A day before his violent rhetoric about Cheney, the former president made waves by insisting that he would protect women whether they \u201clike it or not.\u201d",
      "Harris, who would be the nation's first female president, said Trump doesn't understand women\u2019s rights \u201cto make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether the Democrat's argument can break through on this packed weekend. But Harris\u2019 team believes there's still a significant chunk of persuadable voters out there. And they say the undecideds are disproportionately Republican-leaning suburban women.",
      "More than 66 million people have already cast ballots in the 2024 election, which is more than one-third the total number who voted in 2020.",
      "They include significantly more Republicans compared with four years ago, largely because Trump has backed off his insistence that his supporters must cast ballots in person on Election Day.",
      "And while early in-person voting has ended in many states, there will be a huge push for final-hours early voting in at least three key states as the campaigns work to bank as many votes as possible before Election Day.",
      "That includes Michigan, where in-person early voting runs through Monday. Voters in Wisconsin can vote early in-person through Sunday, although it varies by location. And in North Carolina, voters have until 3 p.m. Saturday to cast early ballots in-person.",
      "The early voting period officially ended Friday in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania.",
      "Meanwhile, questions remain about the Trump campaign\u2019s get-out-the-vote operation, which is relying heavily on well-funded outside groups with little experience \u2014 including one group funded largely by billionaire Elon Musk that\u2019s facing new questions about its practices.",
      "Harris\u2019 campaign, by contrast, is running a more traditional get-out-the-vote operation that features more than 2,500 paid staffers and 357 offices in battleground states alone.",
      "Trump's allies appear to be intensifying baseless claims about voter fraud, and some are being amplified by Trump himself. He has spent months sowing doubts about the integrity of the 2024 election in the event he loses \u2014 just as he did four years ago.",
      "His unfounded accusations are becoming more specific, in some cases, as wild claims begin to show up on social media.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump claimed on social media that York County, Pennsylvania had \u201creceived THOUSANDS of potentially FRAUDULENT Voter Registration Forms and Mail-In Ballot Applications from a third party group.\u201d He has also pointed to Lancaster County, which he claimed had been \u201ccaught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person. Really bad \u201cstuff.\u201d\u201d",
      "Trump was referring to investigations into potential fraud related to voter registration applications. The discovery and investigation into the applications provide evidence the system is working as it should.",
      "The Republican nominee has also raised baseless claims about overseas ballots and noncitizens voting, and suggested without evidence that Harris might have access to some kind of secret inside information about election results.",
      "Expect such claims to surge, especially on social media, in the coming days. And remember that a broad coalition of top government and industry officials, many of them Republicans, found that the 2020 election was the \u201cmost secure\u201d in American history.\"",

      "GASTONIA, N.C. -- GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump will rally supporters in North Carolina every day until Tuesday's election, a flurry of late activity in the only swing state that he won in both his 2016 and 2020 campaigns.",
      "Even as Trump looks to expand the electoral map and project strength with trips to New Mexico and Virginia, two Democratic states not widely viewed as competitive, he is putting considerable time into North Carolina, which last backed a Democrat for president in 2008.",
      "The former president's path to the 270 electoral votes needed to capture the presidency gets significantly more complicated if he loses North Carolina. The fast-growing Southern state gave Trump his smallest margin of victory \u2014 1.3 percentage points \u2014 over Democrat Joe Biden four years ago.",
      "Trump campaigned in Gastonia, west of Charlotte, and Greensboro on Saturday, with a stop in Salem, Virginia, in between. He will be in the eastern city of Kinston on Sunday and in Raleigh on Monday. Those four rallies will bring his total events in North Carolina since Oct. 1 to nine. His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has been in the state six times during the same period, most recently on Friday.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, also was in North Carolina on Saturday for a concert and rally in Charlotte. Her campaign has not announced any other travel to the state before Election Day, though she's sending her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, to Greenville on Monday.",
      "The extensive damage from Hurricane Helene across western North Carolina has created a dose of uncertainty about the state of play here. Flooding destroyed homes and displaced residents in several counties, including the liberal city of Asheville and the conservative rural areas surrounding it.",
      "Trump's team has said it is confident about his chances in North Carolina. Democrats see Trump's attention on the state as a signal of optimism for Harris.",
      "\u201cThe repeat appearances may signal Trump\u2019s campaign is in trouble,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Marcia Morey of Durham. \u201cIf Trump continues with his dangerous, violent rhetoric these last few days, it may backfire. A campaign of personal retribution does not win votes from people.\u201d",
      "Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump's late-campaign travels are not a signal of alarm.",
      "\u201cI'm not worried about anything,\" Miller told reporters Friday. \"We have a smart strategy that's going to get President Trump across 270, maybe even a couple of states that surprise you, that slide in there. But we\u2019re going to follow our strategy. Our strategy comes from our data and our targeting.\u201d",
      "As he does at most of his events in North Carolina, Trump said in Gastonia that his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, whom he installed as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, is from the state, and that Lara and Eric Trump named their daughter Carolina.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing place. You\u2019ve been through a lot,\u201d Trump said, alluding to the hurricane before repeating a debunked claim that the Federal Emergency Management Agency prioritized people living in the country illegally over hurricane victims. \u201cYour government has not helped you too much, I can tell you. Your government, FEMA, has let you down because they wanted to spend the money on illegal migrants instead.\u201d",
      "Later in Greensboro, only about half of the seats were filled in a massive 22,000-seat arena when Trump started speaking after 9 p.m. Trump spoke at another arena that\u2019s part of the same complex just 11 days earlier, though Harris filled the larger venue when she spoke there recently.",
      "Roughly half of North Carolina's 7.8 million registered voters had already voted as of Friday, buoyed by early in-person voting, which ended on Saturday afternoon.",
      "North Carolina Republicans have been encouraged by early voter turnout among their supporters after national and state GOP leaders switched this year to a \u201cbank your vote\u201d strategy, rather than focusing on Election Day turnout.",
      "Entering the final days of the campaign, over 50,000 more GOP registered voters than Democrats had voted early or by absentee ballot, even though there are over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans statewide, according to state elections data. It is unclear whether the Republicans' early vote surge will result in a higher overall turnout for Trump supporters.",
      "Independent voters now make up the largest group of registered voters in North Carolina. Trump lost ground with independents between 2016 and 2020.",
      "Harris took the stage in Charlotte after rocker Jon Bon Jovi warmed up the crowd, sticking closely to the speech she's been delivering in her final tour of the battleground states.",
      "Harris supporter Gwen Garnett, 66, said Trump barnstorming North Carolina is \u201cjust part of the process. It does not worry me at all.\u201d She gave Harris\u2019 candidacy a spiritual dimension.",
      "\u201cThis is an anointed time for her to be in this role,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cI just believe it\u2019s God\u2019s timing.\u201d",
      "The state\u2019s voters have shown a propensity to split their ticket over the years. That's why while Republicans have controlled the state legislature since 2011, Democrats have held the governor\u2019s mansion for all but four years since 1993.",
      "The GOP's hopes to break that hold on Tuesday appeared to dwindle in recent weeks after the party\u2019s nominee for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, received unwanted publicity from a CNN report that alleged he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website\u2019s message board more than a decade ago.",
      "While Robinson denied writing the messages and sued CNN for defamation last month, his campaign nearly imploded, raising fears that a large victory by Democrat Josh Stein, the state's attorney general, could harm GOP candidates in other races.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina had already surpassed its early-voting record set in 2020, but the State Board of Elections announced Sunday that more than 4.2 million voters cast ballots at early in-person voting sites, with turnout in western counties hit by Hurricane Helene outpacing the rest of the state.",
      "Early in-person voting, which ended Saturday, has become increasingly popular in the presidential battleground state over several election cycles. People can simultaneously register to vote and cast ballots at early voting sites.",
      "Four years ago, a record 3.63 million people voted at hundreds of sites in all 100 counties during the early-voting period. This year, the state exceeded that total by Thursday, days before the period ended, the board said.",
      "Including absentee voting, 4,465,548 voters \u2014 or 57% of the state\u2019s 7.8 million registered voters \u2014 cast ballots in the general election as of Sunday morning, officials said, noting that turnout may be slightly higher because of a lag between when ballots are cast and when data is uploaded.",
      "Turnout in the 25 western counties affected by Hurricane Helene was stronger than the rest of the state at 58.9% \u2014 about 2% higher than statewide turnout, officials said.",
      "\u201cI am proud of all of our 100 county boards of elections and the thousands of election workers who are making this happen in their communities,\u201d state board Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell said in a statement. \u201cAnd I am especially proud of the workers and voters of Western North Carolina. You are an inspiration to us all.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s strong early turnout has come partly in response to a push by state and national Republicans to get people to vote early. Their message marks a sharp contrast to the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump \u2014 without any evidence to back the claim \u2014 said mail-in voting was rife with fraud.",
      "In addition to president, North Carolina residents are choosing a new governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions, along with members of the U.S. House and state General Assembly."

      "Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s assort...",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Warren Buffett is now sitting on more than $325 billion cash after continuing to unload billions of dollars worth of Apple and Bank of America shares this year and continuing to collect a steady stream of profits from all of Berkshire Hathaway's assorted businesses without finding any major acquisitions.",
      "Berkshire said it sold off about 100 million more Apple shares in the third quarter after halving its massive investment in the iPhone maker last quarter. The remaining stake of roughly 300 million shares was valued at $69.9 billion at the end of September remains Berkshire's biggest single investment, but it has been cut drastically since the end of last year when it was worth $174.3 billion.",
      "Investors will also be disappointed to learn that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own shares in the quarter.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said shareholders will wonder why Buffett is continuing to accumulate so much cash. \u201cAre they more pessimistic about the future economic and market picture than perhaps others are?\u201d she said.",
      "Buffett said at the annual meeting in May that part of why he started selling some of his Apple shares is that he expects tax rates to go higher in the future. But Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said he wonders if part of the reason Buffett started selling Apple is tied to last year's death of Vice Chairman Charlie Munger because the sales started shortly after Munger's death. Shanahan said Buffett has never been as comfortable with technology businesses as his longtime partner was.",
      "\u201cIf Charlie Munger were still alive, perhaps he wouldn\u2019t have sold down the position quite as aggressively \u2014 maybe at all,\u201d Shanahan said.",
      "Berkshire said Saturday that investment gains again drove its third quarter profits skyward to $26.25 billion, or $18,272 per Class A share. A year ago, unrealized paper investment losses dragged the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's earnings down to a loss of $12.77 billion, or $8,824 per Class A share.",
      "Buffett has long recommended that investors pay more attention to Berkshire\u2019s operating earnings if they want to get a good sense of how the businesses it owns are doing because those numbers exclude investments. Berkshire\u2019s bottom-line profit figures can vary widely from quarter to quarter along with the value of its investments regardless of whether the company bought or sold anything.",
      "By that measure, Berkshire said its operating earnings were only down about 6% at $10.09 billion, or $7,023.01 per Class A share. That compares to last year's $10.8 billion, or $7,437.15 per Class A share.",
      "The four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted that Berkshire would report operating earnings of $7,335.11 per Class A share.",
      "Berkshire's revenue didn't change much at $92.995 billion. A year ago, it reported $93.21 billion revenue. That number was ahead of the $92.231 billion revenue that three analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted.",
      "Berkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses, including Geico, along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See\u2019s Candy.",
      "One of Berkshire's insurers, Guard, reported some additional losses on previous years after managers reassessed its policies.",
      "Berkshire did resolve one mystery from the quarter by spelling out how much it paid to acquire the rest of the shares in its utility business from the estate of former Berkshire board member Walter Scott.",
      "Berkshire said it paid $2.4 billion cash, issued $600 million in debt and gave the Scott family Class B Berkshire shares worth a little over $1 billion. So the total compensation was about $4 billion. That means the Scott family didn\u2019t get nearly as good of a price for their 8% stake in the utilities as when Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel sold his 1% stake in the utility business two years ago for $870 million.",
      "Abel is slated to succeed the 94-year-old Buffett as CEO in the event of his death."

      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a slimmed-down version earlier this year",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has approved a revised plan for a massive proposed wind farm after he rejected a sharply slimmed-down version earlier this year.",
      "Inslee urged permitting officials to work quickly to allow the construction of as many Horse Heaven Wind Farm turbines as possible, The Seattle Times reported. Washington state won't meet its \u201curgent clean energy needs\u201d if officials take years to authorize the turbines, he said.",
      "The original $1.7 billion project included up to 222 wind turbines across 24 miles (38.6 kilometers) of hillsides in the Tri-Cities area of eastern Washington and three solar arrays covering up to 8.5 square miles (22 square kilometers).",
      "But then Washington\u2019s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, a clearinghouse for permits required by large projects, recommended slashing the proposal in half because nests of the endangered ferruginous hawk were found in the area. It wanted a 2-mile (3.2-kilometer) buffer around each nest.",
      "Most nests were empty, but the hawks can return to them years later.",
      "In May, Inslee rejected the council's recommendation to shrink the project, prompting the panel to suggest a compromise that would examine turbines and nests on a case-by-case basis. Under this plan, which Inslee formally approved Oct. 18, a technical advisory group would recommend whether to reduce individual nest setbacks to 1 kilometer (0.6 mile.)",
      "This could allow the developer, Boulder, Colorado-based Scout Clean Energy, to build all but 30 of the turbines originally proposed.",
      "Inslee, a Democrat, has sought to make climate initiatives key to his legacy. He is not seeking reelection after three terms in office.",
      "The wind farm project has pitted local opponents against the state\u2019s ever-growing need for renewable energy since it was first proposed in 2021. In a letter to the site evaluation council, Inslee noted that Washington\u2019s energy demands could nearly double by 2050."

      "The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings",
      "DELPHI, Ind. -- The trial of a man accused of killing two teenage girls in a small Indiana community has passed its midway point following more than two weeks of testimony about the 2017 killings.",
      "Prosecutors rested their case Thursday against Richard Allen after jurors heard recorded phone calls in which he told his wife that he killed Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14.",
      "Allen's trial began Oct. 18 at the Carroll County Courthouse in Delphi, the girls\u2019 hometown. Jurors have been sequestered since the begining of the trial, which is scheduled to run through Nov. 15.",
      "The defense began calling its first witnesses Thursday. A psychologist for the Indiana Department of Correction told jurors Friday that Allen was seriously mentally ill when he began confessing to the killings while housed at the Westville Correctional Facility.",
      "Allen, 52, faces up to 130 years in prison if he is convicted on two counts of murder and two additional counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit kidnapping.",
      "Here are some key moments in the trial so far:",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland opened the trial by telling jurors they would see and hear evidence, including incriminating statements Allen has made, that will convince them he forced the girls off a hiking trail into a secluded area while armed with a gun and cut their throats.",
      "Allen was the person seen on cellphone video German recorded on the day the girls disappeared and an unspent bullet found between their bodies came from Allen's gun, McLeland said.",
      "Defense attorney Andrew Baldwin told jurors Allen is innocent. Baldwin said the jury would hear witness statements and forensic evidence that would raise \u201creasonable doubt\u201d that Allen is not the killer and said the state's timeline does not match the evidence in the case.",
      "Someone else may have kidnapped the teens and returned them early the next day to the scene where they were found dead, Baldwin said.",
      "In the first full week of the trial, jurors were shown photographs of the area where the teens' bodies were found in a wooded area off the hiking trail. The girls, known as Abby and Libby, had crossed an abandoned railroad trestle called the Monon High Bridge during their hike.",
      "Some jurors and others in the courtroom gasped or turned away when gruesome images of their bloody bodies were shown, and the girls' mothers wept.",
      "Jurors also viewed cellphone video that German recorded just before the youths vanished showing a man wearing a blue jacket and jeans following Williams as she crosses the Monon High Bridge.",
      "In an enhanced version of the video shown to jurors, one of the girls says, \u201cThere\u2019s no path so we have to go down here.\u201d Just before the video ends, prosecutors said, the man seen in the video tells the teens, \u201c Down the hill.\u201d",
      "Investigators said in an affidavit released about a month after Allen's October 2022 arrest that he became a suspect after they went back and reviewed \u201cprior tips\u201d and found that he had been interviewed by an officer in 2017.",
      "Trial testimony has revealed more details about how they zeroed in on the former pharmacy worker.",
      "A retired state government worker who volunteered in March 2017 to help police with the investigation told jurors that in September 2022 she found paperwork that caught her eye.",
      "Kathy Shank testified she found a \u201clead sheet\u201d saying that two days after German and Williams\u2019 bodies were found, a man contacted authorities and said he had been on the trail the afternoon the girls went missing. His name was listed incorrectly as Richard Allen Whiteman and marked \u201ccleared,\u201d Shank said.",
      "She determined the man\u2019s name was actually Richard Allen and recalled that a young girl had been on the trail at the same location and time and had seen a man.",
      "\u201cI thought there could be a correlation,\u201d Shank testified, adding that she notified officers of her find.",
      "The girls' bodies were found Feb. 14, 2017, the day after they went missing.",
      "Two days later, Allen contacted authorities and told them he was on the hiking trail the afternoon of Feb. 13, during the time period when the girls disappeared, according to testimony.",
      "Dan Dulin, an Indiana Department of Natural Resources captain, told the court he spoke to Allen, who said he was on the hiking trail between 1 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. and remembered seeing three girls.",
      "After Shank brought Allen to investigators\u2019 attention, they interviewed him in October 2022. Allen told investigators he arrived at the trail around noon and left no later than 2 p.m., not 3:30 p.m. as he told Dulin in 2017.",
      "Steve Mullin, who was Delphi's police chief when the girls were killed and later became an investigator at the county prosecutor\u2019s office, said Allen told him and another officer that he was wearing a blue or black Carhartt jacket, jeans and a beanie on the day the teens vanished.",
      "Mullin said he asked Allen if he was the similarly dressed person seen in German\u2019s cellphone video.",
      "\u201cHis response was if the picture was taken with the girls\u2019 camera, there was no way it was him,\u201d Mullin testified.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors police interviews with Allen videotaped before his arrest in which he repeatedly professed his innocence.",
      "On Thursday the jury heard several recorded phone calls of Allen speaking with his wife from prison in which he told her that he killed German and Williams. In one of the calls, he said, \u201cI did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\u201d",
      "The jury heard testimony earlier from the former warden of the Westville Correctional Facility, where Allen was previously held, who said Allen claimed to have killed the girls with a box cutter that he later discarded.",
      "Dr. Monica Wala, Allen\u2019s prison psychologist during his time at Westville, testified Allen began confessing to killing the girls in early 2023 during his sessions with her. She said he provided details of the crime in some of the confessions, including telling her he slashed the girls\u2019 throats and put tree branches over their bodies.",
      "A report written by Wala and presented to the jury as an exhibit states Allen also told her he had planned to rape the teens but did not do so after he saw a van traveling nearby.",
      "A state trooper testified Thursday that Allen's remark corroborated a statement by a man whose driveway passes under the Monon High Bridge and who said he was driving home in his van around that time.",
      "Allen's attorneys have said their client made the incriminating statements while under the pressure and mental stress of being locked up and watched 24 hours a day and being taunted by people incarcerated with him.",
      "During cross-examination, Wala acknowledged she followed Allen\u2019s case with interest during her personal time even while she was treating him and that she was a fan of the true crime genre.",
      "Court documents released weeks after Allen\u2019s arrest state that testing determined an unspent bullet found between the girls' bodies \u201chad been cycled through\u201d a pistol Allen owned.",
      "Melissa Oberg, an Indiana State Police firearms expert, told the jury her analysis tied the round to Allen\u2019s Sig Sauer, a .40-caliber handgun.",
      "Allen\u2019s attorney tried to cast doubt on the accuracy of firearms testing during cross-examination. Oberg said she is not aware of making any identification mistakes in her more than 17 years of analyzing firearms."

      "Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes",
      "BOSTON -- Firefighters in Massachusetts are continuing to battle stubborn brush fires across the state with officials urging residents to take precautions to help avoid sparking new blazes.",
      "Hundreds of acres (hectares) in the greater Boston area have already burned in the past week with new fires cropping up in the western and central parts of the state.",
      "In Massachusetts, an average of 15 wildland fires are reported each October. This year, the month\u2019s total capped at about 200 \u2014 an increase of about 1,200% over the average, rivalling the monthly numbers usually seen in the traditional early spring brush fire season.",
      "About 100 fire were reported over the last seven days of the month and preliminary information indicates that all of them started with human activity, according to fire officials. The fires prompted some communities last week to cancel school classes and Halloween activities.",
      "On Friday, the National Weather Service declared a \u201cred flag\u201d warning for much of eastern Massachusetts. The warning means that the region, which has been experiencing dry and warm weather, is at high risk of fire.",
      "Fire officials have reminded residents that open burning is prohibited statewide through January and in many communities year-round.",
      "They also urged residents to avoid outdoor cooking and heating and to use caution when using power equipment like lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The engines can become hot enough to ignite dry leaves and grass.",
      "Fire officials also cautioned against tossing cigarette butts, matches, or other smoking materials over the edge of a balcony, stub them out on stairs or railings, or toss them in dry vegetation or debris.",
      "On Saturday, a Boston man was arrested in connection to a brush fire in Milford, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. The man was charged with setting fire to another\u2019s land and burning land, trees, lumber and produce.",
      "More than a quarter of this year's brush and wildland fires took place in October, according to Chief Fire Warden David Celino of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. The October fires have also accounted for more than half of the 1,158 acres (469 hectares) burned so far this year.",
      "\u201cThe weather conditions and dry surface fuels that have contributed to these fast-moving fires are expected to continue in the days ahead,\" Celino said in a press release. \"Any outdoor fire will grow quickly, become difficult to control, and require numerous firefighting resources.\u201d",
      "State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said about 45% of Massachusetts homes are in or near wooded areas at risk for brush and wildland fires. Many of those fires have started with activity around the house, like outdoor cooking and using lawn tractors and other power equipment, he added.",

      "U.N. experts say Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels have been transformed from a local armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization with support from Iran, Iraqi armed groups, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militants and others, U.N. experts said in a new report.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have exploited the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and worked to enhance their status in Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d to gain popularity in the region and beyond, the experts monitoring sanctions against the Houthis said in the 537-page report to the U.N. Security Council.",
      "To support Iranian-backed Hamas militants, whose surprise attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparked the war in Gaza, the Houthis have been attacking vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, disrupting global shipping in a key geopolitical area.",
      "Despite Houthi claims that they would target ships linked to Israel, the panel said its investigations revealed the rebels have been targeting vessels indiscriminately.",
      "Its analysis of data from the International Maritime Organization, the U.S. and the United Kingdom revealed that at least 134 attacks were carried out from Houthi-controlled areas against merchant and commercial vessels and U.S. and U.K. warships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden between Nov. 15, 2023, and July 31, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe group\u2019s shift to actions at sea increased their influence in the region,\u201d the U.N. experts said. \u201cSuch a scale of attacks, using weapon systems on civilian vessels, had never occurred since the Second World War.\u201d",
      "In their attacks, the experts said, the Houthis used a new and previously undisclosed ballistic missile, the Hatem-2.",
      "The five-member U.N. panel includes experts on arms, finance, regional affairs, international humanitarian law and armed groups. The experts hail from India, Egypt, Switzerland, Belgium and Cabo Verde. Confidential sources told the panel that the Houthis are coordinating operations with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and strengthening ties to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group in Somalia.",
      "The Houthis have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of the capital Sanaa and most of the north. Hopes for peace talks to end the war vanished after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",
      "The U.N. experts said the Yemen conflict, which started as an internal fight and expanded into a regional confrontation, \u201chas now escalated into a major international crisis.\u201d",
      "According to the experts, the number of Houthi fighters is estimated at 350,000 now, compared with 220,000 in 2022 and 30,000 in 2015.",
      "\u201cThe panel observes the transformation of the Houthis from a localized armed group with limited capabilities to a powerful military organization, extending their operational capabilities well beyond the territories under their control,\u201d the report said.",
      "The experts said the transformation has been possible due to the transfer of military materiel and training provided by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard\u2019s elite Quds Force, Hezbollah and Iraqi specialists and technicians.",
      "Military experts, Yemeni officials and even officials close to the Houthis indicated that the rebel group couldn\u2019t produce complex weapons systems such as ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, surveillance and attack drones, portable air defense systems, and thermal sights, which they have used without foreign support, the U.N. experts said.",
      "\u201cThe scale, nature and extent of transfers of diverse military materiel and technology provided to the Houthis from external sources, including financial support and training of its combatants, is unprecedented,\u201d the experts said.",
      "The panel said it observed similarities between multiple military items used by the Houthis and those produced and operated by Iran or its allies in the Axis of Resistance, which includes Hezbollah and Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria.",
      "It said joint operations centers have been set up in Iraq and Lebanon with Houthi representatives \u201caimed at coordinating joint military actions of the Axis of Resistance.\u201d",
      "Inside Yemen, the panel said the Houthis have been intensifying military operations against the government. \u201cThe internal military situation is fragile, and any internal or external trigger could lead to the resumption of military confrontations,\u201d it said.",
      "The Houthis also have been recruiting large numbers of Yemeni youths and children as well as exploiting Ethiopian migrants, forcing them to join the fight against the government and engage in trafficking narcotics, it said.",
      "\u201cExploiting high illiteracy rates, particularly in tribal areas, they have reportedly mobilized boys as young as 10 or 11, often despite parental opposition,\u201d they said. \u201cRecruitment sermons and weekly classes on jihad are reportedly delivered in schools.\u201d",
      "Child recruitment reportedly increased after the war in Gaza started and the U.S. and U.K. airstrikes in Yemen, the experts said. Yemen\u2019s government said it received 3,298 reports of child recruitment in the first half of 2024, with youngsters reportedly used as human shields, spies and in combat \u2014 and for planting landmines and explosives, reconnaissance and as cooks."

    "story": [
      "The FBI is investigating the death of a Black man in Alabama who was found hanging in an abandoned house",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The FBI is investigating the death of a Black man in Alabama, who was found hanging in an abandoned house, following a request from a local sheriff amid fears among community members who accuse local law enforcement of longstanding, unchecked misconduct.",
      "Sheriff's deputies found Dennoriss Richardson, 39, in September in a rural part of Colbert County, miles away from his home in Sheffield, a city of approximately 10,000 people near the Tennessee River.",
      "The Colbert County Sheriff's Office ruled Richardson\u2019s death a suicide. But Richardson\u2019s wife, Leigh Richardson, has said that is not true, explaining her husband did not leave a note and had no connection to the house where he was found.",
      "Instead, the 40-year-old fears her husband\u2019s death was related to a lawsuit he filed against the local police department in February. Dennoriss Richardson, who coached kids in baseball and football, had alleged he was assaulted, denied medical attention, sprayed with tear gas and shocked with a Taser while in jail.",
      "Leigh Richardson said she is not accusing a specific person but is adamant her husband didn't kill himself.",
      "She is not alone in her belief. Widespread skepticism about Richardson\u2019s death underscores deep-seated distrust of local law enforcement in Colbert County. In a region where hanging invokes a long history of state-sanctioned lynchings for Black people, residents in the county allege a pattern of excessive force among local law enforcement.",
      "Sheriff Eric Balentine, who confirmed the FBI accepted his request to investigate, said his department \u201cexhausted all resources\u201d in its investigation.",
      "\u201cWe feel confident in what our findings were, but we feel like by doing this we can give the family more peace of mind,\u201d Balentine said.",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI's field office in Birmingham confirmed the FBI is aware of Dennoriss Richardson's death and is reviewing the allegations of criminal misconduct.",
      "Tori Bailey, the president of the local NAACP chapter and the only Black member of the six-person county commission in Colbert County, said the community\u2019s reaction to Richardson's death was partially informed by the region\u2019s harrowing history with lynchings.",
      "In Alabama, there were 359 reported lynchings between 1877 and 1943, according to the Equal Justice Initiative, a criminal justice reform nonprofit. In Colbert County alone, there were 11.",
      "Bailey said, although there may be nothing to these accusations, it makes sense the community would have a \u201cvisceral\u201d reaction to a Black man hanging and want a more thorough investigation. She said while some officers are trying to do the right thing, in her 12 years as NAACP president she has documented and investigated many cases of excessive force in the county.",
      "\u201cThere has long been a kind of disconnect between communities of color and law enforcement. Unfortunately, many of us do not feel that law enforcement is actually there to serve and protect,\u201d Bailey said.",
      "Marvin Long, a 57-year-old Black man and lifelong Colbert County resident, knew Dennoriss Richardson\u2019s family well growing up. He shares the skepticism about the suicide ruling and said Richardson\u2019s death has intensified his fear of retaliation.",
      "\u201cTo this day I hate seeing a police car,\u201d Long said. \u201cI\u2019m still more afraid now than ever.\u201d",
      "Long sued the Sheffield Police department last year. After he inquired about an unrelated arrest taking place just outside his property in 2021, body camera footage appears to show officers following Long to his house, dragging him down his porch steps and siccing the police K9 on him as he screams for help. Long was unarmed, according to the complaint.",
      "Richardson and Long are among five Black and Latino men represented by civil rights attorney Roderick Van Daniel who have filed lawsuits against the department in recent years.",
      "\u201cCitizens are living in fear of retaliation,\u201d Van Daniel said.",
      "In one case, an off-duty Sheffield police officer was caught on surveillance footage punching and pulling a gun on a Black man at a liquor store. The officer was later convicted of assault and menacing and reckless endangerment. He was fired from the department.",
      "In a separate lawsuit, a 57-year-old chiropractor claims he was shocked with a Taser 18 times while in handcuffs after he asked an officer to help him find his wife\u2019s iPhone. Photos included in the suit show several large burn marks allegedly from the assault.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not respond to numerous phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for the officers named in pending lawsuits did not respond to emails.",
      "Balentine, the sheriff since 2023, declined to comment on specific cases. But he said that based on his almost 30 years as an officer in the area, he thought residents in Colbert County generally trusted law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s proven that it was excessive, then I\u2019m sure that there will be accountability,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, Balentine said he hoped the FBI investigation would help assuage concerns.",
      "\u201cTransparency is always a good way to mend some fences with the community,\u201d he said.",
      "Leigh Richardson had known her husband since he was 17. She remembers Dennoriss, known affectionately as \u201cNa-Na,\u201d as a warm father to their five children. But she also said his fear of the police was not new.",
      "\u201cHe was scared at that young age,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "Richardson said that after filing the lawsuit her husband was frequently stopped by police. In those months, he was \u201ctrying to stay out of the way,\u201d she said.",
      "Sheffield Mayor Steve Stanley said Dennoriss Richardson had come to his office at least once to express concerns that he was being profiled. Stanley said he assured Richardson that any officers reported through official channels would be investigated.",
      "The Sheffield Police Department did not confirm whether or how frequently the department pulled over Richardson.",
      "Court records show Dennoriss Richardson had a long history of run-ins with local law enforcement, but the majority of the charges in federal and state courts did not stick.",
      "Dennoriss Richardson pleaded guilty to drug possession in 2006 and was sentenced to five years in prison. In more than 15 years since then, court records show Richardson was arrested at least six additional times by the Sheffield Police Department, for charges ranging from disorderly conduct to robbery to assault.",
      "None of those charges, except for a traffic violation for expired tags, resulted in a conviction, according to available court records.",
      "In the same week that Richardson filed his lawsuit against the department, he was charged with trafficking meth. He had been arrested in a house where drugs allegedly were found. Richardson was out on bond when he died.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:50:21 -0500",
    "summary": "No one knows how Tuesday&rsquo;s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
    "story": [
      "No one knows how Tuesday\u2019s presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve\u2019s move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- No one knows how Tuesday's presidential election will turn out, but the Federal Reserve's move two days later is much easier to predict: With inflation continuing to cool, the Fed is set to cut interest rates for a second time this year.",
      "The presidential contest might still be unresolved when the Fed ends its two-day meeting Thursday afternoon, yet that uncertainty would have no effect on its decision to further reduce its benchmark rate. The Fed's future actions, though, will become more unsettled once a new president and Congress take office in January, particularly if Donald Trump were to win the White House again.",
      "Trump's proposals to impose high tariffs on all imports and launch mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants and his threat to intrude on the Fed's normally independent rate decisions could send inflation surging, economists have said. Higher inflation would, in turn, compel the Fed to slow or stop its rate cuts.",
      "On Thursday, the Fed's policymakers, led by Chair Jerome Powell, are on track to cut their benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to about 4.6%, after having implemented a half-point reduction in September. Economists expect another quarter-point rate cut in December and possibly additional such moves next year. Over time, rate cuts tend to lower the costs of borrowing for consumers and businesses.",
      "The Fed is reducing its rate for a different reason than it usually does: It often cuts rates to boost a sluggish economy and a weak job market by encouraging more borrowing and spending. But the economy is growing briskly, and the unemployment rate is a low 4.1%, the government reported Friday, even with hurricanes and a strike at Boeing having sharply depressed net job growth last month.",
      "Instead, the central bank is lowering rates as part of what Powell has called \u201ca recalibration\u201d to a lower-inflation environment. When inflation spiked to a four-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, the Fed proceeded to raise rates 11 times \u2014 ultimately sending its key rate to about 5.3%, also the highest in four decades.",
      "But in September, year-over-year inflation dropped to 2.4%, barely above the Fed's 2% target and equal to its level in 2018. With inflation having fallen so far, Powell and other Fed officials have said they think high borrowing rates are no longer necessary. High borrowing rates typically restrict growth, particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as housing and auto sales.",
      "\u201cThe restriction was in place because inflation was elevated,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed economist. \u201cInflation is no longer elevated. The reason for the restriction is gone.\u201d",
      "Fed officials have suggested that their rate cuts would be gradual. But nearly all of them have expressed support for some further reductions.",
      "\u201cFor me, the central question is how much and how fast to reduce the target for the (Fed's key) rate, which I believe is currently set at a restrictive level,\u201d Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's Board of Directors, said in a speech last month.",
      "Jonathan Pingle, an economist at Swiss bank UBS, said that Waller's phrasing reflected \u201cunusual confidence and conviction that rates were headed lower.\"",
      "Next year, the Fed will likely start to wrestle with the question of just how low their benchmark rate should go. Eventually, they may want to set it at a level that neither restricts nor stimulates growth \u2014 \u201cneutral\u201d in Fed parlance.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials acknowledge that they don't know exactly where the neutral rate is. In September, the Fed's rate-setting committee estimated that it was 2.9%. Most economists think it's closer to 3% to 3.5%.",
      "The Fed chair said the officials have to assess where neutral is by how the economy responds to rate cuts. For now, most officials are confident that at 4.9%, the Fed's current rate is far above neutral.",
      "Some economists argue, though, that with the economy looking healthy even with high borrowing rates, the Fed doesn't need to ease credit much, if at all. The idea is that they may already be close to the level of interest rates that neither slows nor stimulates the economy.",
      "\u201cIf the unemployment rate stays in the low 4's and the economy is still going to grow at 3%, does it matter that the (Fed's) rate is 4.75% to 5%?\u201d said Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, asked. \u201cWhy are they cutting now?\u201d",
      "With the Fed's latest meeting coming right after Election Day, Powell will likely field questions at his news conference Thursday about the outcome of the presidential race and how it might affect the economy and inflation. He can be expected to reiterate that the Fed's decisions aren't affected by politics at all.",
      "During Trump's presidency, he imposed tariffs on washing machines, solar panels, steel and a range of goods from China, which President Joe Biden maintained. Though studies show that washing machine prices rose as a result, overall inflation did not rise much.",
      "But Trump is now proposing significantly broader tariffs \u2014 essentially, import taxes \u2014 that would raise the prices of about 10 times as many goods from overseas.",
      "Many mainstream economists are alarmed by Trump\u2019s latest proposed tariffs, which they say would almost certainly reignite inflation. A report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics concluded that Trump\u2019s main tariff proposals would make inflation 2 percentage points higher next year than it otherwise would have been.",
      "The Fed could be more likely to raise rates in response to tariffs this time, according to economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"given that Trump is threatening much bigger increases in tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAccordingly,\" they wrote, \u201cwe will scale back the reduction in the funds rate in our 2025 forecasts if Trump wins.\u201d",

      "Moldova's pro-EU president Maia Sandu appears on course for a second term after a pivotal presidential election run-off seen as a choice between Europe and Russia.",
      "Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was backed by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists and promised a closer relationship with Moscow, had taken an early lead.",
      "But with more than 90% of the vote counted, the Central Election Commission said Sandu had moved ahead with 51% of the vote, and with results still coming in from the expat vote she was expecting to cement her lead.",
      "During the vote, the president's national security adviser said there had been \"massive interference\" from Russia in Moldova's electoral process that had \"high potential to distort the outcome\".",
      "Russia had already denied meddling in the vote, which came a week after another key Eastern European election in Georgia, whose president said it had been a \"Russian special operation\".",
      "As polls closed, both Maia Sandu and her rival thanked voters, with Stoianoglu speaking in Russian as well as Romanian. Although Romanian is Moldova's main language, Russian is widely spoken because of its Soviet past.",
      "Alexandr Stoianoglo, who was fired as prosecutor general by Sandu, has denied being pro-Kremlin.",
      "Voting ended in Moldova at 21:00 (19:00 GMT), with a 54% turnout higher than four years ago, and especially high among expat voters at polling stations abroad.",
      "As Sandu took the lead, there was cheering at her campaign headquarters and chants of \"victory\".",
      "The result is likely to become even tighter as results from polling stations in the EU and the US become clear. The final result will be declared on Monday.",
      "Casting his ballot, he promised to be an \"apolitical president\" for everyone, telling reporters he had voted for \"a Moldova that should develop in harmony with both the West and the East\".",
      "Stoianoglu polled particularly well in rural areas and the south, while Sandu was ahead in the cities and abroad, Moldovan media reported.",
      "Sandu appealed after casting her ballot for Moldovans to preserve their independence, warning of \"thieves\" who sought to buy their vote and their country.",
      "Presidential national security adviser Stanislav Secrieru said Russia had organised buses and large charter flights to bring voters to polling stations.",
      "Bomb scares had briefly disrupted voting in Moldova, at UK polling stations in Liverpool and Northampton and at Frankfurt and Kaiserslautern in Germany, he added.",
      "A Soviet republic for 51 years, Moldova is flanked by Ukraine and Romania and one of Europe's poorest countries. It has a population of 2.5 million and an expat population of 1.2 million.",
      "Moldova's authorities have long warned that a fugitive oligarch called Ilan Shor has spent $39m (\u00a330m) trying to buy the election for Moscow with handouts to 138,000 Moldovans.",
      "Shor, who is based in Moscow, denies wrongdoing but did promise cash payments to anyone prepared to back his call for a \"firm No\" to the EU.",
      "Commentators and politicians had warned that a Stoianoglu victory could radically change the political landscape in the Danube and Black Sea region, not because he was some kind of \"Trojan horse\", but rather because Russia has thrown its weight behind him.",
      "There were queues at polling stations in Moscow, Italy and among voters from a mainly Russian-speaking breakaway region of Transnistria, who had to cross the River Dniester into Moldovan-controlled territory to vote. Transnistria is home to a Russian military base and a huge arms depot.",
      "Moldova's election commission said it was aware of reports of organised and illegal transports of voters by air and land in Russia, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Turkey, and appealed to the public to report further violations.",
      "Although Sandu had easily won the first round of the vote, several candidates swung behind Stoianoglo, although the third-placed candidate refused to back either of the two.",
      "The first round coincided with a nail-biting referendum on backing a change to the constitution embracing the commitment to join the EU.",
      "In the end the vote passed by a tiny margin in favour, and Maia Sandu said there had been clear evidence of attempts to buy 300,000 votes."

      "The teenager then had to endure being carried by his distraught father and other villagers on foot for two hours over hilly terrain to Adwa, which is the main town in the area about 162km (100 miles) north on the road from Tigray\u2019s capital, Mekelle \u2013 and not far from the Eritrean border.",
      "This was the location of the nearest hospital - and the medics there managed to save his life, but what was left of his leg had to be amputated. Parts of both his hands were also blown away.",
      "His farming village of Seyabo deep in the mountains of Tigray was littered with unexploded munitions in the wake of a civil war that ended in November 2022.",
      "These were mainly grenades, shells and other weapons left behind by fleeing fighters from both sides - no landmines are thought to have been planted in this area.",
      "The two-year conflict, which saw millions of people fleeing their homes and becoming dependent on aid, has been described as one of Africa\u2019s deadliest in recent decades.",
      "It broke out in late 2020 between allied Ethiopian and Eritrean troops on one side and local Tigrayan fighters on the other, both fighting for control of the region.",
      "An estimate by the African Union puts the number of people killed in the clashes and the humanitarian crisis prompted by the conflict as high as half a million.",
      "Yet two years on from the peace deal that ended the war, there are still people being killed and wounded by the remnants of warfare.",
      "Berhane had veered off the usual mountain footpath because he had spotted his family\u2019s sheep and goats grazing - and had gone over to stop them entering someone else\u2019s plot of land. This is when he stood on the explosive.",
      "Since 2023, the Red Cross says it has helped close to 400 victims of inadvertent explosions - 80% of them children.",

      "\"Ordnances are everywhere,\" his widow told the BBC.",
      "\"Officials tell us not to touch any metallic substance on the road.\"",
      "Efforts have been made to collect unexploded weapons - like in Gorero, a small village off the side of the main road to Adwa, where officials have combed farms and fields.",
      "But it is difficult to do extensive searches and local police chief Hadush Gebremedhin says he has asked his superiors for more support to conduct bigger sweeps.",
      "He has not heard back, meaning it is likely that resources are limited and bomb disposal experts in short supply.",
      "Mr Hadush\u2019s officers have removed the fuses from some of the weapons they have found, but even so he says extreme heat or accidental fire could detonate them.",
      "Weapons-clearing charities - with experience dealing with the aftermath of other African conflicts - might eventually step in, but it is an issue which requires massive co-ordination.",
      "In Adwa, officials who lack options to safely dispose of explosives carry them back at great personal risk to store them haphazardly in the compound of the town\u2019s peace and security office.",
      "Still the all-consuming fear that reigned over Berhane\u2019s village, where the sound of heavy gunfire once echoed through the mountains, has gone.",
      "Basic services like electricity and the internet, cut off during the war, have resumed allowing Seyabo and other villages, towns and cities to come back to life.",
      "Berhane was able to go back to school for the first time in years a few months after the conflict ended, but even before his accident last February, life for his family was far from normal.",
      "He lost his eldest brother, who was a fighter on the Tigrayan side, during the war.",
      "One of his sisters, also a fighter, sustained permanent injuries and is still receiving medical support in Mekelle.",
      "Another sister who had lived in a different part of Tigray was forced out of her home and has been unable to return, as her town is located in a disputed area claimed by both Tigray and the neighbouring region of Amhara.",
      "She had been living in a camp for displaced people in Adwa town until recently when she moved to help Berhane.",
      "As for Berhane, a humanitarian organisation has been able to provide him with a prosthetic leg and crutch, which has helped him walk again.",
      "He was not able to move back to Seyabo, as life there often involves taking strenuous hikes through the mountains.",
      "A usual 20-minute journey by foot to the village school would now take around an hour - so he has moved to Adwa, where he has rented a house with his sister.",
      "They are unclear how they will cover all their costs as his sister is still dependent on aid, but Berhane says this is the best way for him to continue at school.",
      "His new schoolmates help him write notes in class as the explosion also damaged his fingers and thumbs.",
      "\"I have mixed feelings,\" he told the BBC about his situation.",

      "\u201cI feel very proud to be standing here\u2026 with Russia on my left and North Korea on my right,\u201d declares one woman on a trip with her co-workers. \u201cThere are no borders among the people.\u201d",
      "That might be overly optimistic. Like the sliver of sandwiched Chinese territory she has travelled to see, Beijing too is caught between its sanctioned neighbours.",
      "Fears over the budding alliance between Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un have peaked in recent weeks, with reports of North Korea deploying thousands of troops to support Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And that was before Pyongyang fired a banned intercontinental missile on Thursday, on the longest flight recorded yet \u2013 after turning up the rhetoric against Seoul for weeks.",
      "\u201cChina seeks a relationship with a reasonable, high level of control over North Korea,\u201d says Christopher Green, an analyst from the International Crisis Group. \u201cAnd North Korea\u2019s relationship with Russia threatens to undermine that.\u201d",
      "If Chinese leader Xi Jinping is unable shape the Putin-Kim alliance to suit his interests, China may well remain stuck in the middle as western anger and anxiety grows.",
      "Moscow and Pyongyang deny that North Korean soldiers are headed for Ukraine, widely seen as a significant escalation. But the United States says it has seen evidence of this, following allegations by South Korean and Ukrainian intelligence.",
      "The first reports emerged just before Xi met his Russian counterpart at the Brics summit earlier in October, overshadowing a gathering that was meant to send the West a defiant message.",
      "It increasingly appears as though China\u2019s allies are spiralling out of its control. Beijing, the senior partner in the triad, seeks to be the stable leader of a new world order, one that is not led by the US. But that\u2019s difficult to do when one ally has started a war in Europe, and another is accused of aiding the invasion.",
      "\u201cChina is unhappy with the way things are going,\u201d Mr Green says, \u201cbut they are trying to keep their discontent relatively quiet.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s certainly a sensitive topic for Beijing, judging by the response to our presence in the border town, where it seems tourists are welcome - but journalists are not.",
      "We were in public areas at all times, and yet the team was stopped, repeatedly questioned, followed and our footage deleted.",
      "The hotel demanded to keep my passport for \u201cmy safety and the safety of others\u201d. Police visited our hotel rooms, and they also blocked the road to the port at Hunchun, which would have given us a closer view of the current trade between Russia and China.",
      "'Lips and teeth'",
      "On the viewing platform in Fangchuan, it\u2019s clear that most tourists have come to see North Korea.",
      "\u201cI saw a person cycling,\u201d says one girl peering through a telescope. Her friend  rushes over to see: \u201cOoooh! It\u2019s such a mysterious country.\u201d",
      "Close by is the Tumen river that gently cuts through all three countries. It is China\u2019s gateway into the Sea of Japan, where it has territorial disputes with Tokyo.",
      "The 1,400km-long (870 mile) Chinese border has some of the only platforms with a clear view into North Korea. South Korea\u2019s frontier with the North is an almost impenetrable barrier, the heavily mined and fortified Demilitarized Zone.",
      "Someone offers me a pair of binoculars. Some people are cycling through the village on ageing bicycles, but there are few other signs of life. One of the largest buildings is a school with a sign calling for children to \u201clearn well for Chosun\u201d, another name for North Korea.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has always been our neighbour. It\u2019s no stranger to us,\u201d says a middle-aged man. \u201cTo be able to see how they live makes me realise China is prosperous and strong.\u201d",
      "Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime would certainly struggle to survive without its biggest benefactor, China, which accounts for more than 90% of foreign trade, including food and fuel.",
      "That was not always the case. In the early 1960s it was the Chinese who fled famine across the Tumen river. Some even went to school in North Korea because they believed its education system at the time was better.",
      "The North Korean economy crashed after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2013 which had been its main source of aid and cheap oil - sparking severe food shortages and, eventually, famine.",
      "Soon, North Korean refugees began wading through an often freezing river at the risk of being shot dead to escape hunger, poverty and repression. There are now more than 30,000 of them in South Korea and an unknown number still live in China.",
      "\u201cSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Korea hasn\u2019t really had any choice but to maintain good relations with China, which has been its sole benefactor,\u201d Mr Green says.",
      "But now, he adds, Russia \u201cis offering an alternative and the North Koreans are seeking to exploit that\u201d.",
      "Mao Zedong, the first leader of the People\u2019s Republic of China, had likened the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang to the closeness between \u201clips and teeth\u201d: \u201cIf the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.\u201d",
      "\u2018The comrade from hell\u2019",
      "Now, Beijing finds itself smarting from a lack of gratitude as Kim\u2019s lips are \u201ckissing elsewhere\u201d, according to sociologist Aidan Foster-Carter, who has studied North Korea for several decades.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea has consistently been the comrade from hell to both Russia and China. They take as much money as they can and [then] do what they like.\u201d",
      "Analysts have noted that Kim has consistently flattered Putin over Xi in the last year. While Kim hasn\u2019t met Xi since 2019, he has met Putin twice in the past year or so. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has drawn the two sanctioned leaders closer than ever. Putin seeks more support for his war and Kim wants to bolster his regime with alliances and attention.",
      "From the Chinese border, it\u2019s easy to see the burgeoning relationship between the two sides.",
      "The whistle of a train interrupts the tourist chatter, and a steam engine pulling a long line of freight carriages slowly chugs across the railway bridge from Russia to North Korea. It stops in front of a Korean sign facing China which reads: \u201cTowards a new victory!\u201d",
      "The US estimates that Kim has sold more than a million artillery shells and Grad rockets to Moscow for use in Ukraine, which North Korea denies.",
      "But there is no doubt that the pair have stepped up cooperation after signing a security pact in June to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country.",
      "\u201cYou have very stiff and formal language to Xi Jinping on the occasion of what is actually an historically important event \u2013 the 75th anniversary of relations of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says.",
      "\u201cAnd yet on Putin\u2019s birthday, Kim calls him \u2018my closest comrade\u2019. If you are Xi Jinping, what are you thinking?\u201d",
      "'Through gritted teeth'",
      "It\u2019s hard to know, because China has shown no signs of interfering with the Russia-North Korea alliance.",
      "The US has noticed Beijing\u2019s disquiet and for once the two rivals may have similar goals.",
      "In the last week, State Department officials have raised the issue of North Korean troops in Russia with Chinese diplomats.",
      "Beijing does have options - in the past, they have cut supplies of oil and coal to North Korea, and complied with US-led sanctions to curb Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programme.",
      "Already, China is battling US accusations that it is selling components to Russia that aid its invasion of Ukraine. Beijing\u2019s trade with Moscow is also flourishing, even as it tries to cope with Western tariffs.",
      "Xi has kept Russia close because he needs Putin\u2019s help to challenge the US-led world order. But he has not stopped trying to repair ties with Europe, the UK and even the US. China has also been holding talks with Japan and South Korea to ease historic tensions.",
      "But Kim\u2019s increasingly aggressive rhetoric against Seoul has the South once again debating whether it should have its own nuclear arsenal. North Korean troops on a Ukrainian battlefield would only further unravel Beijing\u2019s plans.",
      "The possibility has already seen South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol discuss \"concrete counter-measures\" and talk of strengthening security cooperation with Ukraine and Nato.",
      "A nuclear-armed South Korea or an \u201cEast Asian Nato\u201d are not ideal in a region where China wants greater sway. An emboldened Kim could also draw a stronger show of support from the US \u2013 in the form of warships or even weapons - towards its allies, Seoul and Tokyo.",
      "\u201cFor a very long time, China has had a policy of three nos in Northeast Asia \u2013 one of those nos was a no nuclear North Korea. Obviously that has been a failure,\u201d Mr Green says.",
      "Now Beijing fears that the alliance with Russia could destabilise North Korea, he adds: \u201cThat could even benefit Vladimir Putin in a way it really would not benefit Xi Jinping.\u201d",
      "Experts say Beijing is just as worried as the West about what military technology Putin might sell to Kim in exchange for troops.",
      "\u201cSatellites, for sure,\u201d Mr Foster-Carter says. \u201cBut Putin is bad \u2013 not mad. Russia knows just as China knows that North Korea is a loose cannon. Giving [Kim] more technology for nukes is not a good thing for anybody.\u201d",
      "Experts believe Xi is unlikely to do anything drastic because China needs a stable North Korea \u2013 if he cuts off aid, he would likely have a refugee crisis at the border.",
      "But Kim too might have a decision to make.",
      "Although Russia is paying for shells and troops, Mr Foster-Carter says, it is China that \"has actually kept North Korea going all this time, often through gritted teeth. I just wonder at what point Beijing will turn on Pyongyang?\u201d.",
      "Kim's deadly gamble could also have a profound impact closer to home - the 25 million North Koreans who are cut off from the outside world and completely dependent on the regime for their survival.",
      "Across the Tumen river in Fangchuan, a North Korean soldier watches us, while we watch him.",
      "Steam rises from snack stands selling noodles and sizzled octopus on sticks on the Chinese side. And he can probably hear the giggling tourists taking pictures with the latest cameras and phones, which he is forbidden from owning.",
      "The shallow river is a gulf neither the tourists nor the soldier can cross.",
      "Are North Korean troops joining Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine?",

      "A day before, President Joe Biden had dropped out of the election race and endorsed her to succeed him as Democratic candidate. With only a short period of campaigning ahead of her, Harris had no time to waste.",
      "There is a saying in politics: define yourself or be defined by your opponent. And in that moment, when Harris made her first pitch to the American people, she defined herself not just in terms of her record in the White House or as a US senator, but the years she spent as a California prosecutor.",
      "\u201cI took on perpetrators of all kinds - predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type,\u201d she said of her Republican challenger.",
      "The line has been repeated often at her campaign rallies and stump speeches, as the 60-year-old has sought to frame this election as a contest between a hard-bitten prosecutor and a convicted felon, constantly reminding voters of Trump\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "How Donald Trump came back from the political abyss",
      "But a look back at Harris\u2019s time in and out of California's courtrooms reveals her enduring struggle to define herself, what her opponents say is a history of pivoting on issues depending on the political weather, as well as her uncanny ability to seize the moment when others have counted her out.",
      "Street murders and rough San Francisco politics",
      "Harris\u2019s time in law enforcement began just out of law school in Alameda County, California - which includes the cities of Berkeley and her hometown of Oakland.",
      "During the 1990s, in the midst of the government's \"war on drugs\", Oakland struggled with violent crime.",
      "For a junior prosecutor, the job was daunting. But the severity of the cases you had to deal with meant it was considered a top job for a young and ambitious attorney, said Teresa Drenick, who worked with Harris at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was like a potboiler of an atmosphere. The amount of grief and agony you ingested every day was hard to process. For us, it was intense. The stakes being high, the crimes being so serious,\u201d she told the BBC.",
      "\"It was near the height of the crack-cocaine epidemic. There were gang murders, street corner murders taking place. There was a lot going on in Oakland that enabled you as a prosecutor to handle some of the most serious cases that a prosecutor is ever going to handle.\"",
      "Ms Drenick and Harris were on the same trial team together. She admired Harris\u2019s confidence in front of a jury, and her respect for her colleague only grew when Harris was transferred to a different team in the same courthouse focused on child sexual assault.",
      "\"She was very, very caring of victims of child abuse. She was able to speak to them in a way that allowed them to open up to her,\u201d she said.",
      "It was at this time that Harris dated Willie Brown, a local political kingmaker and speaker of the California State Assembly who helped launch the careers of some of the state\u2019s other most prominent political leaders, including Gavin Newsom, the current governor, and San Francisco Mayor London Breed.",
      "Brown appointed her to two state boards and introduced her to some of San Francisco\u2019s highest-profile Democratic donors. The short-lived romance ended by the time Brown was elected as the city\u2019s mayor in 1995. Three years later, Harris took a job at the San Francisco district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "During her relationship with Brown, who was 30 years her senior, Harris had begun mingling with some of the city\u2019s political heavyweights.",
      "San Francisco's political machine, which Harris has described as \u201ca bare-knuckled sport\u201d, has launched the careers of some of the nation\u2019s biggest political stalwarts including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the late Senator Dianne Feinstein.",
      "Harris forged relationships with both of them, rising alongside contemporaries like Newsom, as she found her feet in the political world.",
      "Her swift rise through San Francisco\u2019s rough-and-tumble politics were defined by days in courtrooms representing victims and nights at glitzy political galas.",
      "This was also around the time that Harris met one of her closest friends \u2013 and most significant donors - Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.",
      "Jobs donated $500 to Harris\u2019s 2003 campaign for San Francisco district attorney, which she won, toppling the man who had hired her. Twenty years later, the billionaire philanthropist donated nearly $1m to the Biden-Harris re-election campaign, according to Fortune Magazine. It\u2019s not known how much she has directly contributed to Harris\u2019s bid for the presidency, but the amount is considered substantial.",
      "\u2018No exception to principle\u2019",
      "On the day before Easter in 2004, just four months into Kamala Harris\u2019s tenure as the district attorney of San Francisco, a gang member brandishing an AK-47 rifle fatally shot a 29-year old police officer named Isaac Espinoza.",
      "The slaying stunned the city, with many politicians and prominent members of the police calling for the death penalty.",
      "But Harris, who had made opposition to capital punishment a key part of her political campaign to become the city\u2019s top prosecutor, instead decided to pursue a life sentence without parole. She made her decision public just 48 hours after the murder, without informing the widow first.",
      "\u201cShe did not call me,\u201d Espinoza told CNN in 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why she went on camera to say that without talking to the family. It\u2019s like, you can\u2019t even wait till he\u2019s buried?\u201d",
      "The backlash was swift. Speaking at the officer\u2019s funeral, Senator Feinstein demanded his killer \u201cpay the ultimate price\u201d. While walking out of the church service, she told reporters that had she known Harris was against the death penalty, she probably wouldn't have endorsed her.",
      "\u201c[T]here can be no exception to principle,\u201d Harris later wrote in an opinion piece in the San Francisco Chronicle, defending her decision.",
      "Long-time civil rights attorney John Burris, who supported Harris\u2019s decision at the time, said he thought it was \u201cpolitically was not wise for her, but it was a philosophical position she took\u201d.",
      "\"She was pretty bold in her position and she did take a lot of heat for it,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat was a pretty progressive stand.\u201d",
      "The incident could have been the end of her political ambitions, but Harris, who had grown up with a single mother in the working-class city of Oakland, carried on.",
      "\u201cIs she a political animal? Absolutely not. Is she naturally skilled? Yes,\u201d said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris\u2019s two successful campaigns for California attorney general in 2010 and 2014. \u201cFor her, politics is the means to the end. She is focused on the end result and the impact she can have on people\u2019s lives less than the process.\u201d",
      "Harris seemed to absorb some lessons from her first major decision as San Francisco district attorney. Four years later, she again declined to pursue the death penalty after a dramatic killing, but this time, she better understood how her decision would reverberate.",
      "Tony Bologna had been driving in San Francisco with his three sons when their vehicle was barraged by gunfire. Bologna and two of his sons were killed; his third son was critically injured.",
      "Shortly after the killing, police arrested Edwin Ramon Uma\u00f1a, an undocumented member of the MS-13 gang who had evidently mistaken the 49-year old Bologna for a sworn enemy.",
      "This time, Harris opted to deliver the difficult news about her prosecutorial decision to Bologna\u2019s widow Danielle herself, recalls Matt Davis, who was representing Danielle Bologna in a civil suit against the city at the time.",
      "\u201cIt was no surprise that Danielle had a very strong, negative reaction to the news,\u201d Mr Davis told the BBC in a recent interview. \u201cShe made it clear that she was upset, and Kamala listened to her and expressed her sympathies but stayed pretty firm.\u201d",
      "The meeting left an indelible impression on Davis. He had befriended Harris in law school in San Francisco, and when she had first revealed her plans to run for D.A., he remembers thinking she didn\u2019t have a chance.",
      "But he says that painful conversation made him realise he had underestimated her.",
      "\u201cThat was not an easy thing to do,\u201d Mr Davis said.",
      "Progressive prosecutor?",
      "Over the span of her law enforcement career, Harris\u2019s allies sought to paint her as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor\u201d committed to criminal justice reform but also tough on crime.",
      "It was a fine line to walk in a liberal city in the country\u2019s largest left-leaning state, and one that critics on both sides of the political aisle say she did not stick to.",
      "As district attorney, she adopted a so-called \u201csmart-on-crime\u201d philosophy, which included initiatives to keep non-violent offenders out of prison by steering them into job training programs and ensuring young offenders remained in school.",
      "Niki Solis, an attorney in the San Francisco public defender\u2019s office who worked opposite Harris in the early 2000s, said she had been receptive to her concerns about how young victims of sex trafficking were being charged with prostitution, as opposed to being treated as victims.",
      "\u201cI realised that she understood issues that a lot of her predecessors and a lot of [district attorneys] up and down the state failed to understand or even acknowledge,\u201d said Ms Solis.",
      "Trump and his allies on the right have sought to play up this time in her career, depicting her as part of a \u201cSan Francisco liberal elite\u201d. But on the left of politics, she has been accused of not being reform-minded enough, with some on social media nicknaming her \u201cKamala the cop\u201d.",
      "But by the time Harris was elected as California\u2019s attorney general, in 2010, her progressive tendencies appeared to have given way to political pragmatism.",
      "\"She was seeking more of a national profile. She wanted to make a mark. There was definitely an expectation of an interesting future to come,\u201d said Gil Duran, who worked for Harris in the attorney general\u2019s office for a few months.",
      "\"The attorney general - usually a sleepy backwater of an office - was now home to a rising star.\"",
      "On the national stage, Harris began to make her mark. In 2012, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, Harris threatened to walk away from negotiations on a financial settlement between state attorneys general and five US banks. California was set to receive around $4 billion in the initial deal, and Harris eventually secured $18 billion for the state.",
      "The Harris campaign has highlighted this case on the campaign trail as more proof she\u2019s willing to stand up to powerful interests.",
      "But more recent reporting shows that only $4.5 billion of the settlement ended up going towards California homeowners who had been ripped off by lenders.",
      "In moves that angered some liberals, she implemented a school truancy program state-wide, which some county prosecutors used to arrest parents. And she defied a Supreme Court order to reduce overcrowding in the state\u2019s prisons.",
      "She also reversed her previous position on the death penalty in 2014 when, as attorney general, she appealed a lower court\u2019s ruling that found it was unconstitutional. Now, the prosecutor who once refused to sentence violent murderers to death on the basis that \"there is no exception to principle\" was defending the state\u2019s right to do just that.",
      "Hadar Aviram, a criminal justice and civil rights professor who petitioned Harris to leave the decision in place, was one of many critics of her stance.",
      "\u201cYou are not under any obligation to defend things that are morally unjust,\u201d she told CNN in 2019 of the episode. \u201cIf you truly believe that they\u2019re morally unjust and you have an opportunity to take a stand, I think it\u2019s an imperative to do so.\u201d",
      "Former San Francisco city attorney Louise Renne, who worked with Harris when she first left Oakland, said the torrent of criticism she faced over her support for the death penalty was unfair.",
      "\u201cThe thing is when you\u2019re state attorney general, you have to defend the law. That\u2019s your obligation,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201c I don\u2019t regard that as a weakness or a valid criticism at all.\u201d",
      "But Harris was selective about which laws she enforced. In 2004, when Gavin Newsom, then San Francisco's mayor, decided to allow same-sex weddings, in violation of state law, Harris helped officiate a few of the ceremonies, calling it \u201cone of the most joyful\u201d moments of her career.",
      "Her long record as a prosecutor would prove tricky when, after being elected to the US Senate in 2016, Harris decided to run for the Democratic presidential nomination.",
      "She chose to kick off her 2020 presidential run just blocks away from the Alameda County Courthouse, the same place where she first uttered the words, \u201cfor the people\u201d \u2013 which would become part of her campaign slogan.",
      "But in the midst of her campaign, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, was murdered by a police officer during an arrest, igniting a nationwide racial reckoning and demand for criminal justice reform. Her past defence of the death penalty, and resistance to prison reform, earned her criticism from her party\u2019s left-flank.",
      "She dropped out of the presidential race before the primary contests to choose a Democratic contender had even begun.",
      "Reinvented again",
      "Now, as Harris campaigns for president against Donald Trump, she is again calling attention to her prosecutorial bona-fides, but reframed in a new political atmosphere.",
      "While many cities, including San Francisco, experimented with progressive police reform after Floyd\u2019s murder, a spike in crime and homelessness during the pandemic has triggered a public backlash against so-called \u201csoft on crime\u201d policies. Republicans have also heavily focused on political messaging around crime and public safety in recent years.",
      "Harris\u2019s past as a prosecutor is no longer such a liability, and in a race against the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes, the narrative aligns with the political moment.",
      "Notably, at the Democratic National Convention this summer, abolishing the death penalty was dropped from the party platform.",
      "And while in 2020, Harris was trying to win over left-leaning Democrats, she is now explicitly making a pitch for moderate Republicans who may be fed up with Trump. To do that, she has shifted a number of her positions - from border security to single-payer health care - to the centre.",
      "This has led to accusations from her opponents that she is a flip-flopper.",
      "She\u2019s \u201ca chameleon\u201d, Trump\u2019s running mate and Ohio Senator JD Vance told CNN in August. \u201cShe pretends to be one thing in front of one audience and she pretends to be something different in front of another audience.\u201d",
      "But Mr Duran, Harris's former colleague in the attorney general\u2019s office, sees it less as a matter of political scrupulousness and more simply a sign of her political pragmatism.",
      "\"I think she does have conviction but it\u2019s really hard to run a campaign on your convictions alone, for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Kamala Harris we\u2019re seeing now is very much poll and focus-group driven.\u201d",
      "What Harris really stands for has been a question that has dogged her throughout her career - and continues to follow her on her bid for the Oval Office. But to Mr Brokaw, her former campaign manager, she has always operated on her own terms.",
      "\u201cShe has carved her own path and left a whole bunch of people behind who counted her out and underestimated her,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Two UK-based Africans tell the BBC how they are digging deep into their culture to change home decor.",
    "story": [
      "After more than a decade as a lawyer at high-powered banking firms like Goldman Sachs and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Nigerian-British Kelechi Ejikeme left the corporate world to follow her passion for interior design.",
      "Her rug collection is inspired by Nigeria's diverse terrain - rolling hills, winding rivers, sprawling savannahs and dense forests, and reminds me of the view from planes.",
      "\"So, when you interpret that into a rug or a carpet, it\u2019s symbolic,\" she said when I met her at her stall at the Decorex interior design show held in London last month.",
      "\"It\u2019s like, every minute, this is what we're actually every day stepping on.\"",
      "Made from jute, a durable and eco-friendly material, each rug integrates these natural elements.",
      "Jute is typically cultivated locally for its edible leaves, not for fibre. It comes from the same plant used for ewedu soup, a staple in south-western Nigeria.",
      "To bring her vision to life, Ejikeme has her rugs produced in India and Nepal, where jute is more widely developed into a thriving industry.",
      "Also at the event was Amechi Mandi, a Cameroonian-Nigerian interior designer who won House & Garden magazine\u2019s Rising Star award in 2022.",
      "He was not showcasing any of his work but had just spoken in a side session about his transition from fashion to interior design.",
      "Mandi holds a degree in furniture and product design, but after working in the fashion industry and later at a design firm, he became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of genuine African-inspired interior textiles.",
      "Too often, he found, they relied on \"clich\u00e9d\", post-colonial motifs.",
      "This led him to explore his Cameroonian and Nigerian heritage, with a focus on pre-colonial traditions.",
      "Recognising the untapped potential of indigenous textiles fading from memory -especially with the rise of \"ankara\" wax prints, a European import that has come to symbolise African design - Mandi set out to revive these cultural elements.",
      "He began integrating traditional techniques and patterns into his designs, and his work now includes a popular collection of cushions and throws, as well as a successful wallpaper collaboration.",
      "\"People have told me, 'Oh, your work is not African,' because they want to see ankara prints. It's been so impressed in the minds,\" Mandi told me.",
      "\"I get inspiration from indigenous traditions and cultures, and then, I give it a more contemporary spin,\" he added.",
      "Listening to Mandi made me realise how much I, too, had come to associate modern African design with ankara fabrics.",
      "This textile has dominated African fashion and design, making its mark on global stages in recent decades.",
      "And so, as I wandered through the exhibition, it was easy to assume that African designs were absent from this notable gathering.",
      "When she first started, Ejikeme juggled both law and interior design, working in one during the week and the other on weekends. It did not take long for her to realise where her true passion lay.",
      "\"In one world, you\u2019re trying to contain your energy or yourself or your expression just so that you don\u2019t ruffle feathers, while in another world your energy, you can\u2019t even extinguish it,\" she said.",
      "Since making the leap to full-time design six years ago, she has tackled a variety of projects, from homes and workplaces to movie sets.",
      "Last year, she launched her own rug collection, adding a new dimension to her work from her Swallow and Tea studio.",
      "\"It\u2019s a really new thing and I\u2019ve only had two shows but so far I\u2019ve had mostly residential and retail buyers mainly from Europe probably because my first show was in Belgium. Decorex was my first UK show,\" Ejikeme said.",
      "Most of Mandi\u2019s customers are Europeans, a trend he attributes to a prevailing preference among many Africans for foreign products.",
      "\"Most Africans still prefer to buy a Gucci,\" he said.",
      "\"I do have a few Africans buying but they are not like everyday Africans. They were all people who were born and bred abroad and are deep into African heritage and culture.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi concur that interior design in Africa is still in its developmental stages.",
      "In contrast to fashion, which has long been a significant focus for Africans and has recently experienced remarkable growth, the field of African interior design is just starting to establish itself.",
      "Ejikeme reflected on her first independent project in 2013, which coincided with a new wave of Africans in London entering high-paying fields like investment banking.",
      "She aimed to create spaces that not only exuded luxury and comfort but also captured a sense of home for her African clients, reflecting their heritage in a meaningful way.",
      "\"I was stumped because I'm somebody who loves antiques. I love old design. When I was in design school in London, my favourite thing was history of design, like learning about all the different periods - Victorian, Edwardian, etc - and what distinguished one from the other.",
      "\"But there was no such thing in Africa. There's nothing like the history of African design because we haven't really kept that track,\" she said.",
      "This realisation motivated her to begin categorising African design periods to better understand and preserve the continent's design evolution, an ongoing project she began during her past 10 years living in Nigeria before returning to London last year.",
      "Ejikeme visited places like the Bogobiri art gallery in Lagos, which displayed a mixture of old sculpture and modern art.",
      "She also visited sellers in quiet corners of Nigerian markets, where she came across staffs of office used by Igbo elders in precolonial times. She began categorising these objects she came across according to their period in history, whether late 1990s or pre-colonial.",
      "She has not yet finished and wants to devote more time to it to use them in her interior design projects.",
      "Mandi believes that following trends in how we design our homes and other spaces was historically never an African thing, especially with the centuries of the transatlantic slave trade.",
      "\"Traditionally, interiors have never been a priority. We have always been into functionality. We were more into decorating our exteriors, like painting the walls, painting the outside,\" he said.",
      "\"Each civilization has evolved, but we didn\u2019t have the chance to evolve because of the 400 years we were arrested with the transatlantic slave trade.\"",
      "He added that Africans were in \"constant flight\" during the slave trade, so \"how can you think, 'I have this house, I have to make the inside fine, let me put that bench, let me weave this cloth'? Our society didn't have the chance to evolve like that.\"",
      "Both Ejikeme and Mandi noted that many wealthy and prominent Africans, from celebrities to entrepreneurs, often have interiors that lack a distinctly African identity.",
      "However, Ejikeme believes this is changing as more Africans gain disposable income, they are increasingly investing in decorating their homes in a way that tells their personal story and captures their experiences.",
      "\"If you have a product that can be made beautiful, and exquisite, and sort of memorable, that tells some kind of story or has some kind of meaning, it will appeal to Africans and other people that are not African,\" she says.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 00:51:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Why are still no closer to unmasking the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto?",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.",
      "But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?",
      "Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.",
      "So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference.",
      "There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.",
      "Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase.",
      "But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.",
      "Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday\u2019s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling.",
      "A front row seat would be \u00a3100. It was another \u00a350 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend \u00a3500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing \"Satoshi\" on stage.",
      "I declined.",
      "Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation.",
      "As it happened, seating wasn\u2019t a problem.",
      "Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.",
      "Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.",
      "After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.",
      "It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.",
      "Mr Anderson invited \"Satoshi\" to come on stage.",
      "A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: \u201cI am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.\u201d",
      "Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.",
      "Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do.",
      "But he didn't.",
      "I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.",
      "What is Bitcoin? Key crypto terms and what they mean",
      "Not another one",
      "The list of those identified - unsuccessfully - as Satoshi Nakamoto is long.",
      "In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek said it was Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California.",
      "But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.",
      "A year later, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was outed as Satoshi by reporters.",
      "He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.",
      "In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.",
      "Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.",
      "Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?",
      "The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.",
      "Perhaps there\u2019s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.",
      "Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.",
      "Many in the crypto world enjoy the fact that the mystery remains unsolved.",
      "\"No-one knows who Satoshi is and that's a good thing,\" Adam Back, one of its core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X recently.",
      "Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin podcaster, thinks Satoshi's anonymity is not only deliberate but essential.",
      "\"By concealing his true identity, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wouldn\u2019t have a leader or central figure, whose personal agenda could influence the protocol,\" she told me.",
      "\"This allows people to trust Bitcoin as a system, rather than placing their trust in an individual or company.\"",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University - who lectures on the history of Bitcoin - is less sure.",
      "In her view, the circus around who Satoshi Nakamoto is distracts from people looking into - and getting to grips with - the more serious question of how cryptocurrencies might upend the way the economy works.",

      "Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.",
      "What went wrong?",
      "According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.",
      "Firstly, it didn\u2019t really have a continuing business model \u2013 once you\u2019d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for.",

      "What happens to the DNA?",
      "Companies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.",
      "\"It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,\" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.",
      "And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.",
      "\"If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,\" she told the BBC.",

She\u2019s been involved in the school\u2019s young Democrats club, knocking on doors, sending flyers and making phone calls to try to convince people to vote for Harris.",

      "Democrats in general have had an especially tough time with white, non-college educated voters, male and female.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hired by the campaign.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: He spoke two hours before Trump.",
      "Well, again, I think what's more relevant, if you want to say \u2013 so, it had to be done in hindsight, the guy probably doesn't get invited, OK, especially with a joke like that.",
      "But I think more relevant is the fact that the sitting president of the United States said out loud what most people in the Democratic Party and hierarchy believe, and that is that anyone who votes for Donald Trump is garbage, is a racist, is a hater, is a Nazi, as \u2013 as the vice president candidate of theirs has accused anyone who attended the Madison Square Garden rally.",
      "MSNBC was running images of Nazi rallies from Germany side by side with images from Madison Square Garden a week ago. So, there \u2013 you asked me, why are they so confident?",
      "If you're so confident about victory, the way that the Harris people say they are, then why would you be out there attacking not Donald Trump, attacking anyone who is thinking about voting for him by labeling them as, if you vote for Donald Trump, you're this evil, horrible human being?",
      "That doesn't seem to be like the actions of a confident campaign. It seems to me like the actions of a scared one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I was speaking specifically about that \u2013 that outreach that you've been doing to Hispanic voters. It sounds like you think this is negligible.",
      "But let me ask you about women voters, because we're seeing in our data that the Trump campaign may have an issue there.",
      "Here's what former Trump administration U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said this past week about that Madison Square Garden rally.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "FORMER GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY (R-South Carolina): This bromance and this masculinity stuff, I mean, it borders on edgy, to the point that it's going to make women uncomfortable. You have got affiliated PACs that are doing commercials about calling Kamala the C-word. Or you had speakers at Madison Square Garden referring to her and her pimps.",
      "That is not the way to win women.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you share the former governor's concerns that this is a vulnerability?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I want to point out, and no one talks about this, Kamala Harris has a bigger problem among men than Donald Trump does among women.",
      "Are there women that are going to vote for Kamala Harris? Of course. Are there women that don't like Donald Trump? Of course. Are there women that are going to support Donald Trump? Yes, there are, a lot of them.",
      "And I think you'll see that bear out on Election Day. Ultimately, the bottom line is that what this election is going to be about, when people go vote, they're not \u2013 they're going to be voting on three things that are critical to them. How much does it cost to live in this country, and can you afford the things that people work hard to be able to afford? Because over the last four years, they have not.",
      "Do you feel safe and secure? And the answer is, no, people do not face \u2013 feel safe and secure, when you have dangerous criminal elements entering this country across the open border that Kamala Harris allowed. And number three is, how close is this country to being dragged into some sort of global conflict?",
      "We now have troops from North Korea side by side with Russians on the ground in Ukraine. We're edging closer every single month to some broader global conflict that could involve the United States. And guess who's going to have to go fight in those wars? The sons and the daughters and the children of the people who are going to decide this election, and that includes over half the country, which is women voters.",
      "That's what's going to be on people's mind, and that's what should be on their mind, because that's what's at stake in this election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of safety and security, that sound bite a moment ago from Donald Trump talking about training guns on the face of Liz Cheney, the Trump campaign\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: That's not what he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 says that was about foreign policy.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: It was\u2026;",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just played it for our viewers and listeners who heard it.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't it possible to make the case without using rhetoric like that?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But Donald Trump doesn't talk like someone who's been in Washington for 30 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Training guns on her face?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: He doesn't say it the way I would have said it. No, but that's not what he said, Margaret. You guys know that. Come on.",
      "I mean, everybody knows exactly what he was saying. What he was saying is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We played the sound bite.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 you're so much in favor of war.",
      "Yes, you \u2013 no, you played a piece of the sound bite, because, in another piece of it, he said he would give her a gun to go stand in conflict as well. You don't normally give a gun to someone that is going to be facing a firing squad, which is what much of the media made it sound like.",
      "The point he was making is not a new point. It is a point that has been made by people in both parties for decades. And that is, you're all for war, and it's easy to be for war when you're in some fancy building and you're safe and sound in Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Let's see how much you are for war when you yourself get deployed into combat. That's the point that he was making.",
      "That he uses language that maybe is not what we typically hear from someone that works at a think tank\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 well, fine.",
      "But I think it's truly, not just unfair, it's egregious to see that reported the way that it was, along with other things that are out there. I have never seen such a concerted effort.",
      "And, look, I have always believed there's bias, because no one's unbiased, but I have never seen such a concerted effort like what I have seen, especially in the last two weeks, among multiple media outlets in this country to, in some cases, breathlessly distort and lie about what's being said and to create and manufacture these gotcha moments against Donald Trump.",
      "I have never seen it before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: It's over the top.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, you are the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee. You also know that former commander in chief is not just some guy off the street, and words matter.",
      "U.S. intelligence has specifically warned\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: They do matter. They do matter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 specifically warned about the risk of political violence in this country, some of it stoked by foreign adversaries, Iran trying to do that, Russia trying to do that, in the days after the election.",
      "Are you confident in the security and the integrity of the election?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm confident in the security and integrity of the elections, and especially because we have strong systems across this country.",
      "It's spread across 50 states. That doesn't mean there aren't going to be problems. We saw problems earlier in the week in Pennsylvania, and they were resolved by a court, where people were not allowed \u2013 being allowed in one county from accessing their on-demand mail ballot at the spot. There are going to be issues like that.",
      "They're being confronted at the front end, and those things are being looked at. Look, in the state of Michigan, we know now \u2013 and this is not me making it up. I can't believe it hasn't received more coverage. A Chinese national registered to vote and voted. And now he's being charged for doing that. But guess what? His ballot is going to count.",
      "We know at least one noncitizen's ballot is going to count in Michigan because they don't know which ballot it is and they can't retrieve it. These are facts. Now, whether that's widespread or not, I hope not, but these are things that are happening, and they need to be watched at.",
      "As far as foreign adversaries, sure. I mean, Iran wants to kill Donald Trump. Iran \u2013 this has been fully documented. They are trying to kill Donald Trump. You talk about violent rhetoric. He's the only candidate in this race, and not because I wish this on anybody else, who's had not one, but two assassination attempts against his life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: So, of course we're all concerned about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "In terms of the case you talked about in Michigan, we have tracked that. The secretary of state of that state has actually brought charges, has made that public. That individual may actually be deported\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Yes. But that vote's still going to count.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 may actually be deported because there are laws in this country that punish people\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: They are. But the vote still counts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 when they are illegal, and they try to vote in federal elections. That 19-year-old is going to face some consequences.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Correct. But the vote still counts.",
      "He is. And he's going to \u2013 but his vote still counts. His vote will still be counted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. I'm just trying to make clear that there are systems\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But that's a big deal. I think that's a big deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 as you pointed to, as the courts are also playing a role here.",
      "I need to ask you about China, though. This massive and pervasive hacking by China of U.S. telecom companies is significant. Your colleague Mark Warner said it's the most significant breach he has ever seen in his entire time on the committee.",
      "Do you know if China has been able to access the audio of Americans' phone calls?",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to comment on what they access, but I agree with Mark Warner's statement.",
      "It is an egregious, outrageous and dangerous breach of our telecommunications systems across multiple companies. I will leave it at that. I think, as time goes on, we're going to learn more about it. Some of it will be made public. I think there's more that's still being gathered.",
      "It's a very serious situation that we face and I think one that is quite threatening, maybe not directly to the election\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 per se, but certainly to the national security of our country moving forward. It's a vulnerability that no one imagined or anticipated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: But here it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Senator Rubio, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined by Nevada Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, who joins us from Las Vegas.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO (D-Nevada): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to be tracking your state very closely and all six of its electoral votes.",
      "In this early vote, we've seen half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, and there's some anxiety among Democrats because Republicans currently have a lead statewide. Are you confident the remaining ballots will close that gap and deliver the state to Harris?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, Margaret, I can tell you a couple of things.",
      "One, I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen, in this state. I am absolutely confident in our ground game, in our canvassing and knocking on doors and talking to our voters, because that's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them, because there's so much information out there.",
      "And now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about. So, yes, I am very, very confident.",
      "And the only other thing, let me say this, Margaret, is, you know, I was reelected just recently, and there was a Republican advantage in my race, in my midterm, and I won. Not only did I win. Our congressional delegation won. And so we also won our \u2013 our state seats in our state House.",
      "So what we know in Nevada, it is really about that organization. It's knocking on those doors. It's phone-banking. It's talking to our voters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: We also have a large population of our voters who are nonpartisan. Over a third are nonpartisan. And those are the independents in other states, and they lean Democratic. They leaned my way.",
      "And so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you mentioned your victory in 2022. That was just by 8,000 votes. So this \u2013 this could be a tight one as well this time around.",
      "The Trump campaign talks about making inroads with the working-class population, in particular, on the issue of the economy. Your state has the second highest unemployment rate in the country. The majority of voters do not have a college degree.",
      "Why shouldn't the Trump campaign be confident that they are making inroads with this key demographic?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, a couple of things, Margaret. You talked about my \u2013 my tight race. They're always tight in Nevada. It's a swing state. They're always close. It's always within the margin.",
      "And that's why it is important you get out and talk to voters and you don't take anyone for granted. And you're right. A large part of our population, our service industry, those are high school-educated individuals. That's my family. They worked in this industry.",
      "And these are the individuals we want to talk to. But we also have been engaging them on the issues that matter to them. And if you look at our strong organized labor, which is the culinary, which is made up most of the service industry, along with our building trades, they're knocking on those doors in favor of the Democrats, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",
      "So there is this outright concerted effort by everyone to make sure our voters understand who is \u2013 what's at stake here. And there's a stark difference. I mean, you know, let me just say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: \u2026 because this is important for voters to know this, that Kamala Harris has already talked about, she wants to represent everyone. She wants to lift everybody up.",
      "No matter who voted for her, she's going to represent them. She's going to start day one with a to-do list to how she works on the issues that she knows that many voters are challenged with. Donald Trump is going to walk in the Oval Office with an enemies list. There's a difference between the two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And when you talk to voters about it who are expecting that in Nevada, in a swing state, that makes the difference in whether or not we are going to win. And we are going to win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But does your party \u2013 we played what the current president, Joe Biden, said about Trump supporters, and some have compared that, Republicans have compared that to what Hillary Clinton said about a basket of deplorables.",
      "Does your party have a disdain problem in talking down to working class voters in particular?",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Well, I can tell you here in Nevada in general \u2013 first of all, let's just say, but \u2013 we know this, that President Biden clarified his statement, and Kamala Harris has made it very clear she wants to represent everyone, no matter\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he quibbled about an apostrophe in the transcript.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: But \u2013 but Kamala Harris made it very clear moving forward that she wants to represent everyone, right, no matter whether you voted for her or not.",
      "And whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that. And she's made that very clear.",
      "What \u2013 what I hear from voters in Nevada \u2013 and this is where the \u2013 where it's relevant, not the spin rooms, not the polls, not what you're hearing on the national news, but what are voters saying, and what do they care about? And they're listening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: And I can tell you, my voters in Nevada that I talk to, which is really a large population of not only our blue- collar, but minority Latinos, a \u2013 excuse me, Asian American Pacific Islanders, a vibrant Black community, Native Americans \u2013 they are listening to, what are the issues?",
      "Who's bringing the solutions, right? Who has the solutions to address the affordable housing issue? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO: Who has the issues to address how we lower health care costs and keep them low for all Americans? Kamala Harris. Who has the idea about how we protect the Affordable Care Act and not repeal it? That's Kamala Harris.",
      "So those conversations matter to my voters in Nevada, and that's what's relevant at the end of the day and how we're going to make this happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And your state also will be key to watch. You do have abortion on the ballot.",
      "Even though it's already legal in your state, there is talk about enshrining it in the Constitution, based on what happens Tuesday. We'll be following that and what happens with your party.",
      "Senator, we have to leave it there for time. Thank you.",
      "We'll be back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Be sure to tune into CBS News on Tuesday night, when we will be live from our election headquarters in New York City. I will be there, along with Norah O'Donnell, John Dickerson, Gayle King, and the rest of our political team for what is likely to be a very long night.",
      "Our coverage starts at 4:00 p.m. Eastern on CBS News 24/7 Streaming, 7:00 p.m. Eastern on the CBS television network.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, and our panel of election law and security experts.",
      "David Becker is the executive director of the Center for Election, Innovation and Research. Chris Krebs is the former head of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Trump administration. And Samantha Vinograd was most recently a counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration.",
      "Good morning to you all.",
      "Setting the table for a consequential week.",
      "Chris, I want to start with you.",
      "We're in that 48-hour window that Microsoft warned was going to be rife with attempts to hack people's minds. We've seen at least four fake videos the FBI and U.S. intelligence have warned are meant to manipulate. Yesterday, the FBI said there were two out there that are fake. Before that we had disclosed that Russia was behind a Bucks County, Pennsylvania, fake video and one targeting voters in Georgia, falsely claiming that Haitian migrants were - were voting.",
      "How do these tactics that Russia is using now compare to what you saw in 2020 and back in 2016?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, they've evolved their techniques from generating and launching content from, for instance, St. Petersburg. That's what we saw in 2016. You had the internet research agency operating out of an office building, almost like, you know, a normal business.",
      "Over time, though, given the improvements in the intelligence community, cyber command, and our own awareness of the activities and what they're doing, they've started to push the boundaries out. And so they're actually generating content and then they're laundering it effectively through other platforms, like Telegram and even now what we're seeing is a significant amount of laundering through X.",
      "And then U.S. citizens pick up this information and pick up these videos, and then they promote it on their own accounts and on their own social media platforms, like Facebook. So, they are moving it out. They're avoiding the techniques that U.S. law enforcement intelligence has deployed and developed. And so they're not as good though. So, a lot of these videos that we're seeing, they're actually quite amateurish. That's not to say they can't have better content coming forward, but really they're just kind of flooding the zone and trying to distract.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And confuse and sow - and sow distrust of our institutions.",
      "Sam, U.S. intelligence has been briefing and disclosing. That's part of what they're doing to try to counteract this.",
      "We also saw early on warnings about Iran and what they are doing. The assessment Iran favors Harris, Russia favors Trump.",
      "What form of influence are we seeing?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, Iran has two main goals in this election cycle. First, to denigrate President Trump. They have expressed present - excuse me, a preference for Vice president Harris based upon Trump's record in office and their perception of what Mr. Trump would do if elected. That's objective one.",
      "Objective two is to sow discord. And they view undermining perception about thein integrity of our election as an effective tool. So, they are using influence operations to denigrate Mr. Trump and to sow discord using AI- generated content really focused in particular on, for example, allegations of voter fraud. We should expect Iran to continue increasingly sophisticated influence operations related to perceptions of a lack of election integrity. That will last well after polls close, Margaret. This is the most attenuated election security related threat environment we have likely seen in history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not about just changing votes. It's about not trusting our democracy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, 76 million Americans already voted. So, can we say those numbers show the adversaries are failing, or are the election workers you're speaking with really concerned about what's to come?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, it's - it has increased our ability to be resilient against the disinformation. The more people who vote early, they're effectively inoculated themselves against disinformation that might be inclined to be intended to help them self-suppress their vote or confuse them about how to vote. So, the fact that we've had over 76 million vote already, and that's going to increase by several million more once all the mail ballots are in, once there's even early voting going on today, still in about 27 states and D.C. So, that's very good. That means the number of people that still need to vote on Election Day, when disinformation might be very focused on them, trying to get them confused with very little time for them to be resilient against that disinformation, that's going to affect fewer voters. That's a very good thing. And I think we're seeing, especially in states like Georgia and North Carolina, well over 4 million votes in each of those states has been cast. Millions of votes in many other - of the swing states. And so far, very few problems despite efforts to create problems perhaps from our adversaries overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would point people to the secretaries of state themselves, their websites, for reliable information?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Yes. Whenever you need information, go to your state election website. That's usually the secretary of state's website. Sometimes, in North Carolina, Wisconsin, there's an election commission or an election board. Go to your local election website if you know your country or locality where elections are taking place. And if you need help, go to vote.gov. That will navigate you there eventually. Go - just rely upon those sources solely for information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, when you were in government, we did see, back in 2018, disclosure by the general at the head of then Cyber Command and the National Security Agency say that - that the government at that time set up a small group to basically knock Russia offline, to physically stop them from some of these influence operations.",
      "Can the U.S. undertake offensive operations like that now?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. I do think though that the infrastructure that the adversaries or the Russians and the Iran have put into place may not be where it once was. It has moved. Keep in mind that earlier this year the Department of Justice took offline a disinformation group that we track as Doppelganger, they took their various websites offline. And they did it in a way that was timed so that they could not rebuild those websites and reestablish the engagement with those websites in time for the election. So, there have been steps taken to ensure that the bad guys can't execute their strategies.",
      "And in the meantime, you have organizations, like SISA, that are doing more with more jurisdictions on election security than at any other point previously. So, they have a lot of confidence around the resilience of the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you said about using Americans to spread disinformation.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: People are becoming unwitting agents of a foreign adversary essentially by re-tweeting or reposting some of these fake videos.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: We have seen that, right? So, there was another Department of Justice announcement that a media outlet, based out of Tennessee, was receiving funding from the Russians, from RT, a cutout (ph) -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tenet Group.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Tenet Group.",
      "Now, to David's earlier point, that is why it is so critically important that American voters, when they're looking for information about the election, they go to their relevant local or state official. They know what's going on. Go - if you're in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger and Gabe Sterling are probably running the tightest ship when it comes to elections in the country right now. They're incredibly effective. They're out there. They're putting information in the hands of the American people so they understand what's happening.",
      "And so when Russian operations like the Haitian voters pops up, they were on it immediately and they knocked it down. That is hugely effective in maintaining trust of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, we have seen concerns about physical security, though, as well at voting locations. The Democratic governor of Washington state has activated the National Guard, put them on stand-by, citing general and specific information and concerns about violence and unrest. You did have that drop box in Vancouver that damaged hundreds of ballots. There was an incendiary device there. Are there specific plots the federal government knows of at this time?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, it is a generally heightened threat environment, both in terms of complexity and the length of time that terrorism related threats, criminal threats and influence operations by nation states will last related to the election. It is just prudent planning, Margaret, in this threat environment for officials at all levels of government, federal, state and local, to engage in detailed operational planning. State and local officials are in the lead for the security in their jurisdictions.",
      "Now, in my experience, particularly post January 6th, those operational plans must include a full sense of all available law enforcement resources. National Guard is the last resort. You have local resources, state resources and then, as necessary, National Guard, as well as a clear sense of who to call when so that there aren't communication failures.",
      "Federal officials have invested a lot of money and time in doing exercises, hundreds them with state and local officials, sharing intelligence and information, and trying to share best practices. But at the end of the day, the state and local officials are in the lead and should have clear operational plans for a range of scenarios that may arise, in particular large scale security incidents that may arise with little or no warning. We learned lessons from January 6th. And from my conversations with former colleagues, that operational planning has been underway for years, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I want to quickly get you to respond to what Senator Rubio was raising during our interview. He was talking about the charges brought by the secretary - or I mentioned the charged brought by the secretary of state against the individual he highlighted had cast a vote despite not being a citizen.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How is it that someone who's not a citizen could register and cast a ballot? How did that even happen?",
      "DAVID BECKER: Well, we have several protections in place to make sure it's very, very unlikely this is going to happen. We've seen places like Ohio, which has documented only six cases of non-citizen voting over a decade, dating back to 2014. We have places like Georgia, that has documented nine cases of non-citizen voting since 2008. So, it does happen, but it's extremely rare. And I'm sure Michigan is going to go through the process of evaluating exactly what went wrong in this one particular instance.",
      "But it's also important to note, this is one case. It was very swiftly dealt with. This individual is going to lose his administration at the University of Michigan. He's going to be prosecuted. He might go to jail. And he's almost certainly to be deported.",
      "This is a cautionary tale. It's one of the reasons we know that non-citizen voting is extremely rare. It's not zero, but it's very close to zero because the potential benefit to the person who perpetrates that crime, one vote in an election with 160 million ballots is far outweighed by the potential risk that they're facing of deportation and other jail time, et cetera.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that.",
      "I wanted you to explain the process, because I think explaining how our courts work -",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How the systems are set up to deal with these things is important.",
      "One of the things disclosed in the U.S. intelligence report put out by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was that Russia's amplifying these claims of non-citizen voting.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's what happens.",
      "DAVID BECKER: Right. That's what happens. And there are plenty of protections in place to make sure that this is extremely rare. As close to zero as it can be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. Thanks for your perspective. I know we'll keep you on speed dial throughout the week.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To dissect some of the new economic indicators we've been seeing, we're joined by Mohamed El-Erian. He is the chief economic adviser at Allianz.",
      "Welcome back to the program.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: (Chief Economic Advisor, Allianz): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, we saw on Friday this jobs report that indicated job creation stalled a bit in October. There were some complicating factors, like hurricanes and a strike at Boeing. But what's your perspective on what this indicates for the next president of the United States?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, most of the report, as you pointed out, was distorted in a really important manner by the strikes by the hurricanes. The bottom line, Margaret, is we have an economy that has been growing robustly. Inflation is coming down. And the main challenge for the next administration is not just to maintain what is called economic exceptionalism, because we're outperforming all other advanced economies, but also to continue to reposition it for the engines of tomorrow's prosperity. And that's absolutely critical.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the Federal Reserve is meeting later this week, may move on interest rates again since inflation is around or getting close to that 2 percent target. But for average people, they see housing prices are high, they see grocery prices are still high. Where's the scenario where those prices actually come down?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and that's what everybody's expecting, but it's not going to happen.",
      "Look, the good news is interest rates will continue to come down. The good news is inflation, which is the rate of increase of the cost of living will come down. But it's very hard to bring down prices. And that's one political problem is, when you tell people inflation is coming down, in their head they think prices are coming down, not the rate of increase of prices. So, it's a misunderstanding, unfortunately. But you've to be careful what you wish for, because if prices come down significantly, we are then in something much worse economically.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that misunderstanding being used quite a lot on the campaign trail, Mohamed, as you know.",
      "I know the stock market is not an indicator of what's happening with the economy, but it is forward-looking. This week what should we be expecting as a reaction to the outcome of this election?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, believe it or not, a lot of investors are just on the sideline. They see so many possibilities, be it for the presidential race, be it for Congress, or even the extent to which what is promised by presidential candidates will become policy. There stands to be a big gap between the two. So, quite a few investors have said, you know what, there's way too much uncertainty. I'm just standing on the sideline and waiting to see what emerges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A gap between what's promised and what's delivered is a very diplomatic way of putting campaigning there, Mohamed. But neither candidate is even making a gesture towards reducing the debt burden in this country. And in terms of what's being promised, the plans that the vice president has put forward is estimated by this Committee for a Responsible Budget to increase the federal debt by nearly $4 trillion through 2035. Donald Trump's plans would increase it by nearly $8 trillion.",
      "Congress, as you suggested there, they can put the brakes on anything here. But does this continued promise of spending and no promise of reducing it concern you?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It does. It does in a big way.",
      "Look, it was unthinkable that we would have almost 30 months of unemployment at 4 percent or below and we'd run fiscal deficit of six to eight percent. Remember, John Kennedy said, when the sun is shining you fix the roof. Instead, the sun has been shining on our economy and we've created more roofs. Our debt to GDP is 120 percent of - our debt is 120 percent of GDP.",
      "Look, both candidates, whether they like it or not, are going to have to find a way to moderate deficits and debt and critically, Margaret, to create operational flexibility in the budget. The budget is becoming more and more rigid, which means that it's harder to respond to unanticipated shocks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unanticipated shocks.",
      "In terms of one of the things that we have heard from the Trump campaign quite a lot is this pledge to use tariffs to create income for the government somehow. That's how Donald Trump suggests using them.",
      "Do you view tariffs as a regressive tax that will hurt poor people by raising prices for them, or do you view them as somehow, you know, a rising tide that floats all boats?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, tariffs are a dangerous tool. They have limited use, but if they are overused, they become counterproductive. It is - it is not a good idea to promise the use of tariffs to deliver all sorts of things. Be it a lower deficit, be it protecting domestic producers, be it putting pressure, leveraging influence on other countries. Tariffs have a role to play, but not to the extent - and similar for the other side. Industrial policy and regulation, they both have a role to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: But be careful of overreach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Fair point.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now for a preview of what we'll all be looking for on Tuesday is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, this is neck-and-neck. You've been telling us that for weeks now. What is it that the campaigns are focusing on and what we should be looking for?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Hey there, Margaret. So, start with this. Here is the map. The states in white are all those razor-tight battleground states. But let's get beyond the margin of error for a second and look at some of the political possibilities. And we can show you that in our polling models.",
      "Start with this, what I think is one of the key dynamics in this race. There are voters who say they did not vote in 2020 and many of them, in fact about four in ten, say that they definitely will this time. Among them, especially the men among them, are for Donald Trump. And the Trump campaign is trying to turn them out.",
      "So, we wondered, what happens if he does? And I'll show you. On this map we're going to run that scenario through our CBS models. And if he does turn out a lot of those non-voters, those men, they boost him, he would do well across the sun belt, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and flip Pennsylvania, and that would be enough to put him over the top and give him the win. That's a hypothetical, but it shows you how one of those campaign dynamics could play out.",
      "Now, on the other side, there's another important dynamic, and that is the gender gap. We've talked about it a lot. And I'll show you a slide from one of our recent polls that illustrate that. So many more women voting for Kamala Harris.",
      "Well, you've seen the Harris campaign out there trying not only to get women turnout, but also some crossover from Republicans, and in particular Republican women. So, we said, what happens if she can get those Republican numbers to match closer to what Joe Biden got in 2020, driven in large part by women and Republican women. If I put that scenario into the map here, our models show that she would hold the blue wall states across the upper Midwest, keep Georgia in her column, even flip North Carolina, and that would give her an Electoral College victory.",
      "All of this, again, hypothetical. But it puts it in political terms, some of the dynamics that could play out, and we'll be watching, on election night, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll be watching in real time as the data comes in to the desk.",
      "What is it that we should be tracking throughout the night?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, we're going to show you everything as it comes in. And the first thing I'm going to show you is where the votes are, because sometimes, and I'll pull up the 2020 map here in Georgia just as an example, you're going to see red areas, Republican, you're going to see blue areas, Democratic. But I'm always going to show, there are more people in some of these place than others. If I take this map and I rotate it, you'll - what you'll see in the example of Georgia is, the higher bars reflect more votes, and there's more voters in Atlanta and metro Atlanta. And Democrats need to do well in places like that. Really get a lot of turnout there. Whereas across rural areas, you see it's more flat on the map here. Not as many votes but Republicans very consistently kind of add to their margins there. That's one way we're going to show you the state in full.",
      "The other thing I'm going to watch is patterns, shifts from the last election to this one. Again, as an example, if I were to show you the shift that happened from 2016 to 2020, in Georgia, Democrats, Joe Biden at the time, got a lot of those counties around metro Atlanta shifting blue, those rural areas shifted red, Republicans. We'll see if something like that happens again. So it's where the votes come from, how they shift and the last thing, very quickly, Margaret, I'll remind everybody is, patience. If I were to take that same Georgia timeline and show you what it looked like at say 9:00 p.m., just after poll closed, a couple hours, you see so much uncounted votes still in Georgia, Metro Atlanta hadn't counted yet, et cetera. If this pattern comes out again on election night, we'll want to say, hold on, let's wait for all the votes to get counted before we know the winner.",
      "Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Patience is a virtue.",

    "story": [
      "Two days before Election Day, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, said she's \"very confident\" Democrats will win in her battleground state.",
      "\"I am optimistic that we are going to win, not only for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, but for Jacky Rosen in this state,\" she said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Around half of Nevada's active registered voters have cast ballots, with Republicans leading statewide, spurring anxiety among Democrats heading into Election Day. Nevada is also the only state where Republicans flipped the governor's mansion in 2022, although Cortez Masto hung onto her seat by less than 8,000 votes in that same election. But Cortez Masto said she's \"optimistic\" about Harris' chances in the Silver State, citing what she has seen as an impressive ground game and canvassing efforts from Democrats.",
      "\"That's literally what matters here, is making sure that our voters, who are paying attention now in a swing state like Nevada, that somebody is talking to them,\" Cortez Masto said. \"Now is the time for us to connect with our voters and talk to them about the issues that they care about.\"",
      "With an economy based largely around tourism and hospitality in Las Vegas, Nevada is home to a significant working class population. The Trump campaign has worked to make inroads among the voting bloc with economic policies that may be especially salient in Nevada, where the economy was among the most impacted by pandemic closures in 2020, spurring frustration with Democrat-led policies.",
      "Cortez Masto said Democrats are engaging with the working-class communities \"on the issues that matter to them,\" while touting support from organized labor. And she argued that Harris is the candidate with solutions for affordable housing and lowering health care costs, among other issues.",
      "\"That's what's relevant at the end of the day, and how we're going to make this happen,\" she said.",
      "Still, the Nevada Democrat urged that elections are \"always close\" in Nevada. And she noted that she won reelection in 2022 facing a Republican advantage \u2014 in what was the closest Senate race in the country in the midterms.",
      "Cortez Masto pointed to the state's large population of nonpartisan voters who she argued lean Democrat, saying \"they leaned my way, and so I am very, very confident that, as we are working our ground game, we're going to organize our way to victory here.\"",
      "A Republican presidential candidate hasn't won Nevada since 2004, but Democrats' margin of victory has decreased in recent years.",
      "Cortez Masto also defended President Biden after he appeared to call supporters of former President Donald Trump \"garbage,\" saying that he had clarified the remarks as being about a comedian's rhetoric at a Trump rally. And she argued that Harris, whom she worked with when they were both state attorneys general, has \"made it very clear, moving forward, that she wants to represent everyone.\"",
      "\"No matter whether you voted for her or not, and whoever you vote for, you shouldn't be criticized for that,\" Cortez Masto added.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, downplayed Trump's connection to the comedian's remarks, while arguing that \"what's more relevant\" is Mr. Biden's comment, which he argued is in line with \"what most people in the Democratic Party and hierarchy believe.\"",
      "\"If you're so confident about victory, the way the Harris people say they are, then why would you be out there attacking not Donald Trump \u2014 attacking anyone who is thinking about voting for him,\" Rubio said. \"That doesn't seem to be like the actions of a confident campaign. It seems to me like the actions of a scared one.\"",

      "If the latest ballot measures are successful in expanding abortion access, they would override stringent bans on the procedure in five states. Roughly two dozen states have enacted abortion restrictions after Roe was reversed, and 14 of those states have near-total bans with limited exceptions.",
      "Here's where abortion is on the ballot in 2024:",

      "A ballot measure, known as Proposition 139, would create a \"fundamental right\" to abortion in Arizona. Under the proposed change to the state's constitution, the state would not be able to \"interfere with this fundamental right before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible.\" Fetal viability is generally understood to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, and is defined in the ballot measure as the point when \"the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus,\" as determined by a healthcare professional.",

      "Colonial Williamsburg, capital of the British colony of Virginia, has been preserved as a sprawling museum. Its mission: that \"the future may learn from the past.\"",
      "The crown jewels of Williamsburg, Virginia, are the interpreters, interacting with audiences of our day, but in the context of the world as they would have known it in their time.",
      "By way of example, Thomas Jefferson welcomes visitors: \"Good day, friends. How are you faring? You have no complaints? You must not be Virginians! If not from Virginia, where from? Pennsylvania, land of religious anarchy? Welcome! The Ohio Territories? From terra incognito. Welcome to civilization! Upper Canada? Bonjour! Are you immigrating here? Oh, you should. We are trying to encourage immigrants to immigrate here.\"",
      "Indeed, immigration was highly controversial in Jefferson's time, but from a radically different perspective than ours. I raised the issue with Kurt Smith (who personifies Thomas Jefferson), and Katherine Pittman (a very feisty Martha Washington).",
      "\"It was there in 1776,\" said Smith, \"in the Declaration of Independence. You know that middle bit that everyone skips? In the 27 long train of abuses, Jefferson says, 'He [the king] has prevented immigration.' It is one of the reasons we declare independence.\"",
      "Pittman asked, \"And how can we improve if we never welcome anything new?\"",
      "\"We're not talking about 'never' welcoming anything new,\" Koppel said. \"We need to know who's coming. We need to know whether they are people of good character. Isn't that what the argument is about?\"",
      "\"It's the argument in your time,\" Pittman said. \"We can just speak to our time.\"",
      "\"Oh, cut it out!\"",
      "\"You started it!\" Pittman laughed.",
      "\"I'm in a pissing match with Mrs. Washington, for God's sake!\" said Koppel.",
      "\"I think I'm gonna win!\" she laughed.",
      "The interpreters are well advised to merely hint at the issues of our day. Jefferson (Smith) opined, \"How do you get a body of men to vote for something because it's the right thing to do? I don't know. Maybe your politicians do it all the time!\" The audience was amused.",
      "Visitors to Williamsburg are left to grapple with the actual political problems of 2024. One woman remarked, \"There are certain people that want all the power, like the king. They wanted the power over everybody, and I think that's what's happening now.\"",
      "One young woman said, \"This country is steeped in conflict and a fight for liberty. But I truly hope I get to live in a world where I have rights to my body.\"",
      "\"Abortion,\" asked Koppel. \"You feel strongly about that?\"",
      "\"I do,\" she replied.",
      "It's a subject on which Martha Washington also has her own views on, c. 1800. In that era, she said, the issue was dealt with from within the home: \"Birth and a woman's health is a woman's sphere,\" she said. \"One does not need to ascertain the services of a midwife if that is the course that you are wishing. These remedies are known amongst female kind. It is known in the indigenous communities. It is known in the African culture. It is known in our European cultures as well, be it different herbs, be it different techniques, in order to rid one's self of an unwanted child. But generally, they are held within the female sex. But I know that my husband, General Washington, would be in full support of whatever I wanted to do with my own person.\"",
      "An even more contentious issue, then and now, was race. In Jefferson's day, that meant slavery. Despite owning more than 600 enslaved men, women and children, Jefferson put forward legislation in 1779 to end the practice. \"But here's the problem,\" Jefferson said. \"Bill 51, making the slave trade illegal, has to be presented to a body of men, all of whom own \u2026 what?\"",
      "Williamsburg chooses to depict slavery in a particularly dramatic, and unrepresentative, fashion, in the person of James Lafayette, an enslaved man who was directed to meet with the Marquis de Lafayette, the French nobleman who served the American cause (and whose name James would ultimately adopt).",
      "Lafayette asked James to sneak across the British lines as a fake runaway slave, to ingratiate himself with the officers of the British army, and then report back what he heard. James succeeded so brilliantly that he eventually worked directly under General Lord Cornwallis. \"I could take that British intelligence and information and share it with the American side over and over again, which I did,\" James said.",
      "He faithfully served the American cause, but he said, \"I was not to be given my freedom for what I had done for American independence. I was sent back to slavery. I was sent back to Master William for six more years.\"",
      "Only after the Marquis de Lafayette petitioned the Virginia legislature for his freedom would it eventually be granted.",
      "Given that extraordinary backstory, I wondered how Stephen Seals (who interprets James) deals with taking on that role. \"You understand that so many of the issues that we deal with today are connected to many of the decisions that were made in the colonial area,\" Seals said. \"You can see the line from one to the other. And when you come to terms and you see that, I got very depressed, and I almost left. I almost quit.\"",
      "Then, a colleague reminded him he was giving a voice to ancestors denied one during their own lifetimes. \"And the moment she said that to me, I had few issues with the fact that I had to play an enslaved person every single day, because I now understood why I was doing it,\" he said. \"So, I love what I do, it's an honor doing what I do, but I live out in the middle of nowhere for a reason, because when I'm done here, I want to go and be away from it all. It's how I cope.\"",
      "Finally, there's the father of our nation, George Washington. \"When we began, I mentioned that we should avoid seeing factions arise,\" he said. \"I specifically mentioned by regional distinction, but it is just as important that we endeavor to avoid seeing factions arise by the spirit and fury of party politics.\"",
      "Asked by a visitor whom he would support in the 2024 presidential race, Washington replied, \"I'm not sure what you mean by presidential race, sir. Do you mean the election? Race? Can you imagine how lacking of any sort of virtue or dignity a race would have? We stand for elections, sir; we certainly don't run for it!\"",
      "Ron Carnegie gives a striking portrayal of the man who could have been president for life, but chose a different path. \"Very often when I'm talking to people at the end, somebody in that group will say, 'I wish President Washington was running today,'\" Carnegie said. \"There's no way a man like President Washington could be president today.\"",
      "Because? \"He is aloof, he's not friendly, he's not outgoing, he doesn't like to talk in public. And he doesn't want the job. And how are you gonna become President today if you don't want the job?\"",
      "That wasn't a problem in 1800. John Adams very much wanted to keep the job; Thomas Jefferson wanted to take it.",
      "Smith noted, \"Things are just as nasty in the 18th century as they are in the 21st. There are newspapers that called John Adams pretty awful things. And there were terrible things thrown in Jefferson's corner. There were New Englanders and New England newspapers that were certain that if Jefferson was elected president, he would personally go into their homes and steal their Bibles.\"",
      "John Adams lost that election, and conceded. \"Jefferson calls that election of 1800 the Second American Revolution,\" said Smith. \"And it was precisely because, for the first time in this country, there was a change in political party at the very top of government, and it was peaceful. It was a peaceful transfer of power. That's powerful.\"",
      "That had never happened before, but it set a precedent that lasted \u2013 until our time.",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 07:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Run for Recovery, a new program, offers a boot camp for people in recovery from substance use who dream of holding political office.",
    "story": [
      "Thomas Higdon was a politics fanatic his entire life: He kept up on the news cycle, he door-knocked for candidates, and he volunteered for a number of campaigns.",
      "He long dreamed of working in government, but he and everyone around him felt it wouldn't be possible because of his substance use. His use of alcohol and other drugs began causing problems when he was in law school in the mid-1990s, and in 2014, the consequences of his substance use left him living under an overpass. He is now abstinent from the drugs, but even years later, he felt he had ruined his chances of running for office.",
      "\"I allowed this internalized stigma, over decades, to blind me to what I could really do,\" Higdon, now 52, told CBS News.",
      "That thought stayed with him for years. He moved into grassroots organizing and advocacy spaces, but in 2023, he learned about the Recovery Advocacy Project's upcoming \"Run for Recovery\" program \u2014 and realized that working in public office might still be possible.",
      "Building a political bootcamp for people in recovery",
      "Courtney Gary-Allen, who began using drugs at a young age and overdosed multiple times before getting sober in 2015, has successfully run for office twice. In 2020, she was elected to the position of at-large City Councilor in Augusta, Maine. She was reelected to the same role in 2023. Both times, she won in a landslide, but the experience made her realize the need for a campaign bootcamp centered around people in recovery. Similar bootcamps are conducted by major political parties, but she wanted to create a bipartisan space tailored to the recovery community's specific experiences and needs.",
      "\"For the last decade or so, the recovery movement in America has been very focused on telling our stories and advocating and pushing for better policy around substance use disorder and recovery efforts, and I think this is a new chapter in the story of the recovery advocacy movement,\" said Gary-Allen, who is also the organizing director at the Maine Advocacy Recovery Project. \"We're no longer just advocating to policymakers. We are running for office to become the policymakers that are making decisions around these issues and many more.\"",
      "From that idea, Run for Recovery was born. The program graduated its inaugural class, made up of five Democrats, five Republicans, and five Independents, in August 2024. The 15 participants were selected from across the country. Once a month for a year, they met online to talk the ins and outs of mounting a campaign. Lessons ranged from learning about finance laws to drafting position statements to preparing to talk openly about their substance abuse.",
      "Higdon was one of the selected participants. Even though he had \"been around campaigns all (his) life,\" he said the Run for Recovery class educated him about the technicalities of running for office. But it wasn't just the classroom learning that inspired him. When he started the class, \"there was still that sort of nagging voice in the back of your head of 'You can't run,'\" Higdon said. The time with his classmates helped change his perspective.",
      "\"I just can't express how good it felt to be around people who also wanted to do this thing,\" Higdon said. \"There are a number of reasons why I ultimately may not run, but fear of what people will say and that stigma won't be one of them.\"",
      "Mobilize Recovery founder Ryan Hampton, who completed the Run for Recovery program and is campaigning for a seat in Nevada's state assembly, said that stigma has affected his campaign. He said his campaign has been subject to attack ads bringing up his history of substance use and calling his policy positions to a \"dangerous drug agenda.\"",
      "It's a stressful time, Hampton said, but lessons he's learned throughout his recovery journey and from the Run for Recovery program have helped him continue his campaign.",
      "\"I am certainly the underdog in this race, but I'm used to it,\" Hampton said. \"Am I afraid of losing an election? No, I have lost a lot more in my life than an election. I am not afraid of losing. I'm running to win, but I'm also running because I believe our community is yearning for something different.\"",
      "Growing a movement",
      "There's no compiled list of every single person in recovery running for office. Gary-Allen said she was aware of several people in recovery running for office in Maine. Higdon is weighing a run for a seat in Maryland's state legislature. Racquel Garcia, a Run for Recovery graduate who holds an appointed position in Colorado, is considering a campaign for a state position in 2026.",
      "Gary-Allen said she hopes to see more of the Run for Recovery program graduates start their own campaigns \u2014 and see others in recovery, even people who didn't go through the program, make the jump into politics.",
      "\"I think we're on this cusp of a revelation. Not only are people in recovery voting and showing up and advocating, we're running for office, and we're going to serve in these seats,\" Gary-Allen said. \"We're going to help create solutions to substance use across the country. I'm excited for the next couple of election seasons.\"",

      "So then how did Reeves' DNA get on the guide rod of the murder weapon? Howard believes that Reeves' DNA could only be on that guide rod if the gun was fired at her at close range.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "South Carolina put Richard Moore to death by lethal injection Friday for the 1999 fatal shooting of a convenience store clerk, despite a broad appeal for mercy by parties that included three jurors and the judge from his trial, a former prison director, pastors and the his family.",
      "Moore, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:24 p.m.",
      "TEXAS DEATH ROW INMATE'S LAWYER SAYS 'THERE WAS NO CRIME' AS SHE MAKES LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO SAVE HIS LIFE",
      "Moore was convicted of killing the Spartanburg convivence store clerk in September 1999 and sentenced to death two years later. Moore went into the store unarmed, took a gun from the victim when it was pointed at him and fatally shot him in the chest as the victim shot him with a second gun in the arm.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers asked Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life in prison without parole because of his spotless prison record and willingness to be a mentor to other inmates. They also said it would be unjust to execute someone for what could be considered self-defense and unfair that Moore, who is Black, was the only inmate on the state\u2019s death row convicted by a jury without any African Americans.",
      "But McMaster refused to grant clemency. No South Carolina governor has reduced a death sentence, and 45 executions have now been carried out since the U.S. Supreme Court allowed states to restart executions nearly 50 years ago.",
      "This photo provided by Justice 360 shows death row inmate Richard Moore at Kirkland Reception and Evaluation Center in Columbia, S.C., Aug. 17, 2018.\u00a0 (Justice 360 via AP)",
      "Unlike in previous executions, the curtain to the death chamber was open when media witnesses arrived. Moore's last words had already been read by Lindsey Vann, his lawyer of 10 years.",
      "Moore had his eyes closed and his head was pointed toward the ceiling. A prison employee announced the execution could begin at 6:01 p.m. Moore took several deep breaths that sounded like snores over the next minute. Then he took some shallow breaths until about 6:04, when his breathing stopped. Moore showed no obvious signs of discomfort.",
      "Vann cried as the employee announced the execution could start. She clutched a prayer bracelet with a cross. Sitting beside her was a spiritual advisor, his hands on his knees palms up. Vann clutched a prayer bracelet with a cross.",
      "Two members of the victims' family were also present, along with Solicitor Barry Barnette, who was on the prosecution team that convicted Moore. They all watched stoically.",
      "Afterward prison spokeswoman Chrysti Shain read his last words at a news conference.",
      "\"To the family of Mr. James Mahoney, I am deeply sorry for the pain and sorrow I caused you all,\" he said. \"To my children and granddaughters, I love you and am so proud of you. Thank you for the joy you have brought to my life. To all of my family and friends, new and old, thank you for your love and support.\"",
      "His final meal was steak cooked medium, fried catfish and shrimp, scalloped potatoes, green peas, broccoli with cheese, sweet potato pie, German chocolate cake and grape juice.",
      "Three jurors who condemned Moore to death in 2001, including one who wrote Friday, sent letters asking McMaster to change his sentence to life without parole. They were joined by a former state prison director, Moore's trial judge, his son and daughter, a half-dozen childhood friends and several pastors.",
      "They all said Moore, 59, was a changed man who loved God, doted on his new grandchildren the best he could, helped guards keep the peace and mentored other prisoners after his addiction to drugs clouded his judgment and led to the shootout in which James Mahoney was killed, according to the clemency petition.",
      "Moore previously had two execution dates postponed as the state sorted through issues that created a 13-year pause in the death penalty, including companies' refusal to sell the state lethal injection drugs, a hurdle that was solved by passing a secrecy law.",
      "Moore is the second inmate executed in South Carolina since it resumed executions. Four more are out of appeals and the state appears ready to put them to death in five-week intervals through the spring. There are now 30 people on death row.",
      "The governor said before the execution that he would carefully reviewing everything sent by Moore's lawyers and, as is customary, would wait until minutes before the execution starts to announce his decision once he hears by phone that all appeals are finished.",
      "\"Clemency is a matter of grace, a matter of mercy. There is no standard. There is no real law on it,\" McMaster told reporters Thursday.",
      "In an interview for a video that accompanied his clemency petition, Moore expressed remorse for the killing of Mahoney.",
      "\"This is definitely part of my life I wish I could change. I took a life. I took someone\u2019s life. I broke the family of the deceased,\" Moore said. \"I pray for the forgiveness of that particular family.\"",
      "Prosecutors and Mahoney's relatives have not spoken publicly in the weeks leading up to the execution. In the past, family members have said they suffered deeply and want justice to be served.",
      "Moore\u2019s lawyers said his original attorneys did not analyze the crime scene carefully and left unchallenged prosecutors' contention that Moore, who came into the store unarmed, fired at a customer and that his intention from the start was a robbery.",
      "According to their account, the clerk pulled a gun on Moore after the two argued because he was 12 cents short for what he wanted to buy.",
      "Moore said he wrestled the gun from Mahoney's hand and the clerk pulled a second weapon. Moore was shot in the arm and fired back, hitting Mahoney in the chest. Moore then went behind the counter and stole about $1,400.",
      "No one else on South Carolina\u2019s death row started their crime unarmed and with no intention to kill, Moore\u2019s current attorneys say.",
      "Jon Ozmint, a former prosecutor who was director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections from 2003 to 2011 and who added his voice to those seeking clemency, said Moore's case was not the worst-of-the-worst kind of crime that would usually prompt a death penalty case.",
      "There are plenty of people who were not sentenced to death but committed much more heinous crimes, Ozmint said, citing the example of Todd Kohlhepp, who was given a life sentence after pleading guilty to killing seven people including a woman he raped and tortured for days.",
      "Lawyers for Moore, who is Black, also said his trial was not fair. There were no African Americans on the jury even though 20% of Spartanburg County residents were Black.",
