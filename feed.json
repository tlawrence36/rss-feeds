      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Beach Boys' Mike Love was inducted into the 2025 Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night, just one day after it was announced that his inimitable bandmate Brian Wilson had died.",
      "The actor \u2014 and lifelong Beach Boys fan \u2014 John Stamos introduced him. \u201cThere are songs that don't just play on the radio,\u201d Stamos said in his speech. \u201cMike Love is a songwriter's songwriter.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat an incredible honor this is,\u201d Clinton said in his speech. He talked about his early days in the legendary Brill Building song factory, which he described like going \u201cinto Oz.\u201d Being a songwriter, to him, required \u201cconsistent effort.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up chasing fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up chasing feeling ... Creativity has no limitations.\u201d",
      "His four children, R.J., Heavenly, Hannah Joy and Royal Jerkins, performed one of his best-known hits, Brandy and Monica's \u201cThe Boy Is Mine.\"",

      "When Gorley took the stage for his speech, he said he felt like he was in a \u201cfever dream\u201d or that he has \u201ccrashed a royal wedding.\u201d",
      "Legendary English songwriter Tony Macaulay was also honored. He is best known for such classics as The Foundations\u2019 \u201cBaby Now That I\u2019ve Found You\" and \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup,\u201d the latter of which was performed for Macaulay by a spirited Debbie Gibson.",

      "Gracie Abrams received the eminent Hal David Starlight Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s inductees included Steely Dan, R.E.M., Timbaland, Hillary Lindsey and Dean Pitchford. At the induction ceremony last summer, R.E.M. stunned attendees by reuniting for an acoustic version of their alt-rock hit, \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honor those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song. Some already in the hall include Gloria Estefan, Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bill Withers, Neil Diamond and Phil Collins.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",

      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",

      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country\u2019s most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died",
      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",

      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",

Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",

      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",

      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",

      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",

      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",

      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF.

      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",

They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws.

      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",

      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",

      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",

      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",
      "A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.",

      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "Kansas has a total of 76 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but two of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.",
      "Montana had 20 measles cases as of Tuesday. Twelve were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up \u2014 Montana\u2019s first in 35 years.",
      "Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.",
      "There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.",
      "North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.",
      "There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.",
      "Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.",
      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats known as \u201cVoyagers\u201d have been put into service by the Danish Armed Forces for a three-month operational trial",
      "KOGE MARINA, Denmark -- From a distance they look almost like ordinary sailboats, their sails emblazoned with the red-and-white flag of Denmark.",
      "But these 10-meter-long (30-foot-long) vessels carry no crew and are designed for surveillance.",
      "Four uncrewed robotic sailboats, known as \u201cVoyagers,\u201d have been put into service by Denmark's armed forces for a three-month operational trial.",
      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",
      "Their launch comes after two others already joined a NATO patrol on June 6.",
      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",
      "The Danish Defense Ministry says the trial is aimed at boosting surveillance capacity in under-monitored waters, especially around critical undersea infrastructure such as fiber-optic cables and power lines.",
      "\u201cThe security situation in the Baltic is tense,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Kim J\u00f8rgensen, the director of Danish National Armaments at the ministry. \u201cThey\u2019re going to cruise Danish waters, and then later they\u2019re going to join up with the two that are on (the) NATO exercise. And then they\u2019ll move from area to area within the Danish waters.\"",
      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",
      "The trial also unfolds against a backdrop of trans-Atlantic friction \u2014 with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatening to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a NATO ally. Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military force to take Greenland.",
      "Jenkins, the founder of Saildrone, noted that his company had already planned to open its operation in Denmark before Trump was reelected. He didn't want to comment on the Greenland matter, insisting the company isn't political.",
      "Some of the maritime disruptions have been blamed on Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet \u2014 aging oil tankers operating under opaque ownership to avoid sanctions. One such vessel, the Eagle S, was seized by Finnish police in December for allegedly damaging a power cable between Finland and Estonia with its anchor.",
      "Amid these concerns, NATO is moving to build a layered maritime surveillance system combining uncrewed surface vehicles like the Voyagers with traditional naval ships, satellites and seabed sensors.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is that you basically need to be on the water all the time, and it\u2019s humongously expensive,\" said Peter Viggo Jakobsen of the Royal Danish Defence College. \u201cIt\u2019s simply too expensive for us to have a warship trailing every single Russian ship, be it a warship or a civilian freighter of some kind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to put together a layered system that will enable us to keep constant monitoring of potential threats, but at a much cheaper level than before,\u201d he added.",

      "IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said that the radiation poses a significant danger if uranium is inhaled or ingested. He added that the risk can be effectively managed with appropriate protective measures, such as using respiratory protection devices while inside the facilities.",
      "\u201cThe level of radioactivity outside the Natanz site has remained unchanged and at normal levels, indicating no external radiological impact to the population or the environment from this event,\u201d Grossi said.",
      "Grossi was addressing an urgent session of the U.N. nuclear watchdog board in Vienna that was convened at the request of Russia to discuss Israeli attacks against Iranian nuclear facilities. He said there apparently was no additional damage at Natanz and the Isfahan nuclear research site since Saturday.",
      "He said that the main concern inside the Natanz facility is the chemical toxicity of a gas called uranium hexafluoride, which is the result of fluorine mixed with the uranium during enrichment. It is extremely volatile, will quickly corrode, can burn the skin and is especially deadly if inhaled, experts say.",
      "\u201cAmid theses challenging and complex circumstances, it is crucial that the IAEA receives timely and regular technical information about the facilities and their respective sites,\u201d Grossi said.",
      "Without information, the U.N. nuclear watchdog \u201ccannot accurately assess the radiological conditions and potential impacts on the population and the environment and cannot provide the necessary assistance.\u201d",
      "Grossi said that U.N. inspectors will remain present in Iran and inspect the nuclear facilities \u201cas soon as safety conditions allow.\u201d",

      "Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show extensive damage at Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. The images captured Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility.",

      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The IAEA said four critical buildings were damaged, including an uranium-conversion facility, but there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "Grossi on Monday also told the IAEA board of governors that no damage has been seen at the site of the Fordo enrichment site, which is buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries. Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, remained shuttered most of Monday when staff went on strike in frustration over what they called unmanageable crowds at an institution crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the \u20ac700\u2013800 million million renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "A German court has sentenced a Syrian doctor to life imprisonment for torture and war crimes in his homeland for killing two people and torturing nine in Syria between 2011 and 2012",
      "BERLIN -- A German court sentenced a Syrian doctor to life imprisonment for torture and war crimes in his Syrian homeland on Monday for killing two people and torturing nine in Syria between 2011 and 2012.",
      "The Frankfurt Higher Regional Court also established the particular gravity of the guilt, which in practice virtually rules out early release after 15 years \u2014 as is often the case in Germany when people are sentenced to life imprisonment. The 40-year-old Syrian, who was identified as Alaa M. in line with German privacy rules, was placed in preventive detention, German news agency dpa reported.",
      "In his verdict, presiding judge Christoph Koller described the actions of the accused in the military hospital in the Syrian city of Homs in the early stages of the civil war that began in 2011. He said the doctor had sadistic tendencies and acted them out during the torture.",
      "\u201cAbove all, the accused enjoyed harming people that seemed inferior and low-value to him,\u201d Koller said, according to dpa.",
      "During the trial, which lasted almost three and a half years, victims had described the most severe abuse, including beatings, kicks and the setting of wounds and body parts on fire, dpa reported.",
      "Koller emphasized that without the willingness and courage of witnesses to share the details of their suffering the facts of the case could not have been clarified.",
      "M. had lived in Germany for ten years and had worked as an orthopedic surgeon in several clinics, most recently in Bad Wildungen in northern Hesse. In summer 2020, he was arrested after some of his victims had recognized him from a TV documentary about Homs, dpa reported.",
      "The doctor supposedly tortured prisoners who were considered part of the opposition to former Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. The trial against him began in January 2022.",
      "Alaa M. described himself as not guilty during the trial, alleging that he was the victim of a conspiracy, dpa wrote. The verdict is not yet final.",

      "An armed confrontation at the border on May 28 left one Cambodian soldier dead. The incident, which each side blamed on the other, reportedly took place in a relatively small \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d along their border that both countries claim as their own.",
      "Cambodian and Thai authorities have engaged in saber-rattling since last week, and continue to implement or threaten measures short of armed force, keeping tensions high. Thailand has added restrictions at border crossings, and Cambodia has banned Thai movies and TV shows and implemented a boycott of the neighboring country\u2019s international internet links.",
      "Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen, the former prime minister, said in a televised speech Monday that the ban on Thai fruits and vegetables would take effect if Thailand doesn\u2019t lift the border restrictions by Tuesday.",
      "Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra later said Thailand decided to impose the border restrictions out of safety concerns for the citizens of both countries due to the heavier presence of armed forces along the areas. She also said any \u201cunprofessional communication\u201d that was conveyed outside a bilateral mechanism would only hurt the interests of both sides.",
      "Officials of the two countries met over the weekend in Cambodia\u2019s capital, Phnom Penh, on the conflicting territorial claims that led to last month\u2019s deadly confrontation. While both sides said the meeting was held in a good atmosphere, it appears no major breakthrough was achieved to resolve the current spat.",
      "Cambodia on Sunday said it has officially submitted a request to the U.N.\u2019s International Court of Justice, seeking a resolution to the ongoing border disputes with Thailand in four areas. The Cambodia\u2019s State Secretariat of Border Affairs said after the weekend meetings concluded that Cambodia would no longer discuss these areas under the bilateral mechanism of the two countries.",

      "Both however agreed to participate in the next round of meetings on border issues to be hosted by Thailand in September.",
      "Much of their war of words has appeared intended to mollify nationalistic critics on both sides of the border. In Thailand, the elected government of Prime Minister Paetongtarn has been attacked by right-wing nationalists who are longtime foes of her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
      "There is a long history to the territorial disputes between the two countries. Thailand is still rankled by a 1962 ICJ ruling that awarded Cambodia the disputed territory where the historic Preah Vihear temple stands. There were sporadic though serious clashes there in 2011. The ruling was reaffirmed in 2013.",

      "From the ground, looking upwards, the sight of the Air India plane's tail cone hanging from the burning building propelled Chaudhary and fellow medical students into action.",
      "\u201cThere was fire and many were injured,\u201d said Chaudhary.",
      "He said he felt lucky to survive but knew he had a task at hand. He rushed to the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit, where the injured, most of whom had burns, were wheeled in on stretchers.",
      "\u201cI felt that as a doctor I could save someone\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cI was safe. So I thought, whatever I can do, I should.\u201d",

      "Many believe that the death toll would have been higher if it had not been for the intervention of the trainee doctors and students who emerged from the smouldering hostel and rushed to save their colleagues.",
      "Akshay Zala, a senior medical student, said the crash felt \u201clike an earthquake.\u201d",
      "\u201cI could hardly see anything as thick plumes of smoke and dust engulfed everything. I was barely able to breathe,\u201d he said.",
      "Zala rushed to safety, running through dust and smoke. He cleaned and bandaged a wound on his left leg then joined others at the medical college\u2019s trauma center to treat the injured.",

      "College dean Minakshi Parikh said that many of the doctors who pulled their colleagues out of the debris, later that day went back to their duties to save as many lives as they could. \u201cThey did that and that spirit has continued till this moment,\u201d Parikh said.",
      "Images of the hostel\u2019s dining area shortly after the crash showed parts of the aircraft and pieces of luggage strewn on the floor. Dining plates still containing food lay on the few dusty tables that were left intact by the impact.",
      "\u201cSo that is human nature, isn\u2019t it? When our own people are injured, our first response is to help them,\" Parikh said. \"So the doctors who managed to escape ... the first thing that they did was they went back in and dug out their colleagues who were trapped inside.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 3,000 white crosses on a hill in South Africa are a memorial to white people killed on farms over the last three decades",
      "MOKOPANE, South Africa -- The white crosses are staked in the ground on an otherwise barren hillside on the edge of a farm, each one standing as a reminder of a terrible story of a person being killed.",
      "But the crosses, nearly 3,000 of them, do not tell the full story of South Africa's farm killings.",
      "The Witkruis Monument \u2014 which means White Cross Monument in the language spoken by South Africa's white Afrikaner minority \u2014 is a memorial only to white people who were killed on farms over the last three decades. It's a visceral snapshot seized on by some South Africans to drive a discredited narrative that white farmers in the majority Black country are being targeted in a widespread, race-based system of persecution.",
      "The false narrative has also been spread by conservative commentators in the United States and elsewhere \u2014 and amplified by South African-born Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump escalated the rhetoric, using the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe violence against white farmers.",
      "The South African government and experts who have studied farm killings have publicly denounced the misinformation spread by Trump and others. Even the caretaker of Witkruis says the monument \u2014 which makes no reference to the hundreds of Black South African farmers and farmworkers who have been killed \u2014 does not tell the complete story.",
      "The killings of farmers and farmworkers, regardless of race, are a tiny percentage of the country's high level of crime, and they typically occur during armed robberies, according to available statistics and two studies carried out over the last 25 years.",
      "Yet because wealthier white people own 72% of South Africa's privately owned farms, according to census data, they are disproportionately affected by these often brutal crimes. Black people own just 4% of the country\u2019s privately owned farmland, and the rest is owned by people who are mixed race or of Indian heritage.",
      "Misinformation about farm killings has been fueled by right-wing political groups in South Africa and others outside the country, said Gareth Newman, a crime expert at the Institute for Security Studies think tank in Pretoria.",
      "Some of the fringe South African groups, which hold no official power, boycotted the country\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, when South Africa's apartheid system of white minority rule officially ended. They have espoused a debunked theory of persecution \u2014 in a country where whites make up about 7% of the population \u2014 ever since.",
      "\u201cThey held on to these beliefs as a way of maintaining social cohesion in their groups, making sure that they can obtain funding and support,\" Newman said. \"And they were getting support from right-wing groups abroad because it fit their narrative.\"",
      "The Witkruis Monument was started in 2004 but recognizes victims going back to 1994.",
      "Each year, more crosses are planted to memorialize white farmers and their family members who were killed, organizers say. Recently, they've planted around 50 crosses a year.",
      "Kobus de Lange, a local Afrikaner farmer, has taken on the role of caretaker of Witkruis. He gave The Associated Press access to see the memorial, bringing along his wife and children to help tidy up the monument in the country's north, near the town of Mokopane.",
      "De Lange expressed the fear and frustration of a white farming community that feels authorities have not done enough to protect them. One of his sons wore a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cenough is enough\u201d \u2014 written in their Afrikaans language \u2014 in reference to the killings.",
      "But de Lange acknowledged that the memorial does not capture the full scope of farm killings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s across the board, there are Black farmers who are also attacked,\u201d de Lange said. He said in some farm attacks, Black farmworkers are tortured by criminals for information on how to break into the main farmhouse.",
      "The Witkruis Monument would be willing to put up crosses to Black farmers and farmworkers who have been killed, but their relatives haven't requested it, he said.",
      "The monument includes memorabilia bearing the flags of conservative Afrikaner movements, symbols that are generally frowned upon because Afrikaners were at the heart of the apartheid government.",
      "From April 2023 through March 2024, there were 49 farm killings recorded by AfriForum, a white Afrikaner lobby group. That's about 0.2% of overall murders tallied by the government over the same period. The group recorded 296 farm robberies in that timeframe, or about 0.7% of all robberies.",
      "AfriForum's numbers don't include killings of Black farmers and workers, and the country\u2019s official crime statistics are not broken down by race.",
      "Black people make up more than 80% of South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million, and most victims of violent crime across South Africa are Black. But there is no public relations campaign to raise awareness about the killing of Black farmers.",
      "Across racial lines, most public outcry about crime in South Africa is over the high rates of rape and murder of women and children, which mostly takes place in cities and townships.",
      "To tamp down misinformation, South African police last month took the unprecedented step of providing a racial breakdown of farm killings during the first three months of the year. Between January and March, there were six murders on farms, down from 12 during the same period last year. One of the victims was white, the rest were Black.",
      "\u201cWhat Donald Trump is saying about whites being targeted does not exist,\" said MmaNtuli Buthelezi, who lives on a farm in Normandien, a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal province.",
      "Black farmworkers also feel vulnerable, Buthelezi said. \"We don\u2019t even have small firearms. Our weapons are just a spear and a shield, and sticks we get from the woods.\u201d",
      "Nomandien is an area where the farming community planted white crosses to raise awareness about farm killings in 2020. During a White House visit last month by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Trump showed a video in which he incorrectly referred to the location as a \u201cburial site\u201d of slain white farmers.",
      "Also, and without evidence, Trump has accused South Africa's Black-led government of \u201cfueling\u201d what he said was racially motivated violence against whites. In February, Trump issued an executive order punishing the country by banning all U.S. aid and assistance to South Africa.",
      "The Trump administration has cited a chant used by a minority Black-led political party in South Africa that has the lyrics \u201cshoot the farmer\u201d as contributing to what it claims is the racially motivated killings of white farmers. Violent crimes against farmers were a problem for years before the apartheid-era chant was revived.",
      "The South African government investigated farm killings in 2003. It interviewed dozens of police detectives and other experts and concluded that robbery was the most common motive for violent crimes, including murders, that occurred on farms. A study by the South African Human Rights Commission in 2015 reached a similar conclusion.",
      "\u201cIt is criminal individuals and groups that are targeting them because they are considered vulnerable,\u201d said Newham, who has researched the subject for more than 15 years. \u201cThey have things like cars, guns and laptops.\u201d",
      "In some cases, perpetrators are former laborers who return to attack, kill and rob farm owners to settle disputes over money. In others, disgruntled former employees had returned simply for revenge, according to historical records of the National Prosecuting Authority.",

      "KANANASKIS, Alberta -- When U.S. President Donald Trump last came to Canada for a Group of Seven summit, the enduring image was of him seated with his arms folded defiantly as then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel stared daggers at him.",
      "If there is a shared mission at this year\u2019s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, it is a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions.",
      "The 2018 summit ended with Trump assailing his Canadian hosts on social media as he departed on Air Force One, saying he had instructed the U.S. officials who remained in Quebec to oppose the G7 joint statement endorsed by the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and, of course, Canada.",
      "\u201cI have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\u201d Trump posted on the site then known as Twitter.",
      "This time, Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China's continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains.",
      "Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to have to pay.' But I think we'll have a few, few new trade deals.\"",
      "At stake might be the survival of the G7 itself at a time when the Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether the president will attend the November Group of 20 summit in South Africa.",
      "What Trump opposed at the 2018 summit in Quebec wasn't just tariffs, but a focus on having alliances with a shared set of standards seeking to shape policies.",
      "\u201cThe big dispute in Quebec were the references to the rules-based international order and that\u2019s where that famous photo comes from,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s counselor at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and a veteran of six G7 summits. \u201cI think it gave everyone the idea that G7s were maybe not business as usual.\u201d",
      "The German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments have each signaled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can reduce the likelihood of outbursts.",
      "\u201cWell, I have got a good relationship with President Trump, and that\u2019s important,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday as he flew to Canada.",
      "There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump's team for the G7 in Trump's first term.",
      "The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers' meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems.",
      "The G7 even briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation.",
      "Trump will have at least three scheduled bilateral meetings during the summit with other world leaders while in Canada, staring on Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. president is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to an administration official.",
      "The U.S. president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos, all of which have disproportionately hit Japan. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.",
      "The United Kingdom reached a trade framework with the U.S. that included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump's first term.",
      "The Trump administration has insisted that its broad tariffs will produce trade agreements that box out China, though it's unclear how antagonizing trade partners would make them want to strengthen their reliance on the U.S. Carney, the Canadian leader, has been outspoken in saying his country can no longer look to the U.S. as an enduring friend.",
      "That might leave Trump with the awkward task of wanting to keep his tariffs in place while also trying to convince other countries that they're better off siding with the U.S. than China.",
      "\u201cTrump will try to coordinate the group against China\u2019s economic coercion,\u201d Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis. \u201cBut the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren\u2019t imposing tariffs on his allies.\u201d",

      "Iran has launched a new wave of missile attacks on Israel, triggering air raid sirens across the country as emergency services reported at least five killed and dozens more wounded in the fourth day of open warfare between the regional foes",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Iran fired a new wave of missile attacks on Israel early Monday, triggering air raid sirens across the country as emergency services reported at least five killed and dozens more wounded in the fourth day of open warfare between the regional foes that showed no sign of slowing.",
      "One missile fell near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, and its concussion caused minor damage, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said on X. There were no injuries to American personnel.",
      "Iran announced it had launched some 100 missiles and vowed further retaliation for Israel's sweeping attacks on its military and nuclear infrastructure, which have killed at least 224 people in the country since last Friday.",
      "The attacks raised Israel\u2019s total death toll to at least 18, and in response the Israeli military said fighter jets had struck 10 command centers in Tehran belonging to Iran's Quds Force, an elite arm of its Revolutionary Guard that conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran.",
      "Powerful explosions, likely from Israel\u2019s defense systems intercepting Iranian missiles, rocked Tel Aviv shortly before dawn on Monday, sending plumes of black smoke into the sky over the coastal city.",
      "Authorities in the central Israeli city of Petah Tikva said that Iranian missiles had hit a residential building there, charring concrete walls, shattering windows and ripping the walls off multiple apartments.",
      "The Israeli Magen David Adom emergency service reported that two women and two men \u2014 all in their 70s \u2014 and one other person were killed in the wave of missile attacks that struck four sites in central Israel.",
      "\u201cWe clearly see that our civilians are being targeted,\u201d said Israeli police spokesman Dean Elsdunne outside the bombed-out building in Petah Tikva. \u201cAnd this is just one scene. We have other sites like this near the coast, in the south.\u201d",
      "Petah Tikva resident Yoram Suki rushed with his family to a shelter after hearing an air raid alert, and emerged after it was over to find his apartment destroyed.",
      "\u201cThank God we were OK,\u201d the 60-year-old said.",
      "Despite losing his home, he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to keep up the attacks on Iran.",
      "\u201cIt's totally worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is for the sake of our children and grandchildren.\u201d",
      "In addition to those killed, the MDA said paramedics had evacuated another 87 wounded people to hospitals, including a 30-year-old woman in serious condition, while rescuers were still searching for residents trapped beneath the rubble of their homes.",
      "\u201cWhen we arrived at the scene of the rocket strike, we saw massive destruction,\u201d said Dr. Gal Rosen, a paramedic with MDA who said he had rescued a 4-day-old baby as fires blazed from the building.",
      "During an earlier barrage of Iranian missiles on central Israel on Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said that Iran will stop its strikes if Israel does the same.",
      "But after a day of intensive Israeli aerial attacks that extended targets beyond military installations to hit oil refineries and government buildings, the Revolutionary Guard struck a hard line on Monday, vowing that further rounds of strikes would be \u201cmore forceful, severe, precise and destructive than previous ones.\"",
      "Health authorities also reported that 1,277 were wounded in Iran, without distinguishing between military officials and civilians.",
      "Rights groups, like the Washington-based Iranian advocacy group called Human Rights Activists, have suggested that the Iranian government\u2019s death toll is a significant undercount. Human Rights Activists says it has documented more than 400 people killed, among them 197 civilians.",
      "Israel argues that its assault on Iran's top military leaders, uranium enrichment sites and nuclear scientists was necessary to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "Iran has always insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not pursued a nuclear weapon since 2003.",
      "But Iran has enriched ever-larger stockpiles of uranium to near weapons-grade levels in recent years and was believed to have the capacity to develop multiple weapons within months if it chose to do so.",

      "President Donald Trump would have unique influence over the operations of U.S. Steel under the terms of the investment being made by Nippon Steel",
      "CALGARY, Alberta -- President Donald Trump would have unique influence over the operations of U.S. Steel under the terms of what the White House calls an \u201cinvestment\u201d being made by Japan-based Nippon Steel in the iconic American steelmaker.",
      "Administration officials over the past few days provided additional insight into the \u201cgolden share\u201d arrangement that the federal government made as a condition for supporting the deal.",
      "The Pittsburgh-based steel maker and Nippon Steel plan $11 billion in new investments by 2028 after indicating that they plan to move forward with the deal under the terms of a national security agreement that has the White House's approval.",
      "The White House has described the deal as a \u201cpartnership\u201d and an \u201cinvestment\u201d by Nippon Steel in U.S. Steel, although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary in a nearly $15 billion offer it originally made in late 2023.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on social media on Saturday how the \u201cgolden share\u201d to be held by the president would operate, revealing that the White House is willing to insert itself aggressively into a private company's affairs even as it has simultaneously pledged to strip away government regulations so businesses can expand.",
      "Under the government's terms, it would be impossible without Trump's consent to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, change the name of the company, \u201ctransfer production or jobs outside the United States,\u201d shutter factories, or reincorporate the business overseas, among other powers held by the president.",
      "Lutnick also said it would require presidential approval to reduce or delay $14 billion in planned investments.",
      "\u201cThe Golden Share held by the United States in U.S. Steel has powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel, and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel,\u201d Lutnick posted on X.",
      "That $14 billion figure is higher than what the companies disclosed on Friday when Trump created a pathway for the investment with an executive order based on the terms of the national security agreement being accepted.",
      "Lawmakers from Pennsylvania say the higher figure includes the cost of an electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that Nippon Steel wants to build in the U.S., bringing the value of the deal to at least $28 billion.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board\u2019s independent three directors and veto power over the other two choices, according to a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Details of the agreement emerged as Trump was traveling to Alberta in Canada for the Group of Seven summit.",
      "Still, the full terms remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel or the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Sunday, the United Steelworkers, the labor union representing U.S. Steel employees, posted a letter raising questions about the deal forged by Trump, who during his run for the presidency had pledged to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.",
      "The union said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Trump \u201chas reversed course\u201d and raised basic questions about the ownership structure of U.S. Steel.",
      "\u201cNeither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\u201d the letter said. \u201cOur labor agreement expires next year, on September 1, 2026, and the USW and its members are prepared to engage the new owners\" of U.S. Steel \"to obtain a fair contract.\u201d",
      "If Trump has as much control of U.S. Steel as he has claimed, that could put him in the delicate position of negotiating the salary and benefits of unionized steelworkers going into midterm elections.",
      "As president, Joe Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "After he was elected, Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That's when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel made a series of commitments.",
      "It gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest in U.S. Steel, promised to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \"I am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\"",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2013 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage, and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2013 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller between 2002 and 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women's rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6.",

      "According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, Saudi authorities maintained that Al-Jasser was behind a social media account on X, formerly Twitter, that levied corruption allegations against Saudi royals. Al-Jasser was also said to have posted several controversial tweets about militants and militant groups.",
      "CPJ's program director Carlos Mart\u00ednez de la Serna condemned the execution and said the lack of accountability in the wake of the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in 2018 allows for continued persecution of journalists in the kingdom.",
      "\u201cThe international community\u2019s failure to deliver justice for Jamal Khashoggi did not just betray one journalist,\u201d he said, adding it had \u201cemboldened de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to continue his persecution of the press.\u201d",

In 2024, executions in Saudi Arabia rose to 330, according to activists and human rights groups, as the kingdom continues to tightly clamp down on dissent.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",

      "The tariffs wars involving global economic powerhouses such as the U.S. and China are being felt even in such distinctly local places as your regional amusement park",
      "NEW YORK -- The trade disputes involving global economic powerhouses such as the U.S. and China are being felt even in such distinctly local places as your regional amusement park.",
      "Families who balk at the cost of a summer vacation at big amusement parks like Disney World favor trips to regional parks, which typically are within driving distance, so expensive flights aren\u2019t necessary. But if tariffs lead to economic uncertainty, they may just stay home.",
      "For park owners, tariffs could subject them to extra costs that their customers might not think about. Parts of the rides are made of imported steel that\u2019s currently subject to tariffs. Those prizes and toys people win after they shoot basketballs into a hoop? They usually come from China, which has been subject to varying tariffs.",
      "So far this year, however, there\u2019s been no letdown.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had good crowds, and everyone seems excited to be here,\u201d said Brian Hartley, vice president of Playland\u2019s Castaway Cove, in Ocean City, New Jersey, which boasts 30 rides, miniature golf, go-karts, and other beachfront attractions. \u201cAs long as the weather is good, they\u2019re ready to come down.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s true for park-goer Chris Del Borrello, at Castaway Cove on a bustling June Friday evening with a group of 10 family members, including his four children.",
      "\u201cWe come here every year because it\u2019s so fun, and we build memories every single summer,\u201d he said.",
      "Tariffs loom over the summer tourism industry just as leisure travel is expected to finally get back to prepandemic levels. The U.S. Travel Association expects Americans to take 1.96 billion trips expected this year, up 2% from 1.92 billion last year. Travel spending is also expected to increase 2% year over year.",
      "As park operators prepared for the 2025 summer last year, President Donald Trump unrolled on-again, off-again tariffs against U.S. trade partners that made planning difficult. For instance, proposed tariffs against China started at 10% in February, rose to 20% in March, ballooned to 145% in April, and were reduced to 30% in May. On Wednesday, the Trump administration put the number at 55%.",
      "Hartley said he ordered items like stuffed animals for games from China early to beat the tariffs \u2013 and benefitted from the pause announced in May.",
      "\u201cWe loaded up, we\u2019re tripping over stuff at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to purchase as much stuff as we could to be ready for the season, because that little bit makes a big difference in the bottom line at the end of the day,\u201d he said.",
      "In particular, the park added two new rides this year, but parts were delivered back in the fall.",
      "Not all parks were as fortunate. At Adventureland, in Farmingdale, N.Y., the steel structure for a new ride, Wave Twister, and some China-made game prizes like plush toys and basketballs were affected by tariff costs, said manager Jeanine Gentile.",
      "\u201cWe ordered them months ago before the tariffs were in place, but they typically arrive for delivery at this time of the year, and so obviously the tariffs were in before we received the product,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did have to pay additional for those tariffs in order to get the product.\u201d",
      "So far, the park is absorbing the cost \u2013 they made the decision not to raise ticket prices this year. But that could change next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just sort of felt that if we can do this (not raise prices) for Long Island and for our guests let\u2019s do it, where we can afford it, at least for this season,\u201d said Gentile.",
      "Aside from tariffs, economic uncertainty is the biggest challenge for amusement parks this season.",
      "At Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which is co-owned by country legend Dolly Parton and Herschend Family Entertainment, Director of Communications Pete Owens said they decided to open a week later in March due to concerns about the economy. But so far, attendance at the park, nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains, is up 4% from last year. Attendees are spending but looking for deals.",
      "A promotion giving discount tickets to public employees has proved popular. And Owens is seeing customers purchase tickets for their family closer to their actual visit instead of several days or weeks in advance. Some are even waiting until they\u2019re in the Great Smoky Mountains to decide to buy a ticket.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re all still looking very closely to see what value pricing there is or what opportunities there are,\u201d he said.",
      "The same holds true at Silver Dollar City near Branson, Missouri, an 1880s Western-themed park, which draws its visitors from what president Brad Thomas calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s heartland,\u201d an \u201coval\u201d in the middle of the country, including Minneapolis, Denver and Memphis and Houston, Texas.",
      "\u201cWhat those families tend to say as they visit us is that they want their families just to escape, even though there\u2019s a lot of concerns in every family\u2019s life, they\u2019re all dealing with time pressure and money pressure and inflation pressure and all kinds of other things,\u201d said Thomas.",
      "He said this year families coming to the park are sticking to a plan, moneywise.",
      "\u201cThey have carved the money that they\u2019ll spend in their day with us or their days with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve planned that into their budget.\u201d",
      "Back at Castaway Cove, Hartley said that while the season is going well, he worries about the mood of the consumer as economic uncertainty persists. That could affect trip planning later in the summer.",
      "\u201cPeople that really haven\u2019t already booked a vacation \u2026 it may affect, do they come down here for a weekend? Do they not? Do they come for two days instead of four or five days?\u201d he said. \u201cI think people don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s prime minister says his country will step up its defense ties with Cyprus through collaboration between the two countries\u2019 respective defense industries",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- India will step up its defense ties with Cyprus through collaboration between the two countries\u2019 respective defense industries, the Indian prime minister said Monday.",
      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn\u2019t offer details, but he said talks would begin on boosting bilateral maritime and cybersecurity cooperation.",
      "He said after talks with Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides that the two countries would also set up an information exchange mechanism geared toward combatting the threat of terrorism.",
      "Modi\u2019s two-day visit to Cyprus, ahead of his trip to Canada for the G7 summit, is the first by an Indian prime minister in more than two decades.",
      "In a joint declaration, the two countries also pledged to expand maritime cooperation through more frequent Indian navy calls to Cypriot ports and looking at enhancing joint maritime training and search and rescue operations.",
      "Modi underscored the role of the envisioned India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) as a means to usher peace and prosperity in the Middle East.",
      "Cyprus figures to act as the linchpin between India, the Middle East and Europe in the trade, energy and digital connectivity corridor, given the island nation\u2019s geographical location as the nearest European Union country to the Middle East and India.",
      "Christodoulides said Cyprus was India\u2019s \u201cgateway into Europe\u201d as a base for Indian businesses. He pledged to help implement initiatives such as IMEC that will connect India through specific infrastructure works with the Gulf, the Mediterranean and the European continent.",
      "The Cypriot president said India-EU ties and an upgraded free trade agreement would be among his country\u2019s top priorities when Cyprus assumes the 27-member bloc\u2019s rotating presidency in the first half of 2026.",
      "The Indian prime minister hailed the visit as a harbinger of a new era of India-Cyprus relations built on shared values and deep historic ties that \u201chave been tested time and again.\u201d",
      "Former British colonies Cyprus and India were among members of the Non-Aligned Movement, a collection of nations which opted out of the Cold War choice of allegiance to either the West or the Communist bloc.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Juneteenth celebrations have been scaled back this year due to funding shortfalls as companies and municipalities across the country reconsider their support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Canceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday\u2019s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. The shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.",
      "In Denver, for example, more than a dozen companies backed out of supporting the Juneteenth Music Festival, which is one of the city\u2019s biggest celebrations of the holiday, according to Norman Harris, executive director of JMF Corporation, which puts on the event.",
      "\u201cThere were quite a few sponsors who pulled back their investments or let us know they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t be in a position to support this year,\" said Harris, who has overseen the event for more than a decade.",
      "The festival, which takes place in the historically Black Five Points neighborhood, has been scaled back to one day instead of two because of the budget shortfall. It has only been able to stay afloat thanks to donations from individuals and foundations.",
      "\u201cThankfully, there was a wide range of support that came when we made the announcement that the celebration is in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Juneteenth celebrates the day the last enslaved people in Texas were told they were free on June 19, 1865, two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation. The day has been celebrated by Black Americans for generations, including in Harris\u2019 family, but became more widely celebrated after becoming a federal holiday in 2021.",
      "After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, many companies pursued efforts to make their branding more inclusive, but it has slowed down over the past few years after some received blowback from conservatives and because many companies didn't see it as an important part of their revenue stream, said Dionne Nickerson, a professor in marketing at Emory University.",
      "Some companies can no longer afford to support Juneteenth celebrations because they just don't have the money given the economic uncertainty, according to Sonya Grier, a marketing professor at American University.",
      "\u201cIt's a whole confluence of issues,\u201d Grier said.",
      "Many state and local governments hold or help fund celebrations, but some decided not to this year.",
      "The governor's office in West Virginia stated that the state won\u2019t be hosting any Juneteenth events this year for the first time since 2017 due to a budget deficit. Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey last month signed a bill to end all diversity programs.",
      "\u201cDue to the continued fiscal challenges facing West Virginia, state government will not be sponsoring any formal activities,\u201d deputy press secretary Drew Galang said in an email.",
      "City Council members in Scottsdale, Arizona, dissolved their DEI office in February, which led to the cancellation of the city's annual Juneteenth festival.",
      "Event organizers in Colorado Springs, Colorado, had to move locations due to fewer sponsors and cuts in city funding, said Jennifer Smith, a planner for the Southern Colorado Juneteenth Festival.",
      "Around five companies sponsored the event this year, compared to dozens in years prior, Smith said.",
      "\u201cThey have said their budgets have been cut because of DEI,\u201d and that they can no longer afford it, she said.",
      "Some groups have also mentioned safety concerns. Planners in Bend, Oregon, cited \u201can increasingly volatile political climate\u201d in a statement about why they canceled this year's celebration.",
      "Many local organizations have also had their budgets slashed after the National Endowment for the Arts pulled funding for numerous grants in May.",
      "The Cooper Family Foundation throws one of the largest Juneteenth celebrations in San Diego each year. It was one of dozens of groups told by the NEA in May that its $25,000 grant was being rescinded.",
      "The email said the event no longer aligned with the agency's priorities, said Maliya Jones, who works for the foundation.",
      "The grant money went toward paying for arts and dance performers. The event will still take place this year, but members of the Cooper family will have to divide up covering the costs, said Marla Cooper, who leads the foundation.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s $25,000 we have to figure out how we\u2019re going to pay for,\" Cooper said.",

    "story": [
      "No-bid contracts with politically connected companies have become crucial to the Republican Trump administration\u2019s push for more space to hold immigrants for deportation",
      "LEAVENWORTH, Kan. -- LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly \u2014 in a building so storied that it inspired the term \u201cthe big house.\u201d",
      "Now Kansas\u2019 oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids.",
      "ICE has cited a \u201ccompelling urgency\u201d for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida.",
      "That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge\u2019s past description of the now-shuttered prison as \u201ca hell hole.\" The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president's unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals.",
      "To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for \u201cimmigration enforcement support teams\u201d to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety.",
      "Just last week , Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants \u2014 and earn $66 million in annual revenue.",
      "\u201cNever in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,\u201d said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders.",
      "A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.",
      "When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and \u2014 if private prison executives' predictions are accurate \u2014 possibly to more than 150,000.",
      "ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without \u201cFull and Open Competition.\u201d",
      "Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE\u2019s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan.",
      "The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn\u2019t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical.",
      "Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements.",
      "\u201cI think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,\u201d he said.",
      "CoreCivic's Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE\u2019s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast.",
      "\u201cThat would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center.",
      "Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth's economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation\u2019s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall.",
      "The Leavenworth area's politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president.",
      "But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn't because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge last week issued an order requiring it.",
      "An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service.",
      "In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d",
      "Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017.",
      "\u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples.",
      "When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican \u2014 who said of the prison: \u201cThe only way I could describe it frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hell hole.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes.",
      "The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon.",
      "During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees' experiences and said the company officials \u201cdo our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.\u201d",
      "Besides CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans.",
      "ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it\u2019s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention.",
      "Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that.",
      "ICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren't sought.",
      "The Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes.",
      "The contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units \u201cneighborhoods\u201d and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly.",
      "The financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Private prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump\u2019s reelection in November, CoreCivic\u2019s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo\u2019s by 73%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the gold rush,\u201d Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. \u201cAll of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you\u2019re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.\u201d",
      "Geo's former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders.",
      "CoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger.",
      "CoreCivic officials said ICE's letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal. The Leavenworth deal is worth $4.2 million a month to the company, it disclosed in a court filing.",
      "Tiefer, who served on an independent commission established to study government contracting for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said ICE is \"placing a very dicey long-term bet\u201d because of its past problems and said ICE is giving CoreCivic \u201cthe keys to the treasury\u201d without competition.",
      "But financial analysts on company earnings calls have been delighted. When CoreCivic announced its letter contracts, Joe Gomes, of the financial services firm Noble Capital Markets, responded with, \u201cGreat news.\"",
      "\u201cAre you hiding any more of them on us?\u201d he asked.",

      "A major online shopping festival also helped entice consumers to spend more. The June 18 shopping extravaganza started last month, with online sellers offering discounts on many products.",

      "Manufacturing output rose 5.8% in May year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, compared with 6.1% in April and 7.7% in March. Factory activity surged earlier in the year but has slowed as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "China earlier reported its exports to the United States fell 35% in May from a year earlier, while total exports rose 4.8% in May from a year earlier, much lower than economists\u2019 forecasts and down sharply from an 8.1% jump in April.",

      "Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection.",
      "After 90 days of non-payment, student loan servicers report delinquent, or past-due, accounts to major credit bureaus, which use the information to recalculate the borrower's score. Falling behind on loan payments therefore can affect an individual\u2019s credit rating as severely as filing for personal bankruptcy.",
      "A lower credit score makes it harder or more expensive to obtain car loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto insurance and other financial services at a time when inflation, high interest rates, and layoffs have strained the resources of some consumers.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that in the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more.",
      "Declines that steep may mean the difference between a manageable credit card interest rate and an unmanageable one, or approval or rejection of an application to rent an apartment.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Though payments technically resumed in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024. Last month, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 1 in 4 people with student loan accounts were more than 90 days behind on payments at the end of March.",
      "Kat Hanchon, 33, who works in marketing and higher education in Detroit, was one of them. Hanchon said her score dropped by 57 points as a result of her loans falling delinquent this year. That put her score below 600, or subprime.",
      "When Hanchon received her statement from her loan servicer, her expected monthly payments were higher than before the pandemic-era pause, even though she had enrolled in a repayment plan that takes a borrower's full financial situation into account.",
      "\u201cThey said I now have to pay $358 per month,\" she said. \"I'm not going to be able to pay that. ... But I'm not unusual in the world we're living in right now.\"",
      "Hanchon said she's had to prioritize paying medical expenses \u2014 for a dental crown, a root canal, and an endoscopy \u2014 before she'll be able to consider putting money toward the loans. While her housing situation is secure for the moment, she worries about the annual percentage rate for her credit cards fluctuating.",
      "Lenders, landlords, credit card companies, employers and utility companies all look to consumers\u2019 credit scores to gauge the likelihood of borrowers being able to make regular payments. A higher score typically results in lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms, while a lower score makes it harder to access credit.",
      "The Education Department has said borrowers should receive bills from lenders three weeks before any payments are due, but some people have reported that they have not been notified.",
      "Wait times for calls with loan servicers have been high, and layoffs at the Department of Education have also likely contributed to delayed service, consumer advocates say.",
      "Dom Holmes, 28, who works for a nonprofit in Manheim, Pennsylvania, said he woke up in early May to find his credit score had dropped 60 or 70 points overnight.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden I was delinquent, even though I\u2019d never received notice,\u201d he said.",
      "Holmes has begun the process of appealing the reduction of his credit score, he said. He's been considering a move for professional reasons, and added that he's concerned it could be tough to rent a place to live with his score as it stands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m at the ideal age where I should be starting a family and buying a home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you destroy me financially, what are the chances I\u2019m able to do that and that\u2019s viable for me?\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was the first person in his family to graduate from college, said he still has some outstanding Parent Plus loans, which he intends to keep paying down so that his parents\u2019 credit scores aren\u2019t affected.",

      "Water guns are back squirting at unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Protesters used water guns against unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca on Sunday as demonstrators marched to demand a rethink of an economic model they believe is fueling a housing crunch and erasing the character of their hometowns.",
      "The marches were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\u201cThe squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\u201d Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \u201cBarcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\u201d",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \u201cbubble tea\u201d spots.",
      "\u201cOur lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\u201d",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \u201cEverywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\u201d The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination\u2019s historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident.\u201d They stuck stickers saying \u201cCitizen Self-Defense,\u201d in Catalan, and \u201cTourist Go Home,\u201d in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel\u2019s doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona\u2019s main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but she said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit (28.3 degrees Celsius) weather.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, thank you sweetheart,\u201d Wanda said to the squirter. \u201cI am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\u201d",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain\u2019s government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \u201cYour Airbnb was my home.\u201d",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb\u2019s general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn\u2019t trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn\u2019t resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn\u2019t just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",

Looming over the meeting are his inflammatory threats to make Canada the 51st state and take over Greenland.

      "\u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "While ICE's presence in Los Angeles has captured public attention and prompted Trump to deploy the California National Guard and Marines, immigration authorities have also been a growing presence at farms and factories across the country.",
      "Farm bureaus in California say raids at packinghouses and fields are threatening businesses that supply much of the country\u2019s food. Dozens of farmworkers were arrested after uniformed agents fanned out on farms northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, which is known for growing strawberries, lemons and avocados. Others are skipping work as fear spreads.",
      "ICE made more than 70 arrests Tuesday at a food packaging company in Omaha, Nebraska. The owner of Glenn Valley Foods said the company was enrolled in a voluntary program to verify workers' immigration status and that it was operating at 30% capacity as it scrambled to find replacements.",

If we can\u2019t arrest them in community, we\u2019re going to increase work site enforcement operation. We\u2019re going to flood the zone.\u201d",

      "The United Airlines-operated Boeing 737 Max 8 departed from Newark International Airport in New Jersey at 11:31 a.m. EDT (1531 GMT) and arrived a little over 4 hours later, at 6:39 p.m. local time (1939 GMT), according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.",
      "A seat cost roughly $1,200.",
      "Saturday's flight marks the first direct passage between the U.S. and the Arctic Island for nearly 20 years. In 2007, Air Greenland launched a route between Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport and Kangerlussuaq Airport, some 315 kilometers (196 miles) north of Nuuk. It was scrapped the following year due to cost.",
      "The United Airlines flight took place on U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 79th birthday, which was being celebrated in Washington with a controversial military parade that\u2019s part of the Army\u2019s long-planned 250th anniversary celebration.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he seeks control of Greenland, a strategic Arctic island that\u2019s a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, and has not ruled out military force.",
      "The governments of Denmark, a NATO ally, and Greenland have said it is not for sale and condemned reports of the U.S. stepping up intelligence gathering on the mineral-rich island.",
      "United announced the flight in October, before Trump was re-elected. It was scheduled for 2025 to take advantage of the new Nuuk airport, which opened in late November and features a larger runway for bigger jets.",

      "Tourists will spend money at local businesses, and Greenlanders themselves will now be able to travel to the U.S. more easily, Nathanielsen, the minister for business, mineral resources, energy, justice and gender equality, told Danish broadcaster DR. The route is also an important part of diversifying the island's economy, she said. Fishing produces about 90% of Greenland\u2019s exports.",
      "Tourism is increasingly important. More than 96,000 international passengers traveled through the country\u2019s airports in 2023, up 28% from 2015.",
      "Visit Greenland echoed Nathanielsen's comments. The government's tourism agency did not have projections on how much money the new flights would bring to the island.",
      "\u201cWe do know that flights can bring in much more than just dollars, and we expect it to have a positive impact -- both for the society and travellers,\u201d Tanny Por, Visit Greenland's head of international relations, told The Associated Press in an email.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The death toll in floods in South Africa's Eastern Cape province has risen to 86, the police minister said Saturday as rescuers continued to retrieve bodies from the floodwater.",
      "Senzo Mchunu, the country's top law enforcement official, spoke to police rescue teams that have been searching for missing people and recovering bodies in and around the town of Mthatha since the floods hit in the predawn hours of Tuesday.",
      "Mchunu said the floods were a tragedy but urged local residents to ignore what he called inaccurate reports spreading on social media that the disaster was caused by someone opening the sluice gates at a nearby dam, leading to water surging through communities. Mchunu said the Mthatha Dam in question did not have sluice gates.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Friday during a visit to Mthatha that authorities would investigate if there were any problems with the local dam that might have led to the tragedy.",
      "A wall of water 3-4 meters (10-13 feet) high in places flowed out of the river, the head of the provincial government said, washing away victims with parts of their houses and trapping others inside their homes.",
      "Ramaphosa partly attributed the rains and floods to climate change and said some of South Africa's coastal regions were now constantly vulnerable to weather-related disasters. More than 400 people died in flooding in and around South Africa's east coast city of Durban in 2022, which a study linked to climate change.",
      "The floods in the Mthatha area and a neighboring district caught many people unaware despite weather services issuing warnings last week that an extreme cold front was heading for the region, bringing heavy rains and gale-force winds.",
      "The largely rural region is one of the country's poorest and authorities said communities living in informal housing close to the river were especially vulnerable when it burst its banks. Authorities have been criticized for the rescue response but also for the state of the infrastructure in the area.",
      "Officials believe that people are still missing and the death toll could rise further as rescue teams have been searching through floodwater and damaged homes for nearly a week. One of the bodies retrieved on Saturday was that of a boy that rescuers believed was around 13 or 14 years old.",
      "Many children are among the dead, although authorities haven't given an exact count. Some of the victims were washed up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away from their homes by the floods.",

      "Trump's order didn\u2019t detail the terms of the national security agreement.",
      "But the iconic American steelmaker and Nippon Steel said in a joint statement that the agreement stipulates that approximately $11 billion in new investments will be made by 2028 and includes giving the U.S. government a \u201c golden share \" \u2014 essentially veto power to ensure the country's national security interests are protected against cutbacks in steel production.",
      "\u201cWe thank President Trump and his Administration for their bold leadership and strong support for our historic partnership,\" the two companies said. \"This partnership will bring a massive investment that will support our communities and families for generations to come. We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\u201d",
      "The companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.",
      "\u201cThe partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\u201d the statement said.",
      "U.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.",
      "The companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said the order \u201censures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d",

      "The mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.",
      "U.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.",
      "Nippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.",
      "Nippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.",
      "It also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.",
      "Trump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.",
      "Trump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.",
      "\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d",
      "The proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.",

      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, jumped 16% from 52.2 to 60.5. The large increase followed steady drops that left the preliminary number last month at the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. Consumer sentiment is still down 20% compared with December 2024.",

      "Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands on June 24-25, where they\u2019re due to agree a new defense spending target. He insists that Europe must look after its own security, while Washington focuses on China and its own borders.",

      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "According to the most recent NATO figures, Sweden was estimated to have spent 2.25% of its GDP on defense last year. The Netherlands spent 2.06%, among 22 of the 32 allies who reached NATO\u2019s old benchmark.",

    "story": [
      "In landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, a new inland desert fish farm is growing barramundi \u2014 a tropical species native to Australia",
      "DATELAND, Ariz. -- Storks scatter, white against blue water, as Dan Mohring's pickup truck rumbles down the dirt road. He's towing a trailer full of ground-up beef, chicken, fish and nutrient bits behind him, ready to be shot out of a cannon into the ponds below.",
      "It's time to feed the fish.",
      "Mohring fires up the machine and the food flies out in a rainbow arc. Then the water comes alive. Hundreds of thrashing, gobbling barramundi wiggle their way to the surface, all fighting for a piece. Until, in a few months, they will become food themselves.",
      "In the desert of landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, Mainstream Aquaculture has a fish farm where it's growing the tropical species barramundi, also known as Asian sea bass, for American restaurants.",
      "Mainstream sees it as a sustainable alternative to ocean-caught seafood. They say chefs and conscious consumers like that the food has a shorter distance to travel, eliminating some of the pollution that comes from massive ships that move products around the world. And they and some aquaculture experts argue it's efficient to use the water twice, since the nutrient-rich leftovers can irrigate crops like Bermuda grass sold for livestock feed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of water,\u201d said Matt Mangan, head of Australia-based Mainstream\u2019s American business. \u201cWe want to be here in 20 years', 30 years' time.\u201d",
      "But some experts question whether growing fish on a large scale in an arid region can work without high environmental costs.",
      "That question comes down to what people collectively decide is a good use of water. In Arizona, some places manage water more aggressively than others. But the whole state is dealing with the impacts of climate change, which is making the region drier and water only more precious.",
      "The farm uses groundwater, not Colorado River water. It's a nonrenewable resource, and like mining, different people and industries have different philosophies about whether it should be extracted.",
      "\u201cAs long as groundwater is treated as an open resource in these rural parts of Arizona, they\u2019re susceptible to new industries coming in and using the groundwater for that industry,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute.",
      "Some scientists believe aquaculture can play a role in protecting wild ocean ecosystems from overfishing. And it might play at least a small role in smoothing any supply problems that result from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including those that send the U.S. about 80% of its seafood, per the United States Department of Agriculture.",
      "In the greenhouses at University of Arizona professor Kevin Fitzsimmons' lab in Tucson, tilapia circle idly in tanks that filter down into tubs full of mussels and floating patches of collard greens and lettuce. Fitzsimmons mentored the student who started the tilapia farm eventually bought by Mainstream about three years ago where they now raise barramundi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think desert agriculture is going away,\" he said. \u201cObviously, we want to do it as water-efficient as possible.\"",
      "But not everyone agrees it's possible.",
      "\u201cArtificial ponds in the desert are stupid,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at ASU and director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative. He worried about heavy water losses to evaporation.",
      "Mangan says that evaporation hasn't been an issue so much as the loss of heat in the wintertime. That has required pumping more water since its warmth when it arrives at the surface helps keep the barramundi cozy. But Mangan says they've been improving pond design to retain heat better and have found, after the last year of research and development, that they can cut their water requirement by about half as a result.",
      "Plus, he argues, the water coming out of the fish ponds is \"essentially liquid fertilizer,\" and though it's slightly salty, they use it for crops that can tolerate it, like Bermuda grass dairy cows can eat.",
      "But that's supporting the cattle industry, which contributes more than its share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, Famiglietti said.",
      "\u201cDoing two suboptimal things doesn't make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Purple flowers sprout alongside paddle wheels. Fish bones crunch underfoot. The faint odor of brackish water and ammonia catches in the breeze.",
      "Without groundwater, none of it would be possible.",
      "Some farmers in Arizona rely on water from the Colorado River, but many others use well water to irrigate crops like alfalfa for the dairy industry or the lettuce, cucumbers and melons shipped nationwide year-round.",
      "Arizona has seven areas around the state where groundwater is rigorously managed. Dateland doesn't fall into one of those, so the only rule that really governs it is a law saying if you land own there, you can pump a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of groundwater, said Rhett Larson, who teaches water law at ASU.",
      "What might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d depends from crop to crop, and there's really no precedent for aquaculture, an industry that hasn't yet spread commercially statewide.",
      "Using numbers provided by Mainstream, Porter calculated that the fish farm would demand a \u201cvery large amount\u201d of water, on par with a big ranch or potentially even more than some suburbs of Phoenix. And she noted that although the water use is being maximized by using it twice, it's still depleting the aquifer.",
      "When the company scoped out Arizona to expand, Mangan said they didn\u2019t see nearly the same kinds of regulations as back in Australia.",
      "As part of its growth strategy, Mainstream is also hoping to work with other farmers in the area so more can use nutrient-rich fish pond wastewater to produce hay. They say a few have expressed interest.",
      "The seafood industry needs to reduce its reliance on catching small wild fish to feed bigger farmed ones that humans eat, said Pallab Sarker, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies sustainability in the aquaculture industry. He said seabirds and mammals rely on small species like anchovies and mackerel commonly used in fish meal.",
      "\u201cWe should not rely on ocean fish to grow fish for aquaculture to meet the demand for humans,\u201d Sarker said.",
      "Mainstream gets its fish feed from two suppliers, Skretting and Star Milling, but Mangan and Mohring said they didn't know for certain where those suppliers got their base ingredients from.",
      "Fitzsimmons, of the University of Arizona, also pointed out that between pollution, overfishing and oceanfront development for recreation, the commercial fishing industry had already been facing problems. He doesn't think that Trump's moves this spring to open up marine protected areas for commercial fishing will improve that situation the way aquaculture could.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hunting and gathering from the ocean,\u201d Fitzsimmons said.",

      "Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS began trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling about 3%",
      "Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS fell nearly 3% in morning trading as they made their debut Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "Trading in New York is a long-held goal for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and is now one of the world's largest meat companies. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. JBS is America\u2019s top beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "JBS's minority shareholders voted last month to approve the company's plan to list its shares both in Sao Paulo and New York, casting aside opposition from environmental groups, U.S. lawmakers and others who noted JBS\u2019 record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "JBS said a dual listing would give it broader access to investors and more competitive interest rates, which would help it finance its growth. It has also said a U.S. listing would subject it to more oversight from regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved JBS's planned listing last month.",
      "Still, the proposed listing has received significant pushback. Earlier this week, Mighty Earth, an environmental group, said it sent a letter to the NYSE board urging it to decline the listing. Mighty Earth contends that JBS is illegally profiting from deforested land in Brazil.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that JBS's shareholders reject the planned listing.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "JBS said the outcome showed shareholders were confident in the benefits a dual listing would bring.",

      "The lone survivor was a passenger, Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national of Indian origin.",
      "Ramesh was thrown from the aircraft and walked to an ambulance, according to Dr. Dhaval Gameti, who treated Ramesh. The doctor told The Associated Press that Ramesh was disoriented, with multiple injuries, but that he seemed to be out of danger.",
      "Another medic said Ramesh told him that immediately after the plane took off, it began descending and suddenly split in two, throwing him out before a loud explosion.",
      "The airline said there were no other survivors among the 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Security camera footage verified by The Associated Press showed the plane taking off and then veering slightly to the side. It then drops into a downward glide, disappears briefly from sight and hits the ground.",
      "Moments later, a huge orange and black fireball appears, rising high into the air.",
      "At the crash site, the tail cone of the aircraft with damaged stabilizer fins still attached was lodged near the top of a building. The plane's jagged cavity has torn into the facade. A web of cracks spirals outward from the plane's impact.",

In 2020, a flight for the Air India Express subsidiary skidded off a runway in southern India during heavy rain and cracked in two \u2014 killing 18 people and injuring more than 120 others.",

      "The carrier was under government control from 1953 through 2022.",
      "The Boeing 787 went into service in 2009. This was the first crash of the model, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.",
      "The 787 Dreamliner was the first airliner to make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, recharge faster and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. In 2013 the 787 fleet was temporarily grounded because of overheating of its lithium-ion batteries, which in some cases sparked fires.",
      "There was no information yet about possible causes of the crash. Authorities were searching the crash site Friday as part of the investigation, and there was no word whether the plane's black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",

      "Staying calm resulted in making a downhill 40 footer on the par-5 12th for birdie, then a 22-foot birdie on 14 to take the lead by himself for the first time, at even par.",
      "Everywhere else, there were meltdowns in the rain.",
      "Third-round leader Sam Burns thinned a shot out of a divot and over the 11th green en route to the first of two back-nine double bogeys. He shot 40 on the back and finished tied for seventh.",
      "Adam Scott, the only major champion in the top 10 after Saturday's play, shot 41 in the rain on the back nine and dropped to 12th.",
      "\u201cI didn't adapt to those conditions well enough,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Tyrrell Hatton, who shot 72, briefly threatened and was part of a brief five-way deadlock for the lead before making bogey on the last two holes to finish tied for fourth.",
      "Robert MacIntyre turned out to be Spaun's most persistent challenger. The left-hander from Scotland faded his drive just short of the green on the way to birdie on 17 to get to 1 over and set the target for Spaun, who was playing three groups behind.",
      "MacIntyre was waiting in the locker room when Spaun hit his approach on 18 to 65 feet. Everyone knew it was no sure two-putt. Hardly anyone expected Spaun to get down in one.",
      "\u201cTo watch him hole the putt on 12 down the hill there was unreal,\u201d said Viktor Hovland, who played in the twosome with Spaun. \u201cAnd then he makes another one on 14 that was straight down the hill. And then the one on 18, it\u2019s just absolutely filthy there.\u201d",
      "When they close the book on Spaun's victory at this rainy U.S. Open, maybe the most telling story will be about the way his Father's Day began. As much as the front-nine 40, it had to do with the 3 a.m. trip to the drug store for his daughter Violet, who Spaun said was \u201cvomiting all over.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was kind of a rough start to the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming that on my start, but it kind of fit the mold of what was going on, the chaos.\u201d",
      "Then, through all the rain, and through all those bad lies and bad breaks, Spaun brought some order to it all with a drive and a putt that landed him the silver trophy and gold medal that go to U.S. Open winners.",
      "\u201cWe all sacrifice so much to be here, and to see it come to fruition, that's why we do it,\u201d said Spaun's coach, Adam Schriber. \u201cIt's for these moments.\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- Jair Cunha and Igor Jesus scored in the first half and Botafogo beat the Seattle Sounders 2-1 at the Club World Cup on Sunday night.",
      "Botafogo opened the scoring 28 minutes into the game as Cunha headed in a pass from Alex Telles. It came after a contentious yellow card to Nouhou Tolo gave the visitors a direct free kick just beyond the corner of the penalty box. Sounders players felt the call was unfair as there had been some unobserved jostling between Tolo and Artur before Tolo shoved his opponent to the ground.",
      "Botafogo doubled the lead in the first half's final minutes with another headed goal. Vitinho connected with his 24-year-old star teammate Igor Jesus, who sent a powerful header to the bottom corner.",
      "The Sounders played better in the second half, buoyed by their energetic subs. Four minutes after coming into the match, Paul Rothrock provided the assist for Christian Roldan\u2019s header in the 75th minute that deflected off Jesus.",
      "The Sounders had two shots on target in a row in the final 30 seconds of stoppage time to try to tie the score, but the first was well blocked by a defender before John smothered Rothrock\u2019s attempt.",
      "Seattle will now have to try to win points off the perceived titans of Group B, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain to avoid going out in the group stage. Botafogo played good defense to hold onto its lead and is second in Group B on goal difference.",
      "\u201cObviously, they\u2019re a great team, and they put us under pressure in moments, but we matched them. The difference in the first half was just quality and a couple of key moments\u2026 I think if you looked at the statistics, you would say that Sounders were in a good spot, but obviously everything is the score line, and we couldn\u2019t find that second goal.\u201d \u2014 Seattle Sounders head coach Brian Schmetzer",
      "\u201cThe second half, in terms of our defense, it was not good. We didn\u2019t take possession and \u2026 Seattle scored a goal with some luck, but it was deserved.\u201d \u2014 Botafogo head coach Renato Paiva",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Coastal Carolina's unbeaten Jacob Morrison was dominant into the eighth inning and the Chanticleers capitalized on Oregon State's early mistakes to extend their win streak to 25 games with a 6-2 victory in the College World Series on Sunday night.",
      "Morrison went 7 2/3 innings for his longest outing in over two months. The 6-foot-8, 245-pound right-hander retired 16 straight over the middle innings and left with two outs in the eighth after allowing five hits, walking none and striking out seven.",
      "\u201cFor us to play like that on this stage, pretty darn remarkable,\u201d coach Kevin Schnall said. \u201cThese guys were unbelievable tonight and then Jacob Morrison \u2014 winner's win.\u201d",
      "Coastal Carolina had to win five elimination games on its way to the 2016 national championship in its CWS debut. The Sun Belt Conference's team of teal hadn\u2019t been back to Omaha until this year, and its 2-0 start puts them in control of their bracket.",
      "The Chanticleers (55-11) would advance to the best-of-three finals with another win Wednesday. Their opponent will be either Louisville or Oregon State (48-15-1), which meet in an elimination game Tuesday.",
      "Morrison (12-0) had a 3-0 lead when he went to the mound for the bottom of the first. All three runs were unearned and the result of an unusual sequence of events.",
      "Leadoff man Caden Bodine reached on star shortstop Aiva Arquette\u2019s throwing error \u2014 only his sixth error of the season but second in two games \u2014 and went to second on a balk by Ethan Kleinschmit (8-5). The next batter, Sebastian Alexander, was down 0-2 in the count when he was called out for not being alert to the pitcher, as required, when the 20-second clock hit 8.",
      "Blake Barthol walked and Walker Mitchell and Blagen Pado were hit by pitches, but Pado was called out for not trying to get out of the way. Colby Thorndyke then delivered a two-out, bases-clearing double into the right-center gap.",
      "\u201cWe had a hit by pitch that didn't go our way, which became two outs with bases loaded, and I came up in the same situation earlier in the season and didn't get it done,\u201d Thorndyke said. \u201cI knew if I could get any runs in, and with Jacob on the mound, it would give our dugout confidence.\u201d",
      "Oregon State\u2019s Easton Talt homered leading off the third to make it a two-run game, but the Chanticleers pulled away by scoring on an error and wild pitch in the fourth. It was 6-1 in the fifth when Thorndyke was hit by a pitch and scored from first on Dean Mihos' double.",
      "Morrison's streak of 16 straight retired batters got rolling after Talt's homer and consecutive flies to the warning track by Arquette and Gavin Turley.",
      "\u201cI don't know if I was nervous the first time through the order,\u201d Morrison said, \u201cbut it was awesome seeing long fly balls caught in right and left field. I settled in and was very confident after that.\u201d",
      "The Beavers went into the NCAA Tournament seventh nationally in fielding (.982) with just 35 errors in 54 games. They've committed 10 errors in 10 games since, including five in their first two CWS games.",
      "Two errors on the same play led them to blowing a ninth-inning lead against Louisville in their CWS opener Friday. They survived that, scoring in the bottom of the ninth for a 4-3 walk-off win.",
      "Oregon State wouldn't overcome its two errors, two hit batters, two wild pitches and six walks Sunday. Turley hit his 20th homer leading off the bottom of the ninth against Hayden Johnson, and the Chanticleers had to call on closer Ryan Lynch to get the last out when the Beavers put two runners on base. The Chanticleers improved to 42-0 when leading after six innings.",
      "\u201cSix walks, we can\u2019t do that. Hit by pitch or two, again, that ain't going to work,\" Beavers coach Mitch Canham said. \"Minimizing mistakes is important. I anticipate us going out and playing cleaner baseball Tuesday.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Famed Oakmont bared its teeth on the back nine at the U.S. Open",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Tyrrell Hatton, in the mix in the final round of a major for the first time in the late Sunday gloom at the U.S. Open, watched his tee shot on the 17th hole drift to the right and exhaled.",
      "If there was a place to \u201cmiss,\u201d Hatton knew it was to the right of the green on the uphill, 314-yard par 4.",
      "And he was right. At just about every place but Oakmont.",
      "When Hatton reached the top of the hill, the fiery Englishman whose emotions are never too far from his sleeve discovered his ball had settled into the course's signature knotty rough on a downslope above a greenside bunker.",
      "Just about anywhere else, the shot rolls into the sand below, and he splashes out with a chance to maybe even take the lead. Only there isn't anywhere else like the iconic links-style course carved out of the Western Pennsylvania hills.",
      "Hatton's pitch from an impossible downhill lie didn't reach the green, and he slammed his club into the ground in protest. A chip and two putts later, he was two back. When his tee shot on the par-4 18th sailed into the rough again, it was over.",
      "\u201cWhat happened on 17 is going to hurt a lot for a long time,\u201d Hatton said after tying for fourth at 3-over 283, four back of winner J.J. Spaun. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019ve been in contention in a major, and that was exciting, and unfortunately, I feel like through a bit of bad luck I had momentum taken away from me and ultimately ended up not being my day.\u201d",
      "Asked about what exactly constituted the \u201cbad luck,\u201d Hatton bristled but only briefly. He'd made his frustration about a course design that includes having most of its 160-plus bunkers well-guarded by an already penal rough well known on Saturday, when he was forced to take an awkward stance to hack out of a sand trap alongside the 15th green on Saturday, leading to a bogey.",
      "What happened in the waning minutes of a rain-delayed and chaos-filled final 18 holes of the championship was just more of the same.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve missed it in the right spot and got punished, which ultimately I don\u2019t think ends up being fair,\u201d Hatton said.",
      "That's Oakmont. Besides, Hatton was hardly the only one who found himself creeping up the leaderboard as the frontrunners faltered, only to ultimately succumb themselves.",
      "Carlos Ortiz, a member of LIV Golf like Hatton, was part of a five-way tie for the lead on the back nine. Ortiz's tee shot on the 503-yard par-4 15th sailed left, forcing him to punch out to the fairway. A wedge from 134 yards landed 40 feet short of the cup. Three putts later, he was on his way to a 3-over 73 finish and a tie for fourth.",
      "\u201cIt was a great week, but obviously I\u2019m disappointed right now the way it happened,\" said Ortiz, who became the first Mexican player since 1972 to place inside the top 10. \u201cI did everything I can.\u201d",
      "Viktor Hovland, who was out on the practice range nearly until dusk on Saturday night trying to find something \u2014 anything really \u2014 to build on, began the day two shots off the lead but never managed to get to pull even with the scrum in front of him.",
      "The Norwegian, who was grouped with Spaun, \u201csaw a lot of stuff\u201d as the leaderboard continued to shuffle and re-shuffle over the final 90 minutes. Keeping track was difficult, particularly with the electronic boards having \u201cdangerous weather\" alerts splashed across them. Ultimately, Hovland couldn't find the rhythm necessary.",
      "Instead, it was Spaun who delivered with a pair of birdies, including a 64-footer on the 18th that immediately etched itself into U.S. Open lore. In a way, the ending helped. Spaun went out and took a tournament up for grabs and grabbed it.",
      "Hovland, who called the last of Spaun's 279 strokes \u201cabsolutely filthy,\u201d had to settle for third, his fourth finish inside the top three at a major. All without being the one standing on the green afterward with the trophy in hand.",
      "Yet he tried to remain upbeat. He believes he's trending back to where he was in 2023, when he finished tied for seventh at the Masters and then tied for second at the PGA a month later. He's already won this year, though he complained about his form afterward.",
      "There was none of that on Sunday. Oakmont is hard enough as it is. No need to pile on.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been tearing myself down a little too much,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cEven though I do know I need to work on some stuff and get back to where I used to be in a way mechanically, but in the interim, I can still perform at a really high level, and there\u2019s a lot of good stuff.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think when I was walking up 14 or 12, and I seen a leaderboard that the leader was at even par. I kind of knew where I was at, I was at 3-over, I think, at the time,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThe whole week, I\u2019ve said level par in my head. I\u2019m just looking for four even pars.

      "Palmer birdied six of his first seven holes that day. MacIntyre's rally was more about staying afloat and waiting for the leaders to fall back. The left-hander from Scotland actually bogeyed two of his first three holes to drop to 5 over, but a 58-foot putt for eagle on the par-5 fourth started him in the right direction.",
      "\u201cThat kind of settled me down,\u201d he said. \u201cThat got me into somewhat of a groove and back in the golf tournament. Then the back nine was just all about fighting.\u201d",
      "MacIntyre said he dried off his shirt and kept stretching during a 97-minute weather delay that interrupted the final round. Down the stretch he was sharp, hitting his tee shot just short of the green on the par-4 17th and moving to 1 over with a birdie there. He had a birdie putt from just over 30 feet on the last hole, but that one didn't drop, and Spaun finished the tournament with two straight birdies to win it.",
      "But MacIntyre did enough to make him earn it. Of the top six finishers, only MacIntyre shot under par on the final day. And the Scot was the only player in the field to shoot under par both Saturday and Sunday.",
      "\"Today was a day that I said to myself, Why not? Why not it be me today?\" he said. \u201cWhen I was going round, and I just trusted myself, trusted my caddie Mike (Burrow), trusted all the work that I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "The Boston Red Sox have traded Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants in a blockbuster deal",
      "BOSTON -- The Boston Red Sox traded slugger Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday in a deal that could shake up pennant races on both coasts.",
      "San Francisco sent right-hander Jordan Hicks, lefty Kyle Harrison, outfield prospect James Tibbs III and minor league righty Jose Bello to Boston for the 28-year-old designated hitter, who had bristled at his demotion from third base this year.",
      "The Giants are two games back of NL West-leading Los Angeles after losing 5-4 to the Dodgers on Sunday night.",
      "Harrison was on his way to the bullpen to warm up for Sunday's start when he was called back to the clubhouse and informed of the trade. Reliever Sean Hjelle was told about 30 minutes before first pitch that he would start.",
      "\u201cYeah, it was a lot, and it was late, but you know what? This is something we really needed,\u201d Giants manager Bob Melvin said.",
      "\u201cTo get a guy like Devers \u2026 there\u2019s a lot you have to give up for him, but this fits us perfectly. It\u2019s a power left-handed bat, a guy that can go the other way and hit for power in our ballpark. I mean, it\u2019s tailor-made for us, so kudos to the front office to swing this.\u201d",
      "A three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5 million contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston\u2019s 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.",
      "But his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office \u201c should do their jobs \u201d and look for another player.",
      "A day after Devers\u2019 comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora.",
      "The situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained what the team called a significant right quadriceps injury on May 23.",
      "\u201cEverybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers \u2014 he basically was the face of the franchise,\" San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said in an on-field interview during the ESPN broadcast.",
      "Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco\u2019s president of baseball operations in September, said he reached out to Craig Breslow, Boston's chief baseball officer, about two weeks ago. Trade talks picked up momentum over the past few days.",
      "Posey and Melvin declined to address what position Devers would play in San Francisco \u2014 \"That's a conversation for myself, Bob and Zack (general manager Zack Minasian) to have with him,\" Posey said \u2014 but they are convinced Devers' bat will have a significant impact on a lineup that has produced only 16 homers from the left side this season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited about adding one of the best hitters in all of major league baseball to our lineup,\u201d Posey said. \u201cWe're obviously taking on a lot of dollars, but there\u2019s a belief that adding a guy like this puts us in a good position keep winning ballgames, get into the playoffs and try to win a World Series, which is our ultimate goal.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6 1/2 games behind division-leading New York.",
      "Devers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.",
      "The Giants have lacked slugging since Barry Bonds hit 45 homers in 2004; they are the only team in the majors who have not had a batter hit 30 homers since then. Devers has hit at least 30 homers in three different seasons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough losing (Harrison and Hicks) \u2026 but we\u2019re getting a guy back who changes the lineup, who\u2019s probably a top-10 hitter in baseball every year,\u201d Giants pitcher Logan Webb said.",
      "\u201cAny time you add a player of that caliber, I think you give yourself a chance every day.\u2029I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s gonna hit, but I don\u2019t think it really matters. The guy\u2019s a stud, plain and simple. I\u2019m excited about it.\u201d",
      "Devers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump -- just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.",
      "But the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 midseason shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop \u2014 and fan favorite \u2014 Nomar Garciaparra.",
      "The Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.",
      "The acquisition of Devers is the latest big move by Posey, 38. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15 million, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182 million, seven-year deal in December.",
      "Harrison, 23, is 9-9 with a 4.48 ERA and 178 strikeouts in 39 games for the Giants over three seasons. Hicks, 28, was 5-12 with a 4.83 ERA and 139 strikeouts in 42 games over two seasons. Tibbs, 22, was the 13th overall pick in last year's draft; he is hitting .246 with 12 homers and 32 RBIs in 57 games for Single-A Eugene of the Northwest League this season. Bello, 20, is 1-0 with a 2.00 ERA in eight games for the Giants' rookie league team in Scottsdale, Arizona.",

      "Connor McDavid scored his first goal of this Stanley Cup Final in Game 5, only after he and the Edmonton Oilers fell behind 3-0 on the way to getting pushed to the brink by the defending champion Florida Panthers",
      "It took until 13 minutes left in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final for Connor McDavid to score his first goal of the series, and it was after he and the Edmonton Oilers fell behind 3-0 to the Florida Panthers, on the way to losing and getting pushed to the brink.",
      "Before that, he led all scorers with six assists, and only teammate Leon Draisaitl has more points than McDavid's seven. Of course, the best hockey player in the world is in the spotlight no matter what he does, and he hasn't been able to break out and put the Oilers on his back thanks in large part to Selke Trophy winner Aleksander Barkov and the Panthers keying in on him defensively and slowing him down at all costs.",
      "Coach Kris Knoblauch thinks it has been a bit of an unfortunate final for McDavid given the amount of scoring chances that just haven't gone in.",
      "\u201cI think Connor\u2019s been one of our best players every single night, and that\u2019s what we expect,\u201d Knoblauch said Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve got no issues with his game. Obviously, our team relies heavily on him and Leon and how they\u2019re playing, but I think that it\u2019s tight checking for everyone and it\u2019s not going to be a midseason game against a non-playoff team when sometimes he\u2019s had 10 or 12 scoring chances. Those numbers are obviously reduced playing against a good team like Florida.\u201d",
      "The Panthers have defended McDavid and Draisaitl \u201creasonably well,\" according to coach Paul Maurice, who acknowledged two of the NHL's most talented forwards are bound to get their opportunities.",
      "Barkov's line, with Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart, has been tasked with playing against McDavid, perhaps to the detriment of offense. That's the job, so Reinhart was noticeably upset to give up that late goal Saturday night.",
      "\"I\u2019m upset every time they get a goal,\" Reinhart told reporters in Edmonton. \"It\u2019s a team effort defending guys like that. We\u2019ve known all series the challenge is there for us. No one really cares in our locker room who\u2019s producing each night. It\u2019s just a matter that someone is at the right times. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "McDavid led all scorers through three rounds playing with Zach Hyman on his right wing. Hyman's right wrist was dislocated with ligaments torn on a hit late in the Western Conference final, and left winger Ryan Nugent-Hopkins was bothered by an undisclosed injury during a stretch against Florida.",
      "Loading up by putting McDavid and Draisaitl on the ice together \u2014 the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 has not been used as often because Hyman isn't around.",
      "\u201cWith the absence of Zach Hyman, it makes it more difficult putting those two together because of the depth of our lineup,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cWith what we have right now, to run those two together for long periods of time makes it more difficult for our depth on our team.\u201d",
      "That puts even more pressure on McDavid in Game 6 on Tuesday night to keep the series going, as the Panthers again focus on preventing him from doing anything of the sort.",

      "The New Zealander led 60 of 100 laps Sunday at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez to earn his first Cup victory since he won in his NASCAR debut at the inaugural 2023 street course race in Chicago. That victory changed his career trajectory and Van Gisbergen left Australia V8 Supercars, where he was a multiple champion, for a full-time move to NASCAR.",
      "Although he had success in the Xfinity Series \u2014 he won three races last year as Trackhouse Racing developed him for a Cup Series ride \u2014 Van Gisbergen has struggled this year at NASCAR's top level.",
      "He started the race ranked 33rd in the Cup standings with only one top-10 finish through the first 15 races of the season. But his victory in Mexico City earned him an automatic berth into NASCAR's playoffs with a shot to race for the Cup Series championship.",
      "Van Gisbergen benefitted from an early pop-up rain shower on the first lap of the race because he's an exceptionally skilled driver on a wet surface. His win at Chicago was in monsoon-like conditions.",
      "He won the pole in Mexico City and started the race as the BetMGM betting favorite, particularly since rain was in the forecast. He had to contend with several challengers, Ty Gibbs and Christopher Bell of Joe Gibbs Racing among them, but took the lead for good with 31 laps remaining.",
      "Trackhouse now has two of its drivers \u2014 Ross Chastain and Van Gisbergen \u2014 locked into the playoffs. But it was a bit of a disappointment for Daniel Suarez, the Monterrey native who thrilled the hometown crowd with a win in the Xfinity Series race on Saturday, as he failed to challenge his teammate for the win and finished 19th.",
      "Suarez, who appeared to be blinking back tears as he sang along with the Mexican national anthem in pre-race ceremonies, desperately wanted the home win in this contract year with Trackhouse. He was the face of this event as NASCAR ventured outside the U.S. with its top series for the first time since 1958.",
      "Bell finished second in a Toyota for JGR \u2014 16.567 seconds behind the winner. He was followed by Chase Elliott in a Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. Alex Bowman, who hurt his back in a crash last week at Michigan, withstood the pain for a fourth-place finish in his Hendrick Chevrolet.",
      "Michael McDowell of Spire Motorsports was fifth and followed by John Hunter Nemechek in a Toyota for Legacy Motor Club. Chase Briscoe of JGR was seventh and followed by Cole Custer for Haas Factory as the highest-finishing Ford driver. William Byron of Hendrick was ninth and Chris Buescher of RFK Racing rounded out the top 10.",
      "Chevrolets took five of the top-10 positions, including the victory.",
      "Kyle Busch, who started the race at the bottom of the playoff standings, suffered a massive setback when he crashed out of the race on the sixth lap and finished last in the 37-car field.",
      "Busch, who was ranked 15th in the Cup Series standings when he arrived in Mexico City, blamed the incident on the wet track.",
      "\u201cJust in the rain, and I went down into (Turn) 11 and got on the brakes pretty hard, and everything was fine, everything was comfortable, stopped really good,\u201d he said. \"And I\u2019m like \u2018OK I can be a little more aggressive getting into 1,\u2019 and I figured it was going to be fine, and as soon as I went to the brakes, it was like being on ice, and I was just sliding.",
      "\u201cAbout a second a half or so, I was trying to figure out which direction to go, and I was like I\u2019ve got to turn this thing around backward, because I\u2019m going to nail some people. Hate it for all those involved in my mishap. I hate that the rain came and now it\u2019s nice and dry. Just have to go fight for more points in another week.\u201d",
      "NASCAR Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon was selected to give the command for drivers to start their engines and admitted before the race he'd done some practicing.",

      "\u201cShohei is getting antsy, which is a good thing for us,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the team announced Ohtani would get the ball on Monday night.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be one or two innings, but my guess is probably an inning to start. But it\u2019s a good thing. The live, simulated, or whatever, sort of ran its course. He\u2019s ready to make his debut on the mound.\u201d",

      "In the second season of a $700 million, 10-year contract, he paused his pitching work after a mound session on Feb. 25 to prepare for opening day as a hitter, then started bullpen sessions on March 29 and batting practice on May 25.",

      "A three-time MVP, Ohtani is hitting .297 with an NL-leading 1.035 OPS, 25 homers and 41 RBIs. A batter only last year in his first season with the Dodgers, Ohtani hit .290 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases.",
      "On Sunday, Roberts said rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki appears likely to be sidelined for a lengthy stretch. With Sasaki (right shoulder impingement), Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Tyler Glasnow (right shoulder inflammation) on the injured list, the Dodgers have resorted to bullpen games.",
      "Sasaki has not pitched in a game since May 9 and is not part of the team\u2019s long-term pitching plans this season.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s what the mindset should be,\u201d Roberts said before the game. \"Being thrust into this environment certainly was a big undertaking for him, and now you layer in the health part and the fact he\u2019s a starting pitcher, knowing what the build-up (required to return) entails \u2026 I think that\u2019s the prudent way to go about it.\u201d",

His walked 22 and struck out 24 in 34 1/3 innings and his fastball averaged 95.7 mph, down 3-4 mph from his average in Japan.",
      "Roberts said Sasaki was pain-free when he resumed throwing in early June, but the pitcher was shut down after feeling discomfort this past week. Sasaki recently received a cortisone injection in the shoulder; Roberts said no further scans are planned.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s pain,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s discomfort, if it\u2019s tightness, if he\u2019s just not feeling strong, whatever the adjective you want to use. That\u2019s more of a question for Roki, as far as the sensation he\u2019s feeling.",

      "He finished at 1-under 279, the sole survivor to par, and won by two shots over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland, who watched the finish from a scoring room and could only applaud the stunning conclusion.",
      "Five players shared the lead with an hour to go. Four players were still tied as the U.S. Open made its way to the final four holes that frustrated Sam Burns and Tyrrell Hatton, and crushed the hopes of Adam Scott and Carlos Ortiz.",
      "The last man standing was Spaun, the 34-year-old Californian with an eerie resemblance to the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris.",
      "Never mind that Spaun lacked the pedigree of so many players groomed in elite competition, that he had only one PGA Tour title until Sunday, was playing in only his second U.S. Open and had never cracked the top 20 in his previous eight majors.",
      "The ending was magical. The road leading to his U.S. Open title was hard work and resiliency, especially Sunday. One shot behind to start the final round, he had five bogeys in six holes, including a shot that hit the pin on No. 2 and caromed 35 yards back into the fairway, turning birdie into a bogey.",
      "\u201cIt felt like as bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot. I tried to just continue to dig deep. I\u2019ve been doing it my whole life,\u201d Spaun said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been the biggest difference this year has been being able to do that. Fortunately, I dug very deep on the back nine, and things went my way, and here we are with the trophy.\u201d",
      "It was calamity for so many others.",
      "Burns had a two-shot lead going to the 11th tee, made a double bogey from a divot in the first cut on No. 11 and from a lie in the fairway on No. 15 so wet he thought he deserved relief. He shot 78.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tough golf course, and I didn\u2019t have my best stuff, and clearly it showed,\u201d he said.",
      "Scott, trying to become the first player to go more than 11 years between major titles, was tied for the lead with five holes to play. One of the best drivers could no longer find the fairway. He played them in 5 over and shot 79.",
      "\u201cI missed the fairway. I hadn\u2019t done that all week really. Then I did, and I paid the price and lost a lot of shots out there,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Ortiz and Hatton also slashed away in slushy lies, all making mistakes that cost them a chance to survive this beast of day.",
      "The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun.",
      "He was four shots behind and facing the tough ninth hole. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes.",
      "\u201cThe weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,\u201d Spaun said.",
      "Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way.",
      "But oh, that finish.",
      "MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead.",
      "Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner on the 17th, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup.",
      "On the final putt, he was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it dropped as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted.",
      "He raised both arms and tossed his putter, jumping into the arms of caddie Mark Carens.",
      "The celebration carried into those who lost the battle.",
      "Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood.",
      "\u201cUnbelievable. What a putt to win. That\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sad about how I finished, but I\u2019m very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing.\u201d",
      "Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all \u2014 the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start.",
      "\u201cAfter his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,\u201d Hovland said. \"Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn\u2019t expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast.\u201d",
      "Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine. But he missed far too many birdie chances even three-putting from 12 feet no the 11th hole. The world's No. 1 player finished with a 70 to tie for seventh with Jon Rahm (67) and Burns, his best friend who will feel the sting.",
      "He had a double bogey by missing the green into a bad lie on the slope of a bunker. He missed a pair of 6-foot birdie putts to seize control. And when he made a mess of the 15th for another double bogey.",
      "Through it all, Spaun emerged as a U.S. Open champion hardly anyone saw coming \u2014 not at the start of the year, not at the start of the round.",

      "The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The ratings are down for these NBA Finals, as was expected. Oklahoma City vs. Indiana is a small-market series and the numbers reflect that, with viewership down about 20% from last season and on pace for the poorest TV turnout since the pandemic \u201cbubble\u201d finals in 2020.",
      "Don't blame the Thunder and Pacers for that.",
      "It's been a back-and-forth over the first four games \u2014 and now, a best-of-three will decide the NBA title. Game 5 is in Oklahoma City on Monday night, with the Thunder trying to take their first lead of the series and the Pacers trying to head back home one win away from a championship.",
      "\u201cI do not care, to be honest with you,\" Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton said when asked what he'd say to those who, for whatever reason, haven't tuned into the series. \u201cThis is high-level basketball and I'm excited to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Game 1 had a frantic Indiana comeback and a Haliburton buzzer-beater. Game 2 saw Oklahoma City do what it has done in the majority of games all season: take full control early and roll to a win. Game 3 in Indiana had the Pacers' bench fueling a win. And Game 4 saw the MVP do MVP things, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 15 points in the final five minutes to carry the Thunder to a comeback win.",
      "Add it up, and it's Thunder 2, Pacers 2. The Thunder are outscoring the Pacers by 3.3 points per game; the Pacers are outshooting the Thunder by 1.4%. It's only the third time in the last 15 years that the finals have had all that through four games \u2014 2-2 tie, 3.3-point differential or less, shooting within 1.4% of each other. Golden State-Boston had it in 2022, and Dallas-Miami had it in 2011.",
      "It all seems pretty even, and the looks aren't deceiving.",
      "\u201cIt's good for y\u2019all,\" Thunder guard Alex Caruso said. \u201cGood for me, we\u2019d be getting ready for a parade right now.\u201d",
      "Parades in Indianapolis or Oklahoma City are going to have to wait at least until this coming weekend. This series seems like it could have debunked some of the tired complaints about the game in recent years: the nobody-plays-defense, too-much-isolation, too-many-3s arguments that have been out there.",
      "\u201cI think from an outside perspective it\u2019s great for the league,\u201d Caruso said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for basketball. I think these two teams play stylistically the best versions of basketball right now as far as pressure and being influencing and aggressive on defense \u2014 causing turnovers, making stuff hard and then offensively free-flowing, shot making, passing the ball. ... A great brand of basketball.\u201d",
      "And that means it could end up as a great finals, whether more people start watching or not.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to play this deep into the season,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cIf you\u2019re playing this deep into the season, your opponent is going to be really good. They have won 12 games to get to this point just like we have. You just know it\u2019s going to be an unbelievable level. There are definitely times in it where (you're saying), \u2018Man, this is a high, high level.\u2019\"",
      "This marks the 32nd time that a finals has been 2-2 going into Game 5. The winner of Game 5 has gone on to ultimately prevail in 23 of the 31 previous occasions.",
      "\u201cWe are both two games away,\" Haliburton said. \u201cAnything can happen here.\u201d",

      "\u201cI only had one pair on me, so that\u2019s all I could do,\u201d Judge said, smiling.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re rivals when we step on that field for 7 o\u2019clock,\" Judge told The Associated Press on Sunday morning. \"He\u2019s a dad.

I\u2019ve been watching him since 2017. I think last year, we started communicating. I\u2019m in awe with everything that goes on with him because it\u2019s (Shohei) Ohtani and Judge.

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them.

      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams.

The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components.

      "Las Vegas police said the shooting on Sunday night near the landmark Bellagio fountains was an isolated incident between the victims and the suspect, who had been feuding on social media since at least 2023. The suspect, identified by police as Manuel D. Ruiz, surrendered to authorities Monday morning at a police station outside of Las Vegas.",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Nearly one million books published as early as the 15th century \u2014 and in 254 languages \u2014 are part of a Harvard University collection being released to AI researchers Thursday. Also coming soon are troves of old newspapers and government documents held by Boston's public library.",

      "\u201cIt is a prudent decision to start with public domain data because that\u2019s less controversial right now than content that\u2019s still under copyright,\u201d said Burton Davis, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft.",
      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "The announcement \u2014 the first to publicly denounce a gaming app \u2014 indicates that authorities are widening the crackdown that has followed anti-government protests in 2019. Authorities have crushed or silenced many dissenting voices through prosecutions under the 2020 national security law imposed by Beijing and a similar, homegrown law enacted last year.",

      "The game application was developed by ESC Taiwan, which did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. On the application's Facebook page, the developer posted about surging searches for the game name and a Hong Kong broadcaster\u2019s news report about Tuesday\u2019s development.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",

      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",

Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021.

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called \u201cbitcoin treasury companies\u201d as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.",
      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",

      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",

      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",

    "summary": "The recent shootings of lawmakers in Minnesota are part of a disturbing trend toward politically linked violence, ABC News analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Violence has expanded its scope in recent years.",
      "The shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers has sent shockwaves across the nation. This grim development marks a disturbing escalation: while violence is not new, its recent migration to the state and local level represents a concerning trend.",
      "Violence against public officials has been increasing in recent years, including the two recent assassination attempts in 2024 against President Donald Trump. The 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabby Giffords, initially perceived as an anomaly at the time, now appears to have been a precursor to a rising tide of threats against an expanding sphere of elected officials.",
      "This trend was further highlighted in 2017 when a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, was targeted by an individual motivated by political grievances. Five people were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise, when the gunman unleashed a hail of 70 rounds.",
      "In many of these cases, investigations consistently revealed that the suspects harbored either real or perceived grievances against the politician or their political beliefs, and subsequently acted upon those grievances.",
      "A 2015 study by the U.S. Secret Service, examining attacks against the federal government, shed light on the perpetrators. It found that offenders choose their targets for reasons including retaliation, the furtherance of ideological beliefs, personal gain, or seeking fame and attention. Nearly half of these offenders exhibited evidence of fixation \u2013 an intense or obsessive preoccupation with an individual, activity, or idea. Over half had prior arrests or criminal charges, and more than half had a history of violence towards others.",
      "Furthermore, the study found, almost half communicated their intentions to others about the target or directly with their targets. A third of the offenders made threats or veiled references of harm through online postings, verbal comments, personal manifestos, letters, and other means. Only three offenders communicated threats verbally and in-person directly to their targets.",
      "The 2025 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Homeland Threat Assessment underscored these concerns, stating that \"the 2024 election cycle will be an attractive target for many adversaries.\"",
      "\"Some domestic violent extremists (DVEs) likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election,\" the assessment added.",
      "So, why is this rise in targeted violence occurring?",
      "A June 2024 Chapman University study suggests \"declining levels of confidence in some of our most important social institutions and growing political divisions across society\" as a possible cause. The study notes a steady increase in threats against public officials since 2017, coinciding with a general rise in polarization following the 2016 presidential election. It further posits that \"the growing number of threats may represent a growing tolerance for violence among Americans and the formation of 'a culture that helps normalize their use to express certain ideas and emotions.'\"",
      "The study identifies what it says are significant obstacles to effective responses, including the blurry line between protected speech and criminal threats and the anonymity facilitated by digital technology.",
      "As the study points out, the digital age, with its access to the \"dark web,\" violent online content, and the ease with which individuals can identify public officials, their residences, and their activities, has created unprecedented targeting opportunities. This helps explain the observed increase in violence across all levels of government, including state and local officials, a trend that unfortunately appears to be continuing.",
      "For those in the public sphere, prioritizing personal protection and implementing basic security measures are crucial. These include alarm systems at home, security cameras to identify visitors, and controlling who comes into contact with them. While being a public official and ensuring safety can be conflicting and elusive goals in this climate, these fundamental steps can significantly enhance their security.",

      "All 50 states as well as Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories have agreed to sign a $7.4 billion settlement with the company and once-prominent family behind OxyContin, officials announced Monday.",
      "The settlement resolves pending litigation against Purdue Pharma, which, under the leadership of the Sackler families, invented, manufactured and aggressively marketed opioid products for decades, according to the lawsuits. States and cities across the country said it fueled waves of addiction and overdose deaths.",
      "The attorneys general in 55 states and territories have signed on to the historic settlement, which they said will end the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and bar them from making, selling or marketing opioids in the U.S.",
      "California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia led the team that negotiated the settlement, which marks the largest of its kind involving the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "\"As Pennsylvania families and communities suffered during an unprecedented addiction crisis, Purdue and the Sacklers reaped the mammoth profits from their products,\" Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday said in a statement. \"This monumental settlement achieves the top priority of getting as much money as quickly as possible to prevention, treatment, and recovery programs across the Commonwealth. My office will continue engagement with municipal leaders to ensure millions of dollars reach every corner of the state.\"",
      "Purdue introduced OxyContin, a brand name of oxycodone, in the 1990s and filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019 after the company was sued thousands of times.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a prior settlement in June 2024 that would have awarded $6 billion to state and local governments.",
      "The Sacklers and Purdue subsequently boosted their settlement contribution to $7.4 billion. At the time, Purdue said in a statement to ABC News, \"We are extremely pleased that a new agreement has been reached that will deliver billions of dollars to compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver treatment and overdose rescue medicines that will save lives. We have worked intensely with our creditors for months in mediation, and we are now focused on finalizing the details of a new Plan of Reorganization, which we look forward to presenting to the bankruptcy court.\"",
      "The $7.4 billion will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention and recovery programs over the next 15 years.",
      "A significant amount of the funds will be distributed in the first three years, with the Sacklers paying $1.5 billion and Purdue paying approximately $900 million in the first payment, followed by $500 million after one year, an additional $500 million after two years, and $400 million after three years.",
      "\u201cThere will never be enough justice, accountability or money to restore the families whose lives have been wrecked or to right the terrible consequences of the Sackler family\u2019s craven misconduct,\" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement on Monday. \"What we announce today is both momentous and insufficient, the culmination of years of tumultuous negotiations and legal battles all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "Now that the state sign-on period has ended, local governments across the country will be asked to join the settlement, contingent on bankruptcy court approval. A hearing on that matter is scheduled in the coming days, the attorneys general said.",
      "A board of trustees selected by participating states in consultation with other creditors will determine the future of Purdue, which will continue to be overseen by a monitor and will be prevented from lobbying or marketing opioids.",

Amy Klobuchar mourned the two Minnesota state lawmakers shot early Saturday at their homes in what leaders are calling an \"act of targeted political violence,\" calling them \"friends\" and \"decent people\" who were simply \"trying to represent the people that they were elected to represent.\"",
      "The Minnesota Democrat told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that people should \"know\" the victims of political violence and threats -- in this case, state Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was killed alongside her husband, and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, who underwent surgery after the attack.",
      "\"She was a true leader, and I loved her work, but was always so grounded and such a decent person. I think that's probably the best word to describe her. You look at her pictures and you know what she was about. So we miss her greatly, and so when you hear about statistics about political violence and threats, I just want people to know who we're talking about,\" Klobuchar said about Hortman.",
      "\"Or Senator Hoffman. Equally respected. Got into politics because his daughter has spina bifida and she couldn't get insurance, and he wanted to advocate for her. Decent people who didn't deserve this to happen to them,\" Klobuchar continued.",
      "Authorities have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter as the suspected gunman and are continuing to search for him.",
      "Klobuchar described Hortman as an illustrious lawmaker and compassionate public servant, who began her career in public service as a mother with young children who had a background working at her father's auto parts company. Hortman easily juggled teaching Sunday school, leading a Girl Scout troop and training service dogs for veterans, Klobuchar said.",
      "The senator said she first got to know Hortman when she was a young lawmaker and she was struck with how she was able to know \"practically every person in her district.\"",
      "\"Melissa Hortman was a woman that I wish everyone around the country knew,\" Klobuchar told Raddatz. \"When you think about a true public servant who goes into it for the right reasons, it's Melissa.\"",
      "Klobuchar said that Hortman's ability to \"juggle it all\" may have contributed to the political success she'd been able to notch, especially in the past year with a divided legislature, when she worked alongside the state Senate's Republican leader to artfully negotiate a budget and avoid government shutdown.",
      "When she was the Speaker of the House, Hortman also spearheaded landmark legislation like paid family leave and free lunch for students, Klobuchar said.",
      "Klobuchar called the suspect \"evil,\" and \"smart\" on Sunday.",
      "\"He's evil. He is smart. He has killed without a second thought, and there's a $50,000 reward,\" she told Raddatz.",
      "The Minnesota Democrat lauded the cooperation between Minnesota leaders and state law enforcement.",
      "\"We couldn't be getting more help from law enforcement,\" Klobuchar said, applauding also local police officers' swift work on the ground, when they checked in on Hortman soon after getting called to Hoffman's house.",
      "\"Those local police officers at that moment not only appear to have saved [Hoffman] and his wife's life, but also had given us major leads to who he was and why he was doing this,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "Klouchar said she \"hasn't seen\" the target list written by the gunman, something that law enforcement sources say had dozens of Minnesota Democrats on it.",
      "Those on the list included Minnesota lawmakers Gov. Tim Walz, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith and state Attorney General Keith Ellison, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Klobuchar called political violence a \"rampant problem\" and said she \"believes\" that could have been one of the gunman's motivations for the Minnesota lawmaker shootings.",
      "\"I believe that there's some things in the manifesto that would lead you down that trail to believe that this was one of his motivating forces,\" Klobuchar said.",
      "She also highlighted the bipartisan statement against political violence that the Minnesota congressional delegation released after the shootings on Saturday.",
      "\"You speak with one voice to condemn this political violence. There's no place for this politically motivated violence in our democracy,\" Klobuchar said on Sunday. \"This is a rampant problem that the public and all of us have to deal with -- and also against judges, and all of us should condemn all of that violence,\" she said.",

      "Protests are set to take place in more than 2,000 communities around the U.S.",
      "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump's administration and to counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.",
      "Here's what to know about the protests.",
      "What is the idea behind \"No Kings Day\"?",
      "\"'No Kings Day' is the largest single-day, peaceful protest in recent American history, made up of millions of normal, everyday Americans who are showing up in more than 2,000 communities around the country to say, 'we don't do kings in America,'\" Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Indivisible and other organizations involved with the coalition coordinating the protests have said that the protests are meant to protest what they say is overreach by the Trump administration on immigration enforcement and deportations, civil rights and cuts to the federal government.",
      "They've also pointed to how the military parade is being held on Trump's birthday. Trump has denied any connection between the parade's timing and his birthday, pointing to how June 14 is Flag Day.",
      "The groups coordinating the protests originally announced the initiatives in early May, after reports of the upcoming military parade, but organizers have said that the protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles and the response from the federal government have driven much more interest to the events.",
      "Where and when will the protests be?",
      "The protests will be held across the country and even beyond the United States, with a flagship event held in Philadelphia. Levin told ABC News there are now more than 2,000 events planned \"just about everywhere, everywhere but downtown D.C. -- intentionally so.\"",
      "According to Levin, the organizers did not want to give Trump a rationale to retaliate against peaceful protests in D.C. or to say that the protesters were protesting the military.",
      "\"We are ceding downtown D.C. Trump can have it for that day, and instead, we're organizing literally everywhere else,\" Levin said.",
      "Most of the protests around the country will be held in the morning, ahead of the parade. Some in the western part of the country may occur concurrently with the parade, which is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET.",
      "What has Trump said about the protests?",
      "Asked on Thursday about his thoughts on the \"No Kings\" protests planned across the country for Saturday, Trump said he did not feel like a king.",
      "\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said.",
      "\"A king would say, 'I'm not gonna get this'... he wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off' and after years we get it done. No, no, we're not a king, we're not a king at all,\" he added, referencing the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate Majority leader, respectively.",
      "Trump, on Tuesday, had threatened to use \"heavy force\" against \"any\" protesters at the military parade in the nation's capital; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that \"of course\" the president supports peaceful protestors. Organizers of the No Kings protests have continuously emphasized they are not planning protests in Washington.",
      "Are there safety concerns surrounding the protests?",
      "Organizers have emphasized that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent, pointing to various trainings they've held this week about safety and deescalation.",
      "Levin said there were some concerns about outside agitators trying to disrupt protests, but he said people shouldn't feel \"as if we're going into battle. That's not what this is about. This is peaceful protest. People are going to have funny signs, people are going to be dancing, people are going to be chanting, people are going to be expressing their First Amendment rights.\"",
      "At Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's recommendation, all \"No Kings\" events not already underway were canceled due to \"the individual who assassinated a Democratic lawmaker\" still being at large, according to the \"No Kings\" website.",
      "At least two states, Texas and Missouri, have said they are calling up the National Guard in their states as a precaution against the potential for any violence at protests on Saturday. The governors of both states affirmed that peaceful protests are legal.",
      "Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson Ericka Miller told ABC News that the Capitol and Capitol grounds were evacuated at 1 p.m. local time due to a \"credible threat against state lawmakers planning to attend\" the No Kings protest. The event was supposed to begin at 5 p.m.",
      "\"We are working to address the threat,\" Miller said.",
      "What comes next?",
      "The events on Saturday are not meant to be the be-all end-all of the groups' efforts to protest the Trump administration, Levin said.",
      "\"I think sometimes folks think a protest has to be everything. It's got to solve all your problems ... We need persistent, peaceful, people-powered organizing them on the ground in blue states, red states and purple states that allow people to push back against the escalating overreach from this administration,\" Levin said.",

      "\"I'm heartbroken,\" said Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a decorated Navy pilot who is also the lead plaintiff in Shilling vs. Trump -- one of three federal lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's executive order barring transgender service members.",
      "Shilling, who is based in the D.C. area, is also the president of Sparta Pride -- an organization advocating for 2,400 transgender people in the military and those who hope to join.",
      "Reflecting on the upcoming parade commemorating the 250th anniversary of the Army's founding, Shilling, who has served since 2005, told ABC News that \"military might does not equal patriotism.\"",
      "\"The members who take an oath and dedicate their lives to service -- that's patriotism, whether or not we have tanks or rocket launchers, that has nothing to do with it,\" Shilling said.",
      "And according to Shilling, for active duty members of Sparta, who were faced with the \"heartbreaking\" decision to voluntarily separate from the military or get kicked out, abandoning their commitment to serving their country is what's \"keeping them up at night.\"",
      "\"When I sit in these town halls that we do with Sparta, people are really struggling with the idea of giving up or quitting, or, you know, not fulfilling their oath,\" she said. \"And that's actually what's keeping these men, women and folks you know, up at night. They feel like they have a duty to keep serving and keep fighting.\"",
      "The Pentagon's new ban went into effect in early May shortly after the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could enforce the ban on transgender people in the military while legal challenges proceed in lower courts.",
      "After the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon issued a memo giving active duty service members until June 6 -- last Friday -- to self-identify and begin the voluntary separation process. Transgender service members in the reserve forces have until July 7 to voluntarily separate.",
      "The memo also stated that after June 6, military commanders will be told to identify people in their units who have a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria or exhibit symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria. The move would initiate a referral to an annual health check-up that would begin what could be a lengthy process for each individual that could lead to their removal from the military.",
      "Shilling, who will be eligible for retirement at 20 years in September, told ABC News that faced with these options, she chose to self-identify and begin the process of voluntarily separating from the military, but noted that she made the decision \"under duress.\"",
      "\"I hit my retirement date in September. So if I didn't volunteer at that time, I could theoretically be kicked out between June and September and lose everything,\" she said. \"So it was very much a decision made under duress. You know, I was coerced into it because we knew that the voluntary separation would give me an honorable discharge with some portion of my retirement, and I'd be able to keep all of my benefits.\"",
      "The Pentagon incentivized service members with gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate ahead of the June 6 deadline by offering benefit payment packages that would be more than double what would be received if they were to separate involuntarily. Those who voluntarily separated would not have to risk paying back the recruitment or retention bonuses they may have earned during their military service.",
      "Its policy came after the Trump administration announced a ban on transgender service members in a Jan. 27 executive order, where President Donald Trump directed the Defense Department to revise the policy allowing transgender troops to openly serve.",
      "\"Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,\" the order said.",
      "The order further argued that receiving gender-affirming medical care is one of the conditions that is physically and mentally \"incompatible with active duty.\"",
      "Defense officials estimate that as of last December, about 4,240 current active-duty, National Guard and Reserve service members had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "There are more than 2.1 million military service members serving on active-duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Advocacy groups have put the actual number of transgender service members as being much higher, at around 15,000.",
      "\"There's a lot of fear,\" Shilling said, reflecting on service members like herself who are losing their jobs.",
      "She also said that being banned from the military has taken an emotional toll on the community -- some of whom have left \"rough homes\" and found a family in the military.",
      "\"For a lot of people, this was, you know, the dream they've always wanted, and now their family is saying, you're not good enough. They're being rejected again by another family,\" she said. \"And that's pretty brutal.\"",
      "When asked how she feels about her decision to voluntarily separate from the military, Shilling said that she is at \"peace\" because she knows that the fight is not over.",
      "\"I'm at peace,\" she said. \"I'm going to thrive, and I'm going to be able to fight this \u2026 and continue to fight for that America that I believe in -- that good, righteous America, and a lot of these service members feel very much the same.\"",

      "California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla has continued to defend himself and refute claims by the Trump administration that he \"crashed\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference before federal officers shoved him outside the room, pushed him to the floor and handcuffed him.",
      "Padilla, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety, provided more details about the incident Thursday night during an interview on MSNBC -- in which he said he was not a threat and had merely raised his voice to ask a question.",
      "The senator claimed he did not barge into the news conference, as alleged by Noem, but rather he was in the federal building for an approved scheduled briefing with representatives of the Northern Command. He said that meeting was delayed by Noem's news conference in a nearby room, where she was discussing the administration's use of the National Guard to respond to protests over President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "Padilla said he decided to go to listen to Noem's news conference and asked the National Guard member and FBI agent escorting with him if he could go.",
      "\"We're, the whole time, being escorted in this federal building by somebody from the National Guard, somebody from the FBI. I've gone through screening. This is a federal building. And so, I tell them, 'Let's go listen to the press conference.' They escort me over to that room,\" Padilla told MSNBC.",
      "\"The folks that were escorting me in the building walked me over. I didn't even open the door. The door was opened for me. And I spent a few minutes in the back of the room just listening in until the rhetoric, the political rhetoric got to be too much to take. So, I spoke up,\" he later added.",
      "During her news conference, Noem claimed she was going to \"liberate\" Los Angeles \"from the socialists and the burdensome leadership this governor and mayor have placed on this country and this city.\"",
      "Padilla told MSNBC that he felt he needed to speak out, said he introduced himself and started asking a question before the officers pushed him out of the room as news cameras, reporters and onlookers recorded the incident.",
      "Noem said law enforcement reacted as they did because Padilla came toward her without identifying himself. She told Fox News Thursday that no one knew who he was and that he was \"lunging forward.\"",
      "Video of the incident captures Padilla identifying himself and saying he wanted to ask a question as he is pushed out of the room; it's not clear from the video if he identified himself before that point, including as he came forward toward the podium. Padilla was wearing a navy blue polo shirt with a small U.S. Senate logo, but it was covered under a navy blue jacket. He said he was not wearing a U.S. Senate security pin at the time of the incident.",
      "After he was quickly released, he and Noem had a private conversation for \"10-15 minutes\" after the incident, according to both the senator and the secretary.",
      "Noem said that Padilla will likely not be charged.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday said Padilla should be \"ashamed of his childish behavior.\"",
      "\"He crashed the middle of an official press conference being held by a cabinet secretary, recklessly lunged toward the podium where @Sec_Noem was speaking, and then refused to leave the room and follow the directions of law enforcement officers,\" Leavitt posted to X.",
      "Outraged Democratic senators quickly came to Padilla's defense Thursday, claiming Noem and the officers mistreated the senator.",
      "\"This is an administration that has no respect for our democracy, for our institutions, for the separation of powers, for a co-equal branch of government,\" California Sen. Adam Schiff said.",
      "Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters, \"I've seen that one clip. It is horrible. It is shocking at every level. It's not the America I know.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans chastised Padilla, with Johnson going so far as saying censure might be needed. A vote to censure does not hold any power beyond a public condemnation of the member's behavior and it does not deny the member privileges.",
      "Sen. Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday evening that he had spoken with Padilla and the Senate Sergeant At Arms and had attempted to reach Noem in an effort to gather the facts.",
      "\"We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator, that is, try to gather all of the relevant information,\" he said.",
      "When asked if he thought what occurred was appropriate based on what he had so far seen, Thune said, \"That's all I've got to say.\"",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",

      "A Wisconsin dairy farmer has alleged in a federal lawsuit that the Trump administration is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers by continuing programs that favor minorities",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A Wisconsin dairy farmer alleged in a federal lawsuit filed Monday that the Trump administration is illegally denying financial assistance to white farmers by continuing programs that favor minorities.",
      "The conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in federal court in Wisconsin on behalf of a white dairy farmer, Adam Faust.",
      "Faust was among several farmers who successfully sued the Biden administration in 2021 for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan.",
      "The new lawsuit alleges the government has continued to implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were instituted under former President Joe Biden. The Wisconsin Institute wrote to the USDA in April warning of legal action, and six Republican Wisconsin congressmen called on the USDA to investigate and end the programs.",
      "\u201cThe USDA should honor the President\u2019s promise to the American people to end racial discrimination in the federal government,\u201d Faust said in a written statement. \u201cAfter being ignored by a federal agency that\u2019s meant to support agriculture, I hope my lawsuit brings answers, accountability, and results from USDA.\u201d",
      "Trump administration spokesperson Anna Kelly did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.",
      "The lawsuit contends that Faust is one of 2 million white male American farmers who are subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA.",
      "The lawsuit names three USDA programs and policies it says put white men at a disadvantage and violate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal treatment by discriminating based on race and sex.",
      "Faust participates in one program designed to offset the gap between milk prices and the cost of feed, but the lawsuit alleges he is charged a $100 administrative fee that minority and female farmers do not have to pay.",
      "Faust also participates in a USDA program that guarantees 90% of the value of loans to white farmers, but 95% to women and racial minorities. That puts Faust at a disadvantage, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Faust has also begun work on a new manure storage system that could qualify for reimbursement under a USDA environmental conservation program, but 75% of his costs are eligible while 90% of the costs of minority farmers qualify, the lawsuit contends.",
      "A federal court judge ruled in a similar 2021 case that granting loan forgiveness only to \u201csocially disadvantaged farmers\u201d amounts to unconstitutional race discrimination. The Biden administration suspended the program and Congress repealed it in 2022.",
      "The Wisconsin Institute has filed dozens of such lawsuits in 25 states attacking DEI programs in government. In its April letter to the USDA, the law firm that has a long history of representing Republicans said it didn't want to sue \u201cbut there is no excuse for this continued discrimination.\u201d",
      "Trump has been aggressive in trying to end the government\u2019s DEI efforts to fulfill a campaign promise and bring about a profound cultural shift across the U.S. from promoting diversity to an exclusive focus on merit.",

      "Canceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday\u2019s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. The shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.",
      "In Denver, for example, more than a dozen companies backed out of supporting the Juneteenth Music Festival, which is one of the city\u2019s biggest celebrations of the holiday, according to Norman Harris, executive director of JMF Corporation, which puts on the event.",

      "Juneteenth celebrates the day the last enslaved people in Texas were told they were free on June 19, 1865, two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation. The day has been celebrated by Black Americans for generations, including in Harris\u2019 family, but became more widely celebrated after becoming a federal holiday in 2021.",

      "Iran is one of the world\u2019s major producers of oil, though sanctions by Western countries have limited its sales. If a wider war erupts, it could slow the flow of Iran\u2019s oil to its customers and keep the price of crude and gasoline higher for everyone worldwide.",

      "It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed \u2014 after the Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation.",
      "The resulting Juneteenth holiday \u2014 it's name combining \u201cJune\u201d and \u201cnineteenth\u201d \u2014 has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries. In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday \u2014 expanding its recognition beyond Black America.",
      "This year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.",
      "Still, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.",
      "\u201cI don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,\u201d said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \u201cI've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.\u201d",
      "People who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \u201cright\u201d way to celebrate Juneteenth?",
      "For beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:",
      "It depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans\u2019 true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \u201cBlack Codes,\u201d enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.",
      "Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.",
      "Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.",
      "Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question \u2018What is Juneteenth?\u2019\u201d Morial said.",
      "Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn\u2019t learn about it until his 30s.",
      "\u201cI think many folks haven\u2019t known about it \u2014 who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn\u2019t celebrate it,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt was like just a part of history. It wasn\u2019t a celebration of history.\u201d",
      "For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn\u2019t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.",
      "Search online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you\u2019ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth\u2019s history.",
      "The National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.",
      "The red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.",
      "More people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.",
      "Aside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.",
      "In recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.",
      "\u201cI would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,\u201d Morial said. \u201cIf you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.\u201d",
      "Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there\u2019s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you\u2019re not Black. In fact, embrace it.",
      "\u201cI would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn\u2019t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.",
      "\u201cBecause 1776, Fourth of July, where we\u2019re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBlack people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s typical to wish people a \u201cHappy Juneteenth\u201d or \u201cHappy Teenth,\u201d according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.",
      "\u201cYou know how at Christmas people will say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 to each other and not even know each other?\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou can get a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 from everybody. This is the same way.\u201d",

      "\"He was right-leaning politically but never fanatical, from what I saw, just strong beliefs,\u201d said Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.",
      "Boelter, who worked as a security contractor, gave a glimpse of his beliefs on abortion during a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023. While there, Boelter served as an evangelical pastor, telling people he had first found Jesus as a teenager.",
      "\u201cThe churches are so messed up, they don\u2019t know abortion is wrong in many churches,\u201d he said, according to an online recording of one sermon from February 2023. Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.",
      "He appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.",
      "\u201cHe never talked to me about abortion,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIt seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.\u201d",
      "A married father with five children, Boelter and his wife own a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house on a large rural lot about an hour from downtown Minneapolis that the couple bought in 2023 for more than a half-million dollars.",
      "He worked for decades in managerial roles for food and beverage manufacturers before seeking to reinvent himself in middle age, according to resumes and a video he posted online.",
      "After getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master\u2019s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.",
      "After moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.",
      "In that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.",
      "Records show Boelter and his wife started a security firm in 2018. A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter\u2019s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols. The company\u2019s homepage says it provides armed security for property and events and features a photo of an SUV painted in a two-tone black and silver pattern similar to a police vehicle, with a light bar across the roof and \u201cPraetorian\u201d painted across the doors. Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company\u2019s name across the front.",
      "In an online resume, Boelter also billed himself as a security contractor who worked oversees in the Middle East and Africa. On his trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he told Chris Fuller, a friend, that he had founded several companies focused on farming and fishing on the Congo River, as well as in transportation and tractor sales.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,\u201d he wrote in a message shared with the AP.",
      "But once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities \u2014 a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter \u201cvoluntarily left\u201d that position about four months ago.",
      "\u201cThis is devastating news for all involved,\u201d Koch said, declining to elaborate on the reasons for Boelter\u2019s departure, citing the ongoing law enforcement investigation.",
      "Boelter had also started spending some nights away from his family, renting a room in a modest house in northern Minneapolis shared by friends. Heavily armed police executed a search warrant on the home Saturday.",
      "In the hours before Saturday\u2019s shootings, Boelter texted two roommates to tell them he loved them and that \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while,\u201d according to Schroeder, who was forwarded the text and read it to the AP.",
      "\u201cMay be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\u201d Boelter wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything more and implicate you in any way because you guys don\u2019t know anything about this. But I love you guys and I\u2019m sorry for the trouble this has caused.\u201d",

      "FBI officials say two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large",
      "NEWARK, N.J. -- Two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large, FBI officials said Sunday.",
      "The four men busted out of the Delaney Hall detention center in Newark during reports of disorder there by breaking through an interior wall that led to an exterior one, and were able to escape from a parking lot, according to U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, and Homeland Security officials.",
      "The FBI said Joel Enrique Sandoval-Lopez and Joan Sebastian Castaneda-Lozada were taken back into custody since Friday, while Franklin Norberto Bautista-Reyes and Andres Felipe Pineda-Mogollon were still on the lam. Officials did not immediately say how or where the two who are back in custody were caught. All four men were in the country illegally and had previously been charged with crimes by local police in New Jersey and New York City, Homeland Security officials said.",
      "Sandoval-Lopez, from Honduras, was charged with unlawful possession of a handgun in October and aggravated assault in February, officials said. Castaneda-Lozada, from Colombia, was charged with burglary, theft and conspiracy, authorities said.",
      "Bautista-Reyes, from Honduras, was charged in May with aggravated assault, attempt to cause bodily injury, terroristic threats and a weapon crime. Pineda-Mogollon, from Colombia, was charged with minor larceny and burglary crimes. The FBI has announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of each man.",
      "A spokesperson for the New Jersey public defenders' office, which represented Sandoval-Lopez, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Sunday. Attorney information for the other three men could not be located on online court records.",
      "Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, a Democrat who\u2019s been critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, cited reports of a possible uprising and escape after disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night and protesters outside the center locked arms and pushed against barricades as vehicles passed through gates. Much is still unclear about what unfolded there.",
      "But GEO Group, the company that owns and operates the detention facility for the federal government, said in a statement that there was \u201cno widespread unrest\u201d at the facility.",
      "Delaney Hall has been the site of clashes this year between Democratic officials who say the facility needs more oversight and the Trump administration and those who run the facility.",
      "Baraka was arrested May 9, handcuffed and charged with trespassing. The charge was later dropped and U.S. Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver was later charged with assaulting federal officers stemming from a skirmish that happened outside the facility. She has denied the charges.",

      "A man who was believed to be part of a peacekeeping team for the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest in Salt Lake City shot at a person who was brandishing a rifle at demonstrators, striking both the rifleman and a bystander who later died at the hospital, authorities said Sunday.",
      "Police took the alleged rifleman, Arturo Gamboa, 24, into custody Saturday evening on a murder charge, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said at a Sunday news conference. The bystander was Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39, a fashion designer from Samoa.",
      "Detectives don't yet know why Gamboa pulled out a rifle or ran from the peacekeepers, but they accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death. The Associated Press did not immediately find an attorney listed for Gamboa or contact information for his family in public records.",
      "Redd said the man believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, dressed in a neon green vest, fired three shots from a handgun at Gamboa, inflicting a relatively minor injury but fatally shooting Ah Loo. Redd did not share the man's name.",
      "Volunteer peacekeeping teams are common for protests, said Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for 50501 Movement, which was a partner in the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest. But the organizers ask attendees, including the peacekeepers, not to bring weapons, she said. Still, Parker said they stopped what could've been a larger mass casualty event.",
      "\u201cOur safety team did as best as they could in a situation that is extremely sad and extremely scary,\" said Parker.",
      "Ah Loo, known as Afa, was a husband and father to two children and a fashion designer who leaned into his Samoan heritage, according to a GoFundMe page organized to support his family. Ah Loo founded Creative Pacific, an event celebrating the diversity of the Pacific Islands, with workshops, artists and a fashion runway. He was on Season 17 of the fashion design reality TV show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d",
      "The gunshots sent hundreds of protesters running, some hiding behind barriers and fleeing into parking garages and nearby businesses, police said in a statement. \u201cThat's a gun. Come on, come on, get out,\" someone can be heard saying in a video posted to social media that appears to show the events.",
      "\u201cNo Kings\u201d protests swept across the country on Saturday, and organizers said millions rallied against what they described as President Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies.",
      "Confrontations were largely isolated. In Riverside, California, authorities said a driver of an SUV struck a woman who was participating in a demonstration and sped away. The woman had \u201csignificant injuries\u201d but was stable, police said, adding that they were still searching for the driver.",
      "Outside the Arizona statehouse, a social media video showed protesters Saturday jeering at and then skirmishing with a masked man, who eventually pulled out a handgun, causing the crowd to scatter. Another video showed Arizona Department of Public Safety officers taking the man into custody.",
      "The shooter and another person in a neon vest allegedly saw Gamboa separate from the crowd of marchers in downtown Salt Lake City, move behind a wall and withdraw a rifle around 8 p.m., Redd said.",
      "When the two men in vests confronted Gamboa with their handguns drawn, witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle into a firing position and ran toward the crowd, said Redd.",
      "That's when one of the men dressed in the vests shot three rounds, hitting Gamboa and Ah Loo, said Redd. Gamboa, who police said didn't have a criminal history, was wounded and treated before being booked into jail.",
      "Redd said that the peacekeepers\u2019 actions are also part of the investigation.",
      "Police said they recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask and a backpack at the scene.",

      "Flash flooding caused by torrential rains killed five people in northern West Virginia and rescue crews were searching for three other people who were missing Sunday as authorities assessed damage to roads, bridges, natural gas lines and other infrastructure.",
      "Officials said 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of Wheeling and Ohio County within about a half hour on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cWe almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\u201d Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \u201cDuring this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents. So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \u201cIt happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I\u2019ve been doing this for 35 years. I\u2019ve seen major floods here in the city and the county. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d",
      "Authorities said vehicles were swept into swollen creeks, some people sought safety in trees and a mobile home caught fire.",
      "Similarly, swift flash flooding arrived in Marion County, south of Wheeling and Ohio County, early Sunday afternoon, causing extensive damage to bridges, roads and some homes, the county's Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management said in a Facebook post. The county's 911 line has already processed at least 165 calls for service since the storms began.",
      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency in Marion County Sunday evening.",
      "Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling in the state\u2019s northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday's early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re searching the banks, we\u2019re searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\u201d Blazier said. \u201cWe\u2019re using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we\u2019re trying to recover anybody that\u2019s missing.\u201d",
      "There were about 2,500 reported power outages in the county Sunday, Morrisey confirmed in a news release Sunday evening, which updated the number of people confirmed dead to five, with three more missing. He has declared a state of emergency in Ohio County and mobilized the National Guard to support emergency operations.",
      "\"In many respects, this is kind of a unicorn event, because a lot of the rain had very narrow areas and there were roughly 3 to 4 inches of water that fell in the area in less than an hour,\" Morrisey said at a press conference earlier Sunday. \"That\u2019s very, very difficult to deal with.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cYour friends, your neighbors, your first responders and people in the community, they\u2019re out working very hard to find people. That\u2019s our No. 1 task right now, trying to identify anyone who may still be out there.\u201d",
      "The West Virginia rains followed heavy downpours in San Antonio on Thursday that killed 13 people. More than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours in the Texas city, causing fast-rising floodwaters to carry more than a dozen cars into a creek.",

      "BELLE PLAINE, Minn. -- Authorities searched a vehicle on a rural road outside Minneapolis on Sunday that they believe had been used by the man wanted in the shootings of two Democratic lawmakers, as a state on edge struggled to make sense of the brazen political violence that left one leader dead.",
      "Former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday. Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin home, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.",
      "Authorities named 57-year-old Vance Boelter as a suspect, saying he wore a mask as he posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.",
      "More than 24 hours after authorities first confronted him outside Hortman's home, Boelter was still on the loose after fleeing on foot. The FBI issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They circulated a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings.",
      "Investigators found a cowboy hat near the vehicle and were working to determine whether it belongs to Boelter. Law enforcement officers were searching the area, including nearby homes. The officials could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The search was happening in rural Sibley County, roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis, where Boelter had a home with his wife and five children. Residents in the area received an emergency alert about the located vehicle that warned them to lock their doors and cars.",
      "A crowd of officers were seen congregated on a dirt road near the abandoned dark sedan believed to have been used by Boelter. Doors on both sides of the car were splayed open, with discarded items scattered near the vehicle. Some officers broke off and walked into a wooded area off the road. The car was later towed away.",
      "\u201cWe believe he\u2019s somewhere in the vicinity and that they are going to find him,\u201d U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBut right now, everyone\u2019s on edge here, because we know that this man will kill at a second.\u201d",
      "The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned.",
      "Brightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, \u201cYou were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.\u201d",
      "Pam Stein came with flowers and kneeled by the memorial. An emotional Stein called Hortman an \u201cabsolute powerhouse\u201d and \u201cthe real unsung hero of Minnesota government.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe had a way of bringing people to the table and getting things done like no one else could do,\u201d said Stein, a retired lawyer.",

      "Authorities have not yet given details on a motive.",
      "A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, the officials said. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about healthcare facilities, according to the officials.",
      "A Minnesota official told the AP that lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The attacks prompted warnings to other state elected officials and the cancellation of planned \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations against President Donald Trump, though some went ahead anyway, including one that drew tens of thousands to the State Capitol in St. Paul. Authorities said the suspect had \u201cNo Kings\u201d flyers in his car.",
      "Law enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, a person familiar with the matter told AP. The person could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other.",
      "Around 6 a.m. Saturday, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn't say what he had done.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way. \u2026 I\u2019m sorry for all the trouble this has caused,\" he wrote in messages viewed by the AP.",
      "Police first responded to reports of gunfire at the Hoffmans\u2019 home shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "Local police from Brooklyn Park were assisting with the call and decided to proactively check on Hortman's home nearby, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said Saturday.",
      "There, they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer leaving the house. Officers confronted him, he fired at them and officers returned fire. The suspect then retreated back into the home and fled on foot, Bruley said. He left behind the vehicle designed to look like a police car where authorities later found writings.",
      "On social media, Gov. Tim Walz remembered Hortman Sunday as, \u201cThe most consequential Speaker in state history.\u201d",
      "Hortman, 55, had been the top Democratic leader in the state House since 2017. She led Democrats in a three-week walkout at the beginning of this year\u2019s session in a power struggle with Republicans. Under a power-sharing agreement, she turned the gavel over to Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth and assumed the title speaker emerita.",
      "Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota\u2019s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions \u2014 and to protect providers who serve them.",
      "The couple had two adult children.",

      "One egg out of a clutch of eight laid on Jan. 27 successfully hatched on June 4, officials said. Besides being Goliath's first offspring, it's also the first time one of the endangered reptiles has hatched at Zoo Miami. The animals' numbers were drastically reduced before the 20th century by human exploitation and the introduction of invasive species to the Galapagos Islands.

      "Goliath arrived at the Bronx Zoo in 1929 and moved to Zoo Miami in 1981. He has bred with several different females during his time at Zoo Miami, but he has never sired an offspring. The new hatchling's mother, Sweet Pea, is estimated to be between 85 and 100 years old.",
      "Both parents are doing well in their public habitat, officials said. The hatchling appears to be healthy in a separate enclosure. Wild hatchlings are not raised by their parents.",

      "The prospect of a work requirement for able-bodied Medicaid recipients is sparking fears",
      "It took Crystal Strickland years to qualify for Medicaid, which she needs for a heart condition.",
      "Strickland, who's unable to work due to her condition, chafed when she learned that the U.S. House has passed a bill that would impose a work requirement for many able-bodied people to get health insurance coverage through the low-cost, government-run plan for lower-income people.",
      "\u201cWhat sense does that make?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about the people who can\u2019t work but can\u2019t afford a doctor?\u201d",
      "The measure is part of the version of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d bill that cleared the House last month and is now up for consideration in the Senate. Trump is seeking to have it passed by July 4.",
      "The bill as it stands would cut taxes and government spending \u2014 and also upend portions of the nation\u2019s social safety net.",
      "For proponents, the ideas behind the work requirement are simple: Crack down on fraud and stand on the principle that taxpayer-provided health coverage isn't for those who can work but aren\u2019t. The measure includes exceptions for those who are under 19 or over 64, those with disabilities, pregnant women, main caregivers for young children, people recently released from prisons or jails \u2014 or during certain emergencies. It would apply only to adults who receive Medicaid through expansions that 40 states chose to undertake as part of the 2010 health insurance overhaul.",
      "Many details of how the changes would work would be developed later, leaving several unknowns and causing anxiety among recipients who worry that their illnesses might not be enough to exempt them.",
      "Advocates and sick and disabled enrollees worry \u2014 based largely on their past experience \u2014 that even those who might be exempted from work requirements under the law could still lose benefits because of increased or hard-to-meet paperwork mandates.",
      "Strickland, a 44-year-old former server, cook and construction worker who lives in Fairmont, North Carolina, said she could not afford to go to a doctor for years because she wasn't able to work. She finally received a letter this month saying she would receive Medicaid coverage, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's already kind of tough to get on Medicaid,\u201d said Strickland, who has lived in a tent and times and subsisted on nonperishable food thrown out by stores. \u201cIf they make it harder to get on, they're not going to be helping.\u201d",
      "Steve Furman is concerned that his 43-year-old son, who has autism, could lose coverage.",
      "The bill the House adopted would require Medicaid enrollees to show that they work, volunteer or go to school at least 80 hours a month to continue to qualify.",
      "A disability exception would likely apply to Furman's son, who previously worked in an eyeglasses plant in Illinois for 15 years despite behavioral issues that may have gotten him fired elsewhere.",
      "Furman said government bureaucracies are already impossible for his son to navigate, even with help.",
      "It took him a year to help get his son onto Arizona's Medicaid system when they moved to Scottsdale in 2022, and it took time to set up food benefits. But he and his wife, who are retired, say they don't have the means to support his son fully.",
      "\u201cShould I expect the government to take care of him?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I do expect them to have humanity.\u201d",
      "About 71 million adults are enrolled in Medicaid now. And most of them \u2014 around 92% \u2014 are working, caregiving, attending school or disabled. Earlier estimates of the budget bill from the Congressional Budget Office found that about 5 million people stand to lose coverage.",
      "A KFF tracking poll conducted in May found that the enrollees come from across the political spectrum. About one-fourth are Republicans; roughly one-third are Democrats.",
      "The poll found that about 7 in 10 adults are worried that federal spending reductions on Medicaid will lead to more uninsured people and would strain health care providers in their area. About half said they were worried reductions would hurt the ability of them or their family to get and pay for health care.",
      "Amaya Diana, an analyst at KFF, points to work requirements launched in Arkansas and Georgia as keeping people off Medicaid without increasing employment.",
      "Amber Bellazaire, a policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, said the process to verify that Medicaid enrollees meet the work requirements could be a key reason people would be denied or lose eligibility.",
      "\u201cMassive coverage losses just due to an administrative burden rather than ineligibility is a significant concern,\u201d she said.",
      "One KFF poll respondent, Virginia Bell, a retiree in Starkville, Mississippi, said she's seen sick family members struggle to get onto Medicaid, including one who died recently without coverage.",
      "She said she doesn't mind a work requirement for those who are able \u2014 but worries about how that would be sorted out. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to determine who needs it and who doesn't need it,\u201d she said.",
      "Lexy Mealing, 54 of Westbury, New York, who was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021 and underwent a double mastectomy and reconstruction surgeries, said she fears she may lose the medical benefits she has come to rely on, though people with \u201cserious or complex\u201d medical conditions could be granted exceptions.",
      "She now works about 15 hours a week in \u201cgig\u201d jobs but isn't sure she can work more as she deals with the physical and mental toll of the cancer.",
      "Mealing, who used to work as a medical receptionist in a pediatric neurosurgeon\u2019s office before her diagnosis and now volunteers for the American Cancer Society, went on Medicaid after going on short-term disability.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine going through treatments right now and surgeries and the uncertainty of just not being able to work and not have health insurance,\u201d she said.",
      "Felix White, who has Type I diabetes, first qualified for Medicaid after losing his job as a computer programmer several years ago.",
      "The Oreland, Pennsylvania, man has been looking for a job, but finds that at 61, it's hard to land one.",
      "Medicaid, meanwhile, pays for a continuous glucose monitor and insulin and funded foot surgeries last year, including one that kept him in the hospital for 12 days.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have afforded that,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have lost my foot and probably died.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- There were funnel cakes, stands of festival bling and American flags aplenty. There were mighty machines of war, brought out to dazzle and impress. And there was the spray of tear gas against demonstrators in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and rolling waves of anti-Trump resistance coast to coast.",
      "In scenes of celebration, protest and trepidation Saturday, masses of Americans cheered for a rousing Army parade like none seen in Washington in generations. Masses more rallied across the country against a president derided by his critics as an authoritarian, would-be king.",
      "On Saturday, the U.S. Army turned 250 and President Donald Trump 79. The double birthday bash energized crowds of well-wishers and military families in the capital while others decried the militarization of city streets \u2014 in Los Angeles, where a federalized National Guard and U.S. Marines remained deployed against unrest, and in Washington for the parade.",
      "In these times, the fault lines of American life were evident.",
      "\u201cOne nation under distress,\u201d read a sign carried in a crowd of 1,000 protesters on the grounds of Florida\u2019s old Capitol in Tallahassee. Forewarned of a heavy state response if the crowd caused any trouble, organizers implored the peaceful protesters to not so much as jaywalk.",
      "Yet, in his Trump 2024 shirt, retired American Airlines pilot Larry Stallard happily lived out \u201cone thing on my bucket list\u201d from his perch on the parade route. Stallard, 82, came from Kansas City for the event. He declared Trump \u201cone of the best presidents in my lifetime\u201d and concluded, \u201cIt's been a long day, but it's worth it.\u201d",
      "Trump's remarks, about eight minutes, were brief for him as he capped the showy parade he had longed for in his first term and, early in his second, finally got.",
      "\u201cThere is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper or Green Beret,\u201d he told the crowd. From Bunker Hill to the mountains of Afghanistan, the president said, \u201cthe Army has forged a legacy of unmatched courage, untold sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Spirited \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests unfolded in cities and towns across the American republic. But in Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz asked people to stay away from anti-Trump demonstrations after the assassination of state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, by a gunman still on the loose.",
      "In Los Angeles, epicenter of days-long protests sparked by Trump's crackdown on immigrants, police on horseback charged a previously calm crowd, firing tear gas and crowd control projectiles. \"We weren\u2019t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,\u201d said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender.",
      "Law enforcement officers in Atlanta deployed tear gas to divert several hundred nonviolent protesters heading toward Interstate 285 in the northern part of the city. In Culpeper, Virginia, one person was struck by an SUV that police say was intentionally accelerated into the crowd as protesters were leaving an event.",
      "In Washington, more than 6,000 soldiers marched in period-by-period uniforms, dating back to the garb of the ragtag Continental Army and the rise of a nation that would become the world\u2019s most potent military power. In the mix: tanks, parachute jumps and flyovers by more than 60 aircraft.",
      "With evening thunderstorms in the forecast, the parade started well ahead of schedule. In the first 40 minutes, it sped through more than 200 years of Army history, from 1775 to 1991.",
      "Vietnam-era helicopters, including the Huey, roared overhead, as did World War II-vintage aircraft. Sherman tanks, used extensively in that war's European theater, rumbled in the procession along with modern machinery. The Army's Golden Knights parachute team jumped early, releasing streaks of red smoke across the sky and making the crowd scream with excitement as they floated to the ground.",
      "At the festival earlier, attendees sported apparel celebrating both the Army and Trump. Vendors moved through the crowd, selling Trump-themed merchandise, while others offered gear commemorating the Army\u2019s milestone.",
      "It was all too much for Wind Euler, 62, who flew from Arizona to join the protesters. \u201cMy father was a Marine in Iwo Jima, and he was a Republican,\" Euler said. \"I think he would be appalled by the fascist display this parade shows.\u201d",
      "In a camouflage jacket and Army baseball hat, Army veteran Aaron Bogner of Culpeper, Virginia, decried how he believes Trump is using the U.S. military to advance a personal agenda. \u201cI think it\u2019s shameful,\" Bogner said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an engineered birthday party. It\u2019s an excuse to have tanks in your streets like North Korea.\u201d",
      "Above all, Bogner said, he came to protest the deployment of U.S. troops in Los Angeles after lawlessness broke out in pockets of the city along with peaceful demonstrations. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand when it became unpatriotic to protest,\u201d he said.",
      "In Atlanta, police yelled \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d and \u201cyou must disperse\u201d into megaphones as they used tear gas to divert protesters off the road. The tear gas caused the crowd to disperse away from the interstate. Two police helicopters flew above as the crowd moved.",
      "Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, used bicycles to corral marchers. After the main \u201cNo Kings\u201d march ended in Charlotte, a second, unpermitted march began, producing a police confrontation.",
      "Officers formed a barricade with bicycles and yelled \u201cmove back\u201d as protesters attempted to march through uptown Charlotte. In response, demonstrators chanted \u201clet us walk\u201d as police continued to shift them back. Protesters also shouted \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and \u201cno more Nazis.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump has long bet that he can scare allies into submission \u2014 a gamble that is increasingly being tested ahead of the Group of Seven summit beginning Monday in Canada.",
      "He's threatened stiff tariffs in the belief that other nations would crumple. He's mused about taking over Canada and Greenland. He's suggested he will not honor NATO's obligations to defend partners under attack. And he's used Oval Office meetings to try to intimidate the leaders of Ukraine and South Africa.",
      "But many world leaders see fewer reasons to be cowed by Trump, even as they recognize the risks if he followed through on his threats. They believe he will ultimately back down \u2014 since many of his plans could inflict harm on the U.S. \u2014 or that he can simply be charmed and flattered into cooperating.",
      "\u201cMany leaders still seem intimidated by Trump, but increasingly they are catching on to his pattern of bullying,\u201d said Jeremy Shapiro, research director at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn places as diverse as Canada, Iran, China and the EU, we are seeing increasing signs that leaders now recognize that Trump is afraid of anything resembling a fair fight. And so they are increasingly willing to stand up to him.\u201d",
      "In the 22 instances in which Trump has publicly threatened military action since his first term, the U.S. only used force twice, according to a May analysis by Shapiro.",
      "Ahead of the G7 summit, there are already signs of subtle pushback against Trump from fellow leaders in the group. French President Emanuel Macron planned to visit Greenland over the weekend in a show of European solidarity. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said the U.S. is no longer the \u201cpredominant\u201d force in the world after Trump's tariffs created fissures in a decades-long partnership between the U.S. and its northern neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage,\" Carney said this past week in French. \"Today, that predominance is a thing of the past.\u201d",
      "The new prime minister added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the U.S. became the global hegemon, a position of authority undermined by Trump's transactional nature that puts little emphasis on defending democratic values or the rule of law.",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran has added a new wrinkle to the global picture as the summit leaders gather to tackle some of the world\u2019s thorniest problems",
      "A senior Canadian official said it was decided early on that the G7 won\u2019t be issuing a joint communiqu\u00e9 as it has at past summits \u2014 an indication of how hard it can be to get Trump on the same page with other world leaders. The White House said individual leader statements will be issued on the issues being discussed.",
      "Speaking last month at a conference in Singapore, Macron called France a \u201cfriend and an ally of the United States\u201d but pushed back against Trump's desire to dominate what other countries do. Macron said efforts to force other nations to choose between the U.S. and China would lead to the breakdown of the global order put in place after World War II.",
      "\u201cWe want to cooperate, but we do not want to be instructed on a daily basis what is allowed, what is not allowed, and how our life will change because of the decision of a single person,\u201d Macron said.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pushed back against Trump's agenda of levying higher tariffs on imported goods, arguing it would hurt economic growth. The Japanese leader specifically called Trump ahead of the summit to confirm their plans to talk on the sidelines, which is a greater focus for Japan than the summit itself.",
      "\u201cI called him as I also wanted to congratulate his birthday, though one day earlier,\u201d Ishiba said.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the summit was an opportunity for Trump to \u201cmend\u201d relationships with other countries so China would be unable to exploit differences among the G7.",
      "She said other foreign leaders are \u201cnot intimidated\u201d by Trump's actions, which could be driving them away from tighter commitments with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe conversations that I\u2019ve had with those leaders suggest that they think that the partnership with the United States has been really important, but they also understand that there are other opportunities,\u201d Shaheen said.",
      "The White House did not respond to emailed questions for this story.",
      "Having originally made his reputation in real estate and hospitality, Trump has taken kindly to certain foreign visitors, such as U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Starmer has sought to keep Trump in line with Europe in supporting Ukraine and NATO instead of brokering any truces that would favor Russia. He has echoed the president\u2019s language about NATO members spending more on defense. But in his Oval Office visit, Starmer also pleased Trump by delivering an invite for a state visit from King Charles III.",
      "The German government said it, too, wanted to send a public signal of unity, saying that while Trump's recent meeting with Merz at the White House went harmoniously, the next test is how the relationship plays out in a team setting.",
      "There will also be other world leaders outside of the G7 nations attending the summit in mountainous Kananaskis, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whom Trump dressed down in the Oval Office.",
      "Italy's Meloni has positioned herself as a \u201cbridge\u201d between the Trump administration and the rest of Europe. But Italy\u2019s strong support of Ukraine and Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on European goods have put Meloni, the only European leader to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, in a difficult position.",
      "Mark Sobel, U.S. chair of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, an independent think tank, said Trump's \u201ctrade policies, backing for right wing European movements, seeming preference for dealing with authoritarians and many of his other actions are alienating our G7 allies,\u201d even if the U.S. president is correct that Europe needs to do more on defense.",
      "But even as other G7 leaders defuse any public disputes with Trump, the U.S. president's vision for the world remains largely incompatible with they want.",
      "\u201cIn short, behind the curtains, and notwithstanding whatever theater, the Kananaskis summit will highlight a more fragmented G7 and an adrift global economy,\" Sobel said.",

      "The barrage of changes Trump has wrought to American culture in the first few months of his second White House residency has ignited the campaigns of Virginia Democrats Jay Jones and Shannon Taylor as they appeal unrelentingly to the most devout swaths of their base ahead of down-ballot primary elections. The primary will also determine the party\u2019s nominations this year for lieutenant governor and some contested seats in the House of Delegates.",
      "In one of only two states electing governors in November \u2014 the other is New Jersey \u2014 the caustic anti-Trump rhetoric could be a hint of what voters nationwide will hear from Democrats in next year's midterm elections, when the stakes will be higher.",
      "Virginia's nominees for governor have been settled by default. Democrat Abigail Spanberger became her party's nominee after running unopposed, and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears was the only contender who gathered enough signatures to be on the ballot. The other statewide races are for attorney general and lieutenant governor, and Democrats in both contests seem to be vying to top each other with anti-Trump rhetoric and caustic ads.",
      "Republicans are not hosting statewide primaries this year, so only Democrats will pick a nominee for lieutenant governor. It's a part-time position that pays about $36,000 a year but is often a stepping stone to higher office. Six Democrats want the job, and most of them have pushed ad after ad on the airwaves and online about their commitment to taking on Trump if elected to the mostly ceremonial role.",
      "In the contest for attorney general, Jones and Taylor are competing in much the same way. Turnout is likely to be sluggish, which means firing up base voters is widely seen as the way to go. The last time a left-wing candidate for governor ran unopposed, roughly 142,000 Democrats voted for an attorney general nominee compared with more than 485,000 this past election cycle.",
      "Still, the AG's race has been spicy, more so when the candidates' criticism isn't directed at each other. Jones and Taylor have lambasted the White House and argued that the administration\u2019s actions should be litigated in court. When they are not lamenting Trump, their attacks are directed toward incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is seeking reelection.",
      "In their respective campaigns, the Democrats argue that Miyares submits to the president by not suing him. They say that sets him apart from more progressive attorneys general across the United States, who are going to court over such things as birthright citizenship and elections. Their main message: A Democrat will take the White House to trial when Miyares won\u2019t \u2014 and saving democracy starts there.",
      "\u201cThe job is to protect Virginians, to fight for them, to work for them, to keep us safe,\u201d Jones said while campaigning in June in Falls Church, Virginia, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he is not going after them.\u201d",
      "Last month, Taylor told a room full of Democratic voters that Miyares would enable Trump\u2019s overreaches in Virginia, and potentially double down on institutions that don\u2019t comply with the president.",
      "Either way, \u201cthe result is the same for Virginians: getting hurt,\u201d she said.",
      "In a wide-ranging interview in May, Miyares said he identifies as a balls-and-strikes Republican. The former Virginia Beach state delegate, elected top prosecutor in 2021, worked to reduce violent crime. He sought settlements from Big Pharma. When he felt President Joe Biden\u2019s administration overstepped, he went to court.",
      "But as Trump was ushered into office for a second term, Miyares entered new political terrain. Unlike most other states, Virginians will elect their attorney general this November, nearly a year after the country voted for the president and his consequential agenda.",
      "Miyares has waded into the political arena. He often spars on social media with progressive prosecutors throughout Virginia for being too lenient in prosecuting criminal cases.",
      "Still, Miyares rebuffed the notion that suing Trump is his top concern. He said the Democrats looking to replace him fail to understand the nature of his position.",
      "The attorney general touted meaningful work his office has shouldered: holding listening sessions for crime victims, designating resources to support law enforcement and beefing up his office\u2019s prosecutions of child support cases.",
      "He flashed his law enforcement badge, tucked within a leather wallet, and described the emblem as a guidepost for being an effective people\u2019s prosecutor.",
      "\u201cThey seem very obsessed with Donald Trump, whereas I\u2019m obsessed with how am I going to keep Virginians safe?\u201d Miyares said.",

      "And on the days in between: a city 2,000 miles from the capital locked in pitched battles over the use \u2014 abuse, many contend \u2014 of federal power and military authority to root out, detain and oust people who the current administration says do not belong.",
      "Today's United States \u2014 its possibility, its strength, its divisiveness, its polarization and fragmentation \u2014 is encapsulated in a single week in June 2025, its triumphs and frictions on vivid display.",
      "As events both planned and chaotically spontaneous play out, many Americans are frantically and sometimes furiously pondering assorted iterations of two questions: What is this country right now? And what should it be?",
      "Consider two quotes from recent days from two very different Americans.",
      "The first came last weekend, during World Pride in Washington, when a 58-year-old gay man from Philadelphia named David Begler summed up what many were messaging in the days leading up to it after months of Donald Trump's increasing attempts to target the LGBTQ community: \"I want us to send a message to the White House to focus on uplifting each other instead of dividing.\u201c",
      "The second came days ahead of the military parade planned Saturday for the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, from the mouth of the president on whose 79th birthday it will be held: \u201cIf there\u2019s any protester that wants to come out, they will be met with very big force,\u201d Donald Trump said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force.\u201d",
      "Among the competing visions of America in 2025: the desire to protest and seek a redress of grievances against the government vs. the desire for control, order \u2014 and a respect for the government and for authority.",
      "The volatile combination of demonstrations and the U.S. military is a potent one, with its most recent roots in the protest movement of the 1960s against the Vietnam War. A young generation that would later be known as baby boomers regularly squared off against police and sometimes the military over U.S. involvement in what was framed as a war against communism in Southeast Asia. Historians give those protesters a fair bit of the credit for that war ultimately ending in 1975. President Jimmy Carter ultimately pardoned more than 200,000 people who had dodged the draft for that conflict.",
      "Then, as now, many in the establishment criticized protesters bitterly, saying they were undermining a nation to which they should be grateful. Questions of loyalty and betrayal were thrown around. The role of the military in quelling civilian protests was bitterly contested, particularly after Ohio National Guardsmen opened fire and killed four students during antiwar protests in May 1970 at Kent State University.",
      "There are echoes of that this week, not only in Los Angeles but now in Texas, where Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the deployment of 5,000 state National Guard troops ahead of the \u201cNo Kings Day of Defiance\u201d against the Trump administration's ongoing immigration raids. And as protesters in Los Angeles taunt the military and say guardsmen should be \u201cashamed\u201d to face off against what they call a just cause, it's easy to wonder: How can patriotism and protest coexist?",
      "Democracy has always been messy and resistant to consensus. That's part of why the national slogan of the United States is \u201ce pluribus unum\u201d \u2014 \u201cout of many, one.\u201d And Washington, D.C., as the nation's capital, has long been the place where the many have come to make themselves known as part of the one \u2014 and to be noticed.",
      "It was where the \u201cBonus Army\" of World War I veterans marched in 1932 to demand their promised postwar payments and be heard in a demonstration that ended violently. It was where the first National Boy Scout Jamboree was held on the National Mall in 1937. It was where the \u201cMarch on Washington,\u201d a centerpiece of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, ended with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s renowned \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. It was where, in 1995, the \u201cMillion Man March\u201d was held to address concerns of the American Black community, and where hundreds of thousands of women came to Washington largely in protest of Trump, just a day after his first inauguration.",
      "It is also the place where Americans remember, where the memorials to World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War sit. It is where the country erected stone shrines in various shapes and sizes to the presidents it most admired \u2014 Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is the site of museums containing some of the most distilled expressions of culture \u2014 from the Holocaust Museum to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum to the National Museum of African American History.",
      "Is it so hard to believe, then, that two events as opposite as World Pride and a military parade unfold here, within blocks of each other, within a week's time? At a politically fractious moment when some families can hardly break bread without political arguments erupting over Trump, Gaza and Israel, immigration and LGBTQ rights, isn't it possible that the weird and downright uncomfortable juxtaposition of these two starkly different events might be the most American thing of all?",
      "Walt Whitman, one of the most famous poets in American history, had this to say about the the diversity of America when he wrote \u201cI Hear America Singing\u201d to underscore that its citizens all contribute to the nation's song: \u201cI am large. I contain multitudes.\u201d",
      "And in one week in June, at a time when the fate of the United States is being discussed in every direction we turn, the capital of Whitman's nation has become a showcase in displaying those messy democratic multitudes to the world. For better or for worse.",

      "Jane said she and Combs split up from Halloween 2023 until February 2024. During the break, she said, she flew on another famous rapper's private jet to Las Vegas, joining the celebrity to celebrate his romantic partner's birthday for a night that included dinner, a stripper's club visit and a hotel room party.",
      "In the hotel room, Jane testified, the rapper who was close friends with Combs made a pass at her amid flirtatious banter, saying he had always wanted to have sex with her. She said she danced in the hotel room, where a male sex worker was having sex with a woman, and at some point Jane flashed her breasts.",

      "The courtroom rules surrounding Jane's testimony were the strictest yet in a bid to protect her identity from becoming common knowledge.",

If the juror does primarily live with a girlfriend in New Jersey, he would be outside the court district and disqualified.",

      "New Jersey widow Sharline Volcy learned this month that she'd been awarded the benefits, more than 3 1/2 years after her husband, Ronald Donat, died while training at the Gwinnett County Police Academy in Georgia.",
      "Volcy said she was grateful for the aid, which will provide some financial security and help pay for her two daughters to go to college. But she said the long wait was stressful, when she was told time and again the claim remained under review and ultimately saw her inquiries ignored.",
      "\u201cThey told me they didn't know how long it would take because they don't have a deadline. That's the hardest thing to hear,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt defeated.\u201d",
      "She said lawyers didn't want to take the case, and a plea for help to her congressperson went nowhere. She said she'd given up hope and was lucky she had a job as an airport gate agent in the meantime.",
      "Volcy's experience isn't unique, and some cases take longer.",
      "As of late April, more than 120 claims by surviving relatives or disabled first responders have been awaiting initial determinations or rulings on their appeals for more than five years, according AP's findings. About a dozen have waited over a decade for an answer.",
      "The program has a goal of making determinations within one year but has not taken steps to track its progress, according to a recent Government Accountability Office report.",
      "But roughly three in 10 cases have not met that timeframe in recent years. As of late late April, 900 claims had been pending longer than one year. That includes claims from nearly every state.",
      "Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill to require the program to make determinations within 270 days.",
      "Over the last year, the denial rate has increased, with roughly one in three death and disability claims getting rejected.",
      "Applicants can appeal to a hearing officer and then the director if they choose, but that isn't common. Many say they can't afford attorneys or want to get on with their lives.",
      "Justice Department officials, who oversee the program, say they\u2019re making complicated decisions about whether cases meet legal criteria.",
      "\u201cDeath and disability claims involving complex medical and causation issues, voluminous evidence and conflicting medical opinions, take longer to determine, as do claims in various stages of appeal,\u201d they said in a statement.",
      "The program started as a simple $50,000 payout for the families of officers who were fatally shot on duty or died as a result of other violence or dangers.",
      "But Congress expanded the program in 1990 to cover some first responders who were disabled on duty, which made some determinations harder to reach. A 1998 law added educational benefits for the spouses and children of those deceased and disabled officers.",
      "Since 2020, Congress has passed three laws making many other types of deaths and disabilities eligible, including deaths related to COVID-19, deaths and injuries of those working rescue and cleanup operations after the September 2001 attacks, and responders who committed suicide under certain circumstances.",
      "Annual claims have more than doubled in the last five years, from 500 in 2019 to roughly 1,200 today.",
      "While many applicants have criticized the increasing delays, the leading group that represents the relatives of officers who die on duty has been silent.",
      "Critics say that\u2019s because the group, Concerns of Police Survivors, has a financial incentive not to criticize the program, which has awarded it tens of millions of dollars in grant funding in recent decades.",
      "The Missouri-based nonprofit recently received a new $6 million grant from the program to for its work with deceased officers\u2019 relatives, including counseling, hosting memorial events, educating agencies about the program and assisting with claims.",
      "The group\u2019s founder and retired executive director, Suzie Sawyer, said she was warned many years ago that fighting too hard for claimants could jeopardize its grant funding.",
      "But current spokesperson Sara Slone said advocacy isn't the group's mission and that it works \u201chand in hand\u201d with PSOB to assist applicants and provide education about benefits.",
      "Lisa Afolayan\u2019s husband died after a training exercise at the Border Patrol academy more than 16 years ago, but she\u2019s still fighting the program for benefits.",
      "An autopsy found that Nate Afolayan died from heat illness after completing a 1.5-mile test run in 88 degree heat, at a high altitude in the New Mexico desert.",
      "The program had awarded benefits to families after similar training deaths, dating back to an officer who died at an academy in 1988.",
      "But its independent investigation blamed Nate\u2019s death on sickle cell trait, a genetic condition that's usually benign but has been linked to rare exertion-related deaths in police, military and sports training.",
      "The program denied Lisa\u2019s claim and her subsequent appeals, arguing the death wasn't the result of heat along and didn't qualify.",
      "The program stood by its denial in 2024, even after a federal appeals court said it may have failed to adequately consider the weather\u2019s role and violated a law barring discrimination on the basis of genetic information.",
      "The appeals court is currently considering Lisa\u2019s second appeal, even as the couple\u2019s two children reach college age.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah.

      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",

      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "summary": "The Beach Boys founder who helped created the \"sun & surf\" soundtrack for the American summer has a new album, a new tour, and an acclaimed film bio, \"Love & Mercy\"",
    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",
      "\"When we got married, I won,\" she laughed.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area, before a partnership with the hospital ended in 2021.",
      "Ross\u00a0is listed as cosigning an open letter during the COVID-19 pandemic that criticized a study that concluded ivermectin was ineffective for treating the disease. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",
      "\"We oppose this fixation on randomized controlled trials at the expense of other clinical and scientific evidence and urge medical policymakers to restore balance to the practice of medicine,\" the letter said.",

      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on Fox News Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",

      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",

      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",

      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0in August that will cost $499. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

      "Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch.

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",

This phase of the conflict will likely last several weeks at least.\"",
      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",
      "One concern is that Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, a strategic channel through which millions of barrels of oil flow each day. For now, that option may be off the table for now, according to Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial.",
      "\"We think this is unlikely for now given Iran's need to maintain oil sales to China,\" Kerr said in an email.",

      "U.S. Steel has said the Nippon deal will allow for new investments in the company's aging facilities, including its Mon Valley Works in the Pittsburgh area. If the deal isn't approved, U.S. Steel has warned it may need to move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh and focus on cheaper ways of making steel than Mon Valley's blast furnaces, putting scores of jobs into jeopardy.",

      "According to a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the lithium-ion battery inside certain \"PowerCore 10000\" made by Anker, a China-based electronics maker, can overheat. That can lead to the \"melting of plastic components, smoke and fire hazards,\" Anker said in an\u00a0announcement.",
      "The company added that it was conducting the recall \"out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety of our customers.\"",
      "According to the CPSC, China-based Anker has received 19 reports of fires and explosions involving the chargers. That includes two minor burn injuries and 11 reports of property damage amounting to over $60,700.",
      "The recalled \"PowerCore 10000\" power banks have a model number of A1263. They were sold online at Anker's website \u2014 as well as Amazon, eBay and Newegg \u2014 between June 2016 and December 2022 for about $27 across the U.S., according to the recall notice. Consumers can check their serial number at Anker's site to determine whether their power bank is included in the recall.",
      "Consumers who bought the chargers are urged to stop using them immediately and contact Anker for a free replacement. Affected customers can also visit\u00a0Anker's website for more information and register for the recall.",
      "To receive a replacement, consumers will need to submit a photo of their recalled power bank that shows its model number, serial number, their name, date and the word \"recalled\" written on the product.",
      "Both the CPSC and Anker note that these power banks should not be thrown directly in the trash or general recycling streams. Due to fire risks, recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries, so it's important to check local guidance.",
      "Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in a range of products, including electronics, appliances, cordless tools and electric bikes, and their usage has been linked to numerous incidents of overheating and fires.",
      "Consumers should stop using products with lithium-ion batteries if they detect an odor, change in color, excessive heat, change in shape, leaking or odd noises, according to the National Fire Protection Association.",

She continues to suffer from difficulty finding words, vision problems and headaches, he said.",
      "Novotny is suing Costco for general negligence, premises liability and products liability. Wyle said his client is seeking millions in damages.",

      "In her complaint, Novotny claims Costco acted negligently by failing to fix the dangerous conditions that led to the alleged incident.

    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",
      "Shares of Boeing fell $10.32, or 4.8%, to $203.59 in early trading.",
      "First crash of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner",
      "The Air India incident represents the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, although the aircraft has been involved in previous investigations.",
      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",
      "\"The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. We regret to inform that, of the 242 aboard, there are 241 confirmed fatalities. The sole survivor is being treated in a hospital,\" the airline\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement Thursday on social media.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",
      "A hull loss can indicate an airplane is completely destroyed or damaged and not repaired, the report said. It can also indicate an airplane is missing and the wreckage hasn't been found.",

On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",
      "After New Hampshire, residents of Washington, D.C., are the nation's biggest tippers. People in the U.S. capital on average tip 12.65% when eating out.",

      "Spending at restaurants and bars has climbed in recent years as Americans swap home cooking for dining out. In 2023, spending on dining out represented approximately 56% of Americans' food budgets, a 13% increase from 2000.",
      "\"Since the percentage of spending on food consumed away from home plunged in 2020 due to the pandemic, there have been three consecutive years of significant growth,\" LendingTree's Schulz wrote.",
      "According to LendingTree's analysis, people eat out the most in the nation's capital. D.C. residents spent an average of $10,291 on dining out in 2023, about $3,500 more than residents in Nevada, the runner up. Illinois, on the other hand, saw the biggest increase in money spent on eating out, with dining expenditures climbing 13.5% from 2000 to 2023.",
      "Below are the top 10 states in per-capita spending on dining out.",

      "With the federal minimum wage for tipped workers set at $2.13 an hour, many workers in service jobs such as waiters, hairdressers and bartenders lean heavily on tips to subsidize their income. Even with tips, they still may not reach the standard minimum wage of $7.25, in which case employers are required to step in and make up the difference, accoriding to the Fair Labor Standards Act.",
      "Tipping in the service industry has recently come into focus with the \"No Tax on Tips\" \u2014 a provision baked into the GOP spending bill that would remove federal taxes from tips for workers who earn less than $160,000.",

      "Consumers are finally getting a break when it comes to egg prices.",
      "Egg prices dropped to $4.55 in May, down 11% from $5.12 in April, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price drop for a dozen Grade A large eggs comes as the effects of a years-long, widespread avian flu outbreak recede and demand for eggs eases, as it usually does this time of year.",
      "\"There are two main drivers behind the drop in prices \u2014 abatement in the conversation about bird flu, and some seasonality in uses of eggs. Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",
      "While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, down from $6.23 a dozen in March, they remain elevated compared with 12 months ago. In May 2024, a dozen eggs cost $2.70.",
      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices began to decrease in March, according to Ortega, and the price drops are now starting to show up at the retail level.",
      "\"There's a bit of a lag before they reach consumers at the grocery store,\" he said.",
      "Yet the bird flu outbreak, which began in the spring of 2022, is not yet entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, Ortega cautioned. \"It's still very much an issue.\"",

      "Scheffler, 28, who is competing in the U.S. Open this week, said Tuesday that he deleted the app after receiving a string of unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance.",
      "\"That's why I had to get rid of my Venmo because I was either getting paid by people or people requesting me a bunch of money when I didn't win. It wasn't a good feeling,\" the 16-time PGA Tour winner recently told reporters, according to CBS Sports.",
      "While he occasionally received small payments after winning a game, Scheffler said he more typically got requests from gamblers looking to cash in if he had lost.",
      "\"I don't remember the most that somebody would send me,\" he said. \"Maybe a couple bucks here or there. That didn't happen nearly as much as the requests did.\"",
      "Ordinary Venmo users may not attract the same attention on the app as Scheffler, but they can still benefit from knowing how to protect their privacy on the payment platform.",
      "Read on for tips on how to navigate Venmo safely.",
      "What should I do if I get an unexpected payment or request on Venmo?",
      "With the proliferation on online scams, Venmo encourages its users to play it safe. If you get a payment from a stranger, Venmo says you should not accept the transfer, but instead contact the app's\u00a0support team.",
      "Likewise, payment requests from suspicious accounts, or people you don't know, should also be declined, the company says.",
      "\"In some cases, you may receive a payment request from someone who appears to be a friend or relative,\" Venmo warns on its website. \"This can be a common scam tactic, so we recommend contacting your friend or family member outside of Venmo to confirm the legitimacy of the request before taking any action.\"",
      "For more information on how to safely use Venmo, the company's\u00a0website\u00a0outlines common mobile payment scams and how to avoid them.",
      "Can everyone see my Venmo payment history?",
      "Paying your roommate for the electricity bill? Others might be able to see that transaction on Venmo, depending on your account settings.",
      "If your profile is public, which is the default setting on the app, then each of your payment transactions will appear on Venmo's main feed, making them visible to anyone online. That includes information on who you're paying, when you paid them and what you're paying them for \u2014 cue the pizza emoji.",
      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",
      "For example, if your account is private and you're making a payment to someone with a public account, the payment will automatically be private, and only visible to you and the recipient.",

      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, John, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer.",

Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing first-degree murder charges for the killings of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",
      "Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally. Authorities found his car on Sunday,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",

John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote, in part. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",

      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask.",
      "A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",

Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in, according to Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendant Drew Evans and Bruley. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",

In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",

Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",

He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",

      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",

      "John Hoffman got out of his final surgery and was \"moving toward recovery\" Sunday night, Walz said.",

      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",

      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Sunday night directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after large protests erupted in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas against the Trump administration's immigration policies.",
      "In a Truth Social post, the president called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \"to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He added that to reach the goal officials \"must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"",
      "\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" the president wrote.",

      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's\u00a0crackdown\u00a0on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News. The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the\u00a0agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he heard from hotel, agriculture and leisure industries that his \"very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them\" and promised that changes would be made.",
      "Opponents of the president's immigration policies took to the streets as part of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations Saturday that came as Mr. Trump held a massive parade in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The parade featured tanks, flyovers and fireworks.",
      "Mr. Trump made the call for stepped up enforcement in Democratic-controlled cities on social media as he was making his way to the Group of Seven economic summit in Alberta, Canada. The first thing on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Mr. Trump met Carney at the White House last month. The rest of the day will consist of meetings with the G7 leaders, and the traditional \"family photo\" of those leaders and a cultural event.",

      "Iran said Israel struck its oil refineries, killed the intelligence chief of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and hit population centers in intensive aerial attacks that raised the death toll in the country since Israel launched its major campaign Friday to 224 people. Health authorities also reported that 1,277 were wounded, without distinguishing between military officials and civilians.",
      "Israel \u2014 widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East \u2014 has aimed its missiles at Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program and military leadership. Israel said Iran has fired over 270 missiles since Friday, 22 of which had slipped through the country's sophisticated multi-tiered air defenses as of Sunday and caused havoc in residential suburbs, killing 14 people and wounding 390 others.",

      "In Israel, at least 10 people were killed in Iranian strikes overnight and into Sunday, according to Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service. It brought the country's total death toll to 14, including a 10-year-old and a 9-year-old in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, since the strikes began on Friday night.",
      "Israel's defense minister warned Saturday that \"Tehran will burn\" if Iran continues firing missiles at Israel.",

      "But Israeli strikes have increasingly extended beyond Iranian military installations to hit government buildings including the Foreign Ministry and several energy facilities, Iranian authorities said, most recently sparking huge fires at the Shahran oil depot north of Tehran and a fuel tank south of the city.",

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran's nuclear program his top priority, brushed off urgent calls from world leaders to de-escalate, saying Israel's strikes so far are \"nothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.\"",
      "Israel's initial assault used warplanes \u2014 as well as drones smuggled into the country in advance, according to officials \u2014 to hit key facilities and kill top generals and scientists.",
      "\"The individuals who were eliminated played a central part of the progress toward nuclear weapons,\" the IDF said in a news release. \"Their elimination represents a significant blow to the Iranian regime's ability to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\"",
      "Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below.

      "A senior administration official told CBS News, \"While there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon.\"",
      "Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, said Saturday that the nuclear talks were \"unjustifiable\" after Israel's strikes, which he said were the \"result of the direct support by Washington.\"",
      "President Trump, who has expressed full support for Israel's actions, offered a stark warning to Iran against retaliating against U.S. targets in the Middle East. He also predicted Israel and Iran would \"soon\" make a deal to end their escalating conflict.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday, Mr. Trump reiterated that the U.S. was not involved in the attacks on Iran and warned that any retaliation directed against it would bring an American response \"at levels never seen before.\"",
      "\"However, we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump took to social media again to predict, \"Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal.\"",
      "The president claimed he has built a track record for de-escalating conflicts, and that he would get Israel and Iran to cease hostilities \"just like I got India and Pakistan to make\" after the two countries' recent cross-border confrontation.",
      "Mr. Trump also pointed to efforts by his administration during his first term to mediate disputes between Serbia and Kosovo and Egypt and Ethiopia.",
      "\"Likewise, we will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran!\" he wrote. \"Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "One of Mr. Trump's allies in the senate, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday morning that Mr. Trump \"sent a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.\"",
      "Above-ground section of Natanz facility destroyed",
      "Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \"critical buildings\" were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. It said there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army's initial assessment, \"it will take much more than a few weeks\" for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \"concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation,\" Cotton said Iran is \"close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons,\" and that's why both Mr. Trump and Netanyahu thought \"things were coming to a head\" with Thursday night's launch.",
      "\"A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month,\" Cotton added. \"And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.\"",

    "story": [
      "Surveillance camera footage from the lobby of a building down the street from the U.S. Capitol provided a break in the three-year search for the person who was extorting a young man from Buffalo, New York.",
      "Cross Cole, a 21-year-old citizen of Ghana, who is linked to a 2022 stay at a rental property in Washington, D.C., was charged last week with the sextortion scheme.",
      "Cole's arrest is part of a growing wave of such cases nationwide and illustrates the complicated and international nature of these attacks.",
      "Sextortion, in which schemers threaten to release illicit photos of victims unless the victims pay them, has surged nationwide.",
      "An FBI affidavit reviewed by CBS News said Cole had obtained a naked photo of the victim from years earlier, when the victim was a minor. Prosecutors also alleged Cole had accessed a nude image of the victim's friend, while the friend was also a minor. The victim's email account was hacked, and his social media account security was compromised, federal prosecutors said.",
      "\"The victim sent $200 to the CashApp account but cancelled the payment after speaking with his father,\" Michael Digiacomo, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York, said in a public notice about the case. \"He then continued to receive multiple text messages from the same telephone number that made the threats.\"",
      "The affidavit reviewed by CBS News said agents eventually tracked down an IP address linked to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., that had accessed the victim's account in October 2022. A security camera image in the affidavit allegedly shows Cole entering an AirBNB rental facility at the Capitol Hill address in October 2022.",
      "The affidavit said Cole's\u00a0mother, who is also a citizen of Ghana, had rented a space in the building through AirBNB that month. A judge has ordered Cole to be detained, pending trial. His next court hearing is scheduled for September in Buffalo federal court.",
      "Safety experts and federal law enforcement officials told CBS News that a growing number of these sextortion schemes are being executed by foreign nationals against children and young adults in the U.S. FBI records obtained by CBS News show a nearly 500% increase in reports of sextortion since 2019.",
      "The FBI and safety groups have been trying to raise awareness around cases like Cole's. Targets are increasingly young men. Experts say these victims are less likely to report the incidents.",
      "In some of the newest wave of sextortion cases, schemers lure children and young adults into sharing illicit photos by pretending to be someone who's about the same age. In other cases, including the one described in the charging documents against Cole, suspects are accused of hacking into the social media accounts of victims to obtain the illicit images.",
      "\"These cases are like something we've never seen before,\" said Lauren Coffen, director of the Exploited Children Division at the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "\"We are used to people being able to reach out and engage and chat with children for sexual reasons. They wanted the images, they wanted to be able to maybe meet up,\" Coffen told CBS News. \"Now, they want money. And that's a totally different motivator than what we're used to seeing in exploitation.\"",
      "\"People have no idea how targeted our teenage boys are right now,\" Pauline Stuart told CBS News.",
      "Stuart's son, Ryan Last, died by suicide hours after a sextortion scheme was threatened against him in 2022. The Justice Department says Last's death showed the pervasiveness of international criminals in sextortion schemes. In an announcement in May, the department said four men in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire had been arrested on criminal charges related to their alleged role in an international sextortion scheme that targeted thousands of victims, including Last.",
      "\"The sad reality is this is not an uncommon event,\" said Digiacomo, whose office is prosecuting Cole's case. Though he would not comment on the details of the Cole investigation, Digiacomo said the pervasiveness of sextortion cases is troubling and largely unrecognized by some parents.",
      "\"Oftentimes in these cases, there are very young victims,\" Digiacomo told CBS News, \"The perpetrators will say 'Just send me the pictures and I'll leave you alone.' And the victims think (sending money) is the easy way out or the only way out.\"",

      "Huge, boisterous crowds marched in New York, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles, some behind \"no kings\" banners.",
      "Thousands of protesters across L.A. \u2014 where demonstrations have occurred in the past week over immigration raids \u2014 were largely peaceful throughout the day, but police issued a dispersal order near the city's downtown federal building after the crowd allegedly started throwing objects at officers.",
      "Police deployed smoke and ordered everyone to leave the area at roughly 3:55 p.m. local time. Aerial footage shows officers detaining several people, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "The gatherings were timed for the same day Mr. Trump will be attending a\u00a0military parade\u00a0in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, and amid heightened tensions with National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to counter anti-ICE protests there.",
      "Saturday morning, Minnesota officials canceled all of the state's \"No Kings\" protests after\u00a0Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0and her husband were killed and state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded in politically motivated shootings targeting the Democratic lawmakers overnight.

      "\"So what do you say, Philly?\" Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \"Are you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\"",
      "An estimated tens of thousands joined the \"No Kings\" demonstrations throughout Portland, Oregon, according to Portland police, but hours later, the city's police\u00a0declared a riot for several hours during a protest outside the ICE building. Portland police said in a release early Sunday that three people were arrested near the ICE facility for \"criminal actions, and not constitutionally protected free speech.\"",
      "The demonstrations come on the heels of protests flaring up around the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that ramped up last week, with Mr. Trump ordering National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles as some protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire.",
      "Democratic governors called Mr. Trump's Guard deployment \"an alarming abuse of power\" that \"shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\"",

      "Protesters have called for Mr. Trump to be \"dethroned\" as they compare his actions to those of a king and not a democratically elected president.",
      "According to a statement by the organizers, the No Kings Day of Defiance is intended to reject authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics and the militarization of the country's democracy.",
      "The event was promoted by Walmart heiress Christy Walton, herself a billionaire, in a full-page advertisement she took out in The New York Times last Sunday. No Kings Day merchandise has cropped up for sale on Amazon, Temu and other online retailers.",
      "Organizers timed the protests to counter the Army's 250th anniversary celebration, which included a military parade involving hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers. The parade has been estimated to cost between $25 million to $45 million, The Army expected the parade to attract as many as 200,000 people.",
      "\"The flag doesn't belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,\" the \"No Kings\" website says. \"On June 14th, we're showing up everywhere he isn't \u2014 to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 15, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events. When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight, unless Iran hits the U.S. Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, what the President said in his overnight post was a clear message to the Ayatollahs, that if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the US military in a way no one's ever seen. That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"death to America,\" it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well. And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months. But as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's- Iran's stubbornness that ended them. President Trump was clear about that, and he is still clear that there is time if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the line, he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He hasn't said that--",
      "SEN. COTTON: But he- well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment. He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world. And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SEN. COTTON: So far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years, or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel. Now he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament, and he has said that that can happen still through a deal, I don't think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SEN. COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table. I think now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think the strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain. It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But should they?--",
      "SEN. COTTON: --to protect our own interests. I'll simply say this, it is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000 pound penetrating munitions. But as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve, and I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon, and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003. Was there more recent US intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb? Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But that's not weaponization, you know that--",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- They are- they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons. Now that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then if you want to use a missile, obviously you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies. So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we- things that were coming to a head. A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month. And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But why Thursday night?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, as President-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- There seems to be a difference in this--",
      "SEN. COTTON: --Well as President--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --idea of a sprint.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, as President Trump said on Friday morning that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal. That was day 61--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And he scheduled talks on day 63 you know that. I mean, this was a, this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SEN. COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61 the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with him. But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though it- it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran. Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SEN. COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program, which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Right. This would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well on Iran not having a nuclear weapon. We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon. And presidents have said for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it didn't act on it, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations--",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- But in Israel, we are helping- we're--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Do you- but do you share the President's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the President has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it. Should they get it now?",
      "SEN. COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face. Remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well. In this moment of tension to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself. On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement. I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their work sites. And whatever work site it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SEN. COTTON: I don't think we should pull back on any kind of enforcement at all. I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, which could impact the economy?",
      "SEN. COTTON: We should not declare any industry or any work site that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date. As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California. You referred to it as the threat from the radical left , an overwhelming show of force to end the riots, and talked about communities being terrorized. Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes, when you see left wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks, and unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order, the next step is to call in the National Guard, and if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the President has to federalize them. We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent, yesterday, they fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SEN. COTTON: The LA police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Jun 2025 15:26:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California was briefly detained last week after being forcibly removed from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California warned Sunday that if he, as a U.S. senator, could be forcibly removed from a Department of Homeland Security news conference, \"don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there\" to others.",
      "\"If that's how this administration responds to the senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of, but what they are doing when the cameras are not there, to people without a title like United States senator, that cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better,\" Padilla said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Padilla was removed on Thursday from a news conference by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles amid ongoing immigration raids and protests in the city. Last week, President Trump overrode California Gov. Gavin Newsom and sent in the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell the protests.",
      "Noem was describing what she called the \"burdensome leadership\" of California's governor and the mayor of Los Angeles, when Padilla interrupted and attempted to ask a question before being pushed from the room. He could be heard yelling, \"I'm Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,\" as he was forcefully escorted out of the room.",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill and throughout the country expressed shock at the treatment of a U.S. senator, and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the incident \"horrible\" and \"not the America I know.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she \"wished that he would have reached out and identified himself and let us know who he was and that he wanted to talk.\"",
      "Los Angeles was among more than 2,000 cities nationwide that held protests Saturday against the Trump administration, which in L.A. resulted in police dispersing the crowd. Los Angeles Police Department officers said on a post to X that \"people in the crowd are throwing rocks, bricks, bottles and other objects\" when the march passed by the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Newsom on Saturday accused the Defense Department of using old images to promote the military presence.",
      "Padilla said Sunday that last week, he was supposed to have his own briefing with the same representatives of Northern Command in the same building as Noem's media event, but it was delayed due to the news conference. He said he asked if he could listen in because he does not feel Noem has provided \"substantive answers\" to questions to Congress, whether it be in formal requests via letters or in testimony before Congress.",
      "\"So to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it,\" Padilla said.",
      "Padilla said he wanted to ask about \"their justification for the federalization of the National Guard,\" which he considers \"not only not necessary, but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles.\"",
      "He also said he wanted to ask about the increasing number of stories of people who are \"undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families\" being targeted for deportation.",
      "Padilla said a \"key question\" he had for Noem was about how many criminals are being deported, which is who the Trump administration has claimed to be targeting.",
      "\"Of course, she had no data, had no answer,\" Padilla said. \"Promised to follow up. I hope, we'll see.\"",
      "Padilla added that it was the same reaction when he had the \"audacity to try to ask a question as a senator of a Cabinet secretary.\"",
      "\"The vast majority of people in that room knew who I was,\" Padilla said. \"I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard member. It's the Los Angeles press corps. It said United States Senate on the chest of my polo.\"",
      "Noem told reporters afterward that she and Padilla met after the incident and had a \"very productive\" conversation.",

This image from the state senator's home security camera appears to show the suspect wearing a full face mask, what looks like a police uniform, and tactical vest. This happened at around 2:00 a.m.",
      "Around 2.5 hours later, during a precautionary safety check at Representative Hortman's home, officers spotted the suspect walking out the front door. He opened fire and then ran away. Police say he left behind a car equipped with flashing white and yellow lights and a police license plate.",
      "Inside were leaflets reading \"No Kings,\" a manifesto listing more than 50 possible targets, including abortion clinics, pro-abortion rights advocates, and other lawmakers from states beyond Minnesota.",
      "(End VT)",
      "LILIA LUCIANO: A man who shared a home with a suspect told reporters that he's a Christian, that he does not like abortion, but that he didn't seem really angry about politics, at least not lately.",

Overnight, he vowed in a social media post that, if the U.S. was attacked in any way by Iran, that the \u2013 quote \u2013 \"full strength and might of U.S. armed forces would come down at levels never seen before,\" and then seemingly offered to negotiate a deal between Iran and Israel.",
      "We go now to Holly Williams, who is at Iran's border with Iraq.",
      "HOLLY WILLIAMS: Here in the Middle East, Iran has accused the U.S. of being complicit in Israel's attack and has threatened to target American military bases and ships if the U.S. blocks Iranian strikes on Israel.",
      "But the U.S. has already done that with air defense systems and a warship, according to a U.S. military official. There are around 40,000 American troops in the Middle East, a powerful presence that aims to protect U.S. interests, including trade routes.",
      "But if Iran did try to strike American forces, the roughly 2,500 U.S. troops here in Iraq could be the most obvious target, since they're right next door. Iran previously targeted U.S. forces in Iraq with ballistic missiles back in 2020 in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force.",
      "No U.S. service members were killed on that occasion. Since then, a series of shifts has reshaped the Middle East and weakened Iran and its proxies, the war in Gaza, Israel's decimation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, the collapse of the Syrian regime, and now Israel's surprise attack.",
      "If Iran does target American forces this time, it would be extremely risky, because it will likely draw a sharp response from the U.S., when Iran is already under attack.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Holly Williams reporting from the Iraq-Iran border.",
      "And we're joined now in Washington by Senator Tom Cotton, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Good morning, and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know you are staying on top of all these events.",
      "When it comes to what President Trump has said publicly, he seems to be indicating not just that the U.S. had nothing to do with the attack on Iran, but he's saying this is not America's fight unless Iran hits the U.S.",
      "Should it be such a bright line?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, what the president said in his overnight post was a clear message to the ayatollahs, that, if you hit America in any way, whether our troops or our citizens or our ships, for instance, then you're going to feel the full force and strength of the U.S. military in a way no one's ever seen.",
      "That's a clear deterrent message, setting aside the threat that the nuclear program poses to Israel and to the United States, because, let's remember, the Iranian regime has been terrorizing Americans. It's killed thousands of Americans. It's taken them hostage. It still chants \"Death to America.\" And it's building missiles that can strike not just our troops or our friends in the region, but soon enough here in the United States as well.",
      "And that's why President Trump has been consistent for his 10 years in political life that we cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow them to have a path to a nuclear weapon with uranium enrichment. That's the deal that he was trying to negotiate for the last two months.",
      "But, as he said early last week, Iran was simply too stubborn. They weren't willing to come to the table and negotiate. And I have to disagree with the reporter who said that Israel strikes in Iran ended those negotiations. It was Iran's \u2013 Iran's stubbornness that ended them.",
      "President Trump was clear about that. And he is still clear that there is time, if they want to come back to negotiate an end to the uranium enrichment program, that he would accept that. But he's given them chance after chance, as he said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, in terms of the line he's drawing on military force, should the U.S. involvement be purely defensive and deterrent, or should the U.S. be willing to be engaged in these military operations?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't think he's drawn that line. He's been very clear that all options remain on the table to defend our own people, to support Israel\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He hasn't said that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But he \u2013 well, he said that for 10 years, and he said it for months leading up to this moment.",
      "He said that Iran can make a deal and live happily without death, or there will be bombing. So, I think he's appropriately kept all options on the table. He made clear in the early days of this conflict, on Thursday night and Friday morning, that we back Israel to the hilt. There's almost 700,000 Americans in Israel at any time. So, of course, we're going to protect Israel, and that we have the best military technology in the world.",
      "And he said that he has proudly provided Israel with those weapons, both in his first term and in this term as well. So, we back Israel to the hilt all the way. But he's appropriately keeping all options on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's emphasizing again and again, this isn't us. This isn't America. This isn't an American operation.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: So, so far in this operation, we have not been involved in offensive strikes. We've been involved in other ways, through our provision of Israel with weapons over the years or our defense of Israel and its citizens and our citizens in Israel.",
      "Now, he has said his objective remains the same, which is Iran's nuclear disarmament. And he has said that that can happen still through a deal. I don't think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He prefers diplomacy.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And he would like Iran to come back to the table, I think, now that Iran sees that Israel and America mean business\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 and surrender its enrichment capabilities voluntarily. If that doesn't happen, though, I think these strikes are going to continue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to the point, if it's really about destroying the nuclear program that Iran has, you know this very well, that there's this underground facility at Fordow, very deep, under a mountain.",
      "It's long been assessed that only the U.S. has the capability with a bunker-buster bomb to take it out. Should the United States offer that kind of massive ordnance penetrator to Israel to finish the job?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I'm not going to speculate about the methods that the United States or Israel might use\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should they?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 to protect our own interests.",
      "I will simply say this. It is, as you say, widely known that Israel does not have heavy bombers. It doesn't have those 30,000-pound penetrating munitions. But, as we saw with Hezbollah last fall, as we saw in Iran on Thursday night, when the Mossad had infiltrated officers and agents and manufactured drones in Iran, Israel has more than a few tricks up their sleeve.",
      "And I wouldn't be surprised if Israel has other cards yet to play.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to differences in intelligence assessments, the U.S. intelligence that was made public in March said at the time the U.S. does not assess Iran's building a nuclear weapon and that the supreme leader has not reauthorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended back in 2003.",
      "Was there more recent U.S. intel sharing or intel indicating that there was some kind of sprint for a bomb?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that seems a very different assessment from what Israel's claiming.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, unfortunately, Iran enriched a lot of the uranium to near weapons-grade over the four years of the Biden administration. And they\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not weaponization. You know that.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: They are \u2013 they are close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons.",
      "Now, that's not the only step to having a weapon. You also have to have the weapon design. We've seen indications that Iran is once again exploring those weapon designs. And then, if you want to use a missile, obviously, you have to marry up the warhead to the missile. But Iran has other delivery methods as well, through terrorist proxies.",
      "So I think that's one of the reasons why both President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu thought we \u2013 things that were coming to a head. A second reason is, Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium-range to target Israel and short-range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month.",
      "And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but why Thursday night?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There seems to be a difference in this idea of a sprint.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, as President Trump \u2013 well, as President Trump said on Friday morning, that he had given Iran 60 days to make a deal.",
      "That was day 61.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And he scheduled talks on day 63. You know that.",
      "I mean, this was a \u2013 this wasn't really a hard deadline.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: He gave them 60 days. On day 61, the strikes began.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Day 63, Steve Witkoff wanted to meet with them.",
      "But if this was a covert race to weaponize, though, it \u2013 it raises questions here, because it appears President Trump's offer is to negotiate with the existing regime that is in place in Iran.",
      "Do you support a deal with the existing regime in Iran to stay in place? Do you support his push for diplomacy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: President Trump has always said his goal is to end Iran's nuclear weapons program\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: \u2026 which means the surrender of its uranium enrichment capability.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this would be offering them a lifeline, wouldn't it?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it would be protecting our interests and securing Israel's interests as well in Iran not having a nuclear weapon.",
      "We've seen what happens when they don't have nuclear weapons. They're deliberately targeting civilian areas in Israel. We've seen their campaign of terror against Americans over the decades. That's why we can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: And presidents have said \u2013 for 20 years, presidents have said that. George Bush said it, didn't act on it. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, frankly, aided and abetted Iran's nuclear program. Only Donald Trump has drawn that line and is willing to enforce that line.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not enforcing that line. It is Israel that's bombing. As you just said, the United States is not involved in these offensive operations.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But, in \u2013 in Israel, we are helping \u2013 we're help\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 but do you share the president's assessment that the way to finish this is through negotiating with the existing regime that the Israelis have called for the Iranian people to rise up against?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think there's multiple ways to eliminate Iran's enrichment capability. They are today what they were Thursday morning, before these strikes started. As the president has said repeatedly, they can make a deal, or there's going to be bombing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move to some domestic issues, but, very quickly, I know in the past, you have said that former officials who have a direct threat against them from Iran should continue to receive security. President Trump pulled it.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get it now?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We should probably revisit the threat that all persons face \u2013 remember, President Trump faced assassination threats from Iran as well \u2013 in this moment of tension, to ensure that no one who worked for President Trump in the first term or works for him now could be the target of Iranian agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that security detail was pulled by the president himself.",
      "On immigration, the Trump administration has decided to pull back its policy a little bit. They are pausing raids on farms, hotels and restaurants. Arkansas has a lot of agricultural business in your state. Do you support this decision?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think we need to have robust worksite enforcement.",
      "I don't think ICE is going to show up at one or two restaurants where they have an illegal migrant working. Usually, it's unscrupulous employers who have large numbers of illegal immigrants working in their worksites. And whatever worksite it is, whatever industry it is, ICE has to be able to go and enforce our immigration laws and remove illegal immigrants.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president has pulled back from that. That was the change in policy last week when it came to farms, in particular.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I don't \u2013 I don't think we should \u2013 I don't think we should pull back to any \u2013 on any kind of enforcement at all.",
      "I think worksite enforcement in all industries needs to be able to move forward. And I think ICE agents on the front lines need the support of political leadership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You would want more enforcement, including in manufacturing, including in construction, where it could impact the economy?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we should \u2013 we should not \u2013 we should not declare any industry or any worksite that uses large numbers of illegal immigrants off-limits for enforcement of federal law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about the enforcement to date.",
      "As you know, there has been outcry. We've seen protests across the country because of the enforcement policies. You wrote an op-ed supporting President Trump's decision to send in federalized National Guard troops and active-duty Marines to California.",
      "You referred to it as \"the threat from the radical left, an overwhelming show of force to end the riots,\" and talked about communities being terrorized.",
      "Given the amount of tension in the country right now, is that really the language to use?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, when you see left-wing street militias who are throwing bricks and frozen water bottles at police officers and shooting them with fireworks.",
      "And, unfortunately, you have mayors and governors in some places that won't allow police to maintain order. The next step is to call in the National Guard. And if the governor won't call on the National Guard, then the president has to federalize them.",
      "We always hope that the local police are allowed to do their job and have sufficient numbers to do their job to maintain order and protect innocent life and property. But, if they can't, or they're not allowed to, the National Guard has to be on scene to restore civil order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: LAPD says they were handling when things turned violent yesterday. They fired rubber bullets, but they said they had it under control.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The L.A. police chief said last weekend that his forces were overwhelmed, and they couldn't manage the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by two senators in a rare bipartisan interview, Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal. They're co-sponsors on legislation to put secondary sanctions on Russia.",
      "Good morning to you both.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Good morning.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to that conflict in a moment, but starting here on the Middle East, Senator Graham, you said you believe it's in America's interest to go all in to help Israel finish the job.",
      "It sounds like you mean offensive support.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So, the worst possible outcome for the world is for the Iranian nuclear program to survive after all this. How do you destroy their program? Through diplomacy \u2013 I prefer that \u2013 or through military action.",
      "If diplomacy is not successful, and we are left with the option of force, I would urge President Trump to go all in to make sure that, when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program. If that means providing bombs, provide bombs. If that means flying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bunker-busting bombs?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Whatever bombs.",
      "If it means flying with Israel, fly with Israel. The worst possible outcome for the world is to take the Iranian nuclear program on and leave it standing. That will be a disaster.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, what's your view? How involved should the U.S. get?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Let's begin with the basic proposition that ought to motivate American policy, as well as the world.",
      "A nuclear-armed Iran is a unacceptable threat to the world, not just to Israel, but to the United States as well. And I support Israel's right to defend itself against this existential menace.",
      "I'm very concerned right now about United States personnel in the region, our service men and women, but also the civilians that are there. I'm getting phone calls from families in Connecticut who are deeply worried about their children who are there, about the hostage families.",
      "I support the president's effort to prioritize diplomacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk more about this after the commercial break, so please stay here with us.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can subscribe to our podcast. It's available on all platforms, including Apple Podcast, Spotify and Amazon.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return now to our conversation with Senators Graham and Blumenthal.",
      "Senator Blumenthal, before we get to Ukraine, I just want to tie up the Middle East here.",
      "You know, the defense secretary was testifying to Congress this week, and he said he's moved equipment meant to counter drones in Ukraine over to the Middle East now because of this escalation.",
      "What more is needed to protect U.S. personnel?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We need to move assets. And we've done so. Not only to protect U.S. personnel, but also to enable Israel to defend itself against Iran's retaliation.",
      "But I think that the president is right to try to bring the two sides together. There is a deal that's possible here if Iran were to abandon its effort to build nuclear bombs that endanger not only Israel but the entire regional stability, because all the other Arab nations are going to have nuclear weapons if Iran does as well. But Americans have no interest in a forever war. And so I think we need to be mindful about the priority of diplomacy here and bring the two sides together, as well as protecting U.S. personnel.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator Graham, the \u2013 the thing with diplomacy is that the Israeli prime minister is calling for the Iranian people to rise up against the regime.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A regime he says is calling for the destruction of his state.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't really seem like there's a compromise there if it's truly this existential. Is this just leading us towards the outcome you say, which is the United States getting involved in military conflict?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, this \u2013 I would love for the regime to fall. If you don't, if you want this regime to stay in power, you're wanting people to oppress the Iranian people. You want people to threaten their neighbors, to \u2013 to be the largest state \u2013 who wants the largest state sponsor of terrorism to stay in place? But regime change is not the policy of the United States. It is not the purpose of this attack yet. But if there is one attack on an American anywhere in the Mideast by Iran, then you'll get regime change.",
      "So, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with a non-negotiable part of the deal. They can't have a nuclear program that can make a bomb. Diplomacy is preferred, as Dick says, but force may be the only option. And I said as clearly as I can say, if diplomacy fails, Mr. President, President Trump, you've been great, help Israel finish the job. Give them bombs. Fly with them if necessary.",
      "I cannot stress to you how \u2013 if you want to get Russia right, you want to make China be better, you want to convince international terrorism we mean business, you've got to finish the job with Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any willingness to negotiate. So far, we haven't seen much.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, that's a big mistake on Iran's part. It's not on President Trump's. If we don't have notions, it's not because of Trump, it's because of the ayatollah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or \u2013 you can't necessarily bomb someone into concessions that they were not willing to make, right? I mean here \u2013 is there \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I don't think they have any desire to make concessions.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: If \u2013 if Iran miscalculates now \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It will face the consequences. But there is a road to a deal. President Obama reached a deal. Far from perfect. President Trump ripped it up. If it were in effect, maybe we could have stopped the Iran nuclear buildup, which has occurred. They're close to ten bombs now. But there is the possibility of diplomacy. In the meantime, the United States ought to provide the means for Israel to defend against this Iranian retaliation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify, when you say close to ten bombs, you mean they would have enough nuclear fuel? But as far as we know, from the U.S. assessment, they hadn't made the political decision to turn that into a weapon. We didn't hear that from the Senate Intel chair when I asked that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What purpose do you need \u2013 if I may, what purpose is there for enriched uranium at 60 percent other than making a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Leverage (ph).",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why do you have 900 pounds of this stuff if you don't want to make a weapon?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, the \u2013 the assessment was they wanted the leverage, right? So \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, right, whatever.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the bipartisan work you are both doing, if I can.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By the way \u2013",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Finally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran and \u2013 Iran and Russia \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. And we're bipartisan on this. We say the same, actually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 you are. Iran and Russia work together.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And, you know, if I can just add one more point about Iran \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Because we're going to talk about Russian sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think we ought to strengthen sanctions against Iran, which is a non-kinetic, a peaceful means of exerting pressure. I'm hoping that perhaps Senator Graham and I \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I will be your wingman. We'll write the bill right here on television. China, if you're listening, stop buying Russian oil and stop helping the Iranians. You would make the world a safer place if you would stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They buy it because it's cheap, though. And they \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, they \u2013 well, you know \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that \u2013 but right now \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well then, they should play a price for propping up Putin's war machine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, sure.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We should crush their economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, tell me about that. So, with the \u2013 the sanctions bill that you all are working on, you have a veto-proof majority.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just need the Senate leader to put it to a floor and you need the president to tell him go. What are you waiting for?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think the president should call on the Senate to vote approval of the Russian sanction bill literally tomorrow. He's on his way tonight to the G-7 meeting. He will be sitting across from world leaders. Right now, very bluntly, the perception may be one of weakness in terms of America's position on Ukraine. He can be there in a position of strength. This bill will pass overwhelmingly. It has 84 evenly divided co- sponsored. It will get 90 votes on the floor of the Senate.",
      "This moment cries out for presidential leadership. There is an urgency here. We've seen the neighborhoods decimated, people killed in their sleep, women and children shot in the back of their heads and buried in mass graves in Bukha. Children who are kidnapped and re-educated, 20,000 of them, behind Russian lines. These atrocities are ongoing. And the people of Ukraine are bleeding and dying.",
      "So, I am hoping that the president will affirmatively show leadership here and call on the Senate to vote. The majority leader could do it tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We have some technical issues to work out. But I really think the moment has come for President Trump to call on the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, President Trump tweeted yesterday that he did speak to Vladimir Putin, who called very nicely to wish me a happy birthday and talk about Iran.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said they're going to speak again this week.",
      "President Trump has put sanctions on Iran while talking to Iran. Why won't he put sanctions on Russia while talking to Russia?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We have sanctions on Russia. He \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not new Trump sanctions. You know that.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Just \u2013 so, I find it odd. So, my Democratic friends are holding him back when it comes to Iran. We appreciate you trying to do diplomacy. What am I saying? Do diplomacy with Iran until it doesn't work. What am I saying with Russia? I don't mind you \u2013 I don't care if you go on vacation with Putin. I don't care how it ends. I want the war to end so we don't start new wars. I want our \u2013 Ukraine surviving when the war ends. I want Putin not to be overly rewarded for the invasion.",
      "To China, if you stop buying Russian oil, cheap, and India, the war machine would grind to a halt. President Trump has tried diplomacy. And I will say this, I talked to him last night, you've made very sincere efforts to get Putin to the table. I think he's playing a game with you and the entire world. It is now time to change the game with Putin.",
      "I talked to President Trump last night. Stay tuned. If we do not have a breakthrough soon, I would expect that these sanctions will move through the Senate and the House. And to China, if you want your economy ruined, keep buying Russian cheap oil. If you want to be a new nation in the eyes of the civilized world, change your behavior regarding Putin and the ayatollah. And until you change your behavior \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: You're going to be seen as a problem, not a solution.",
      "So, these sanctions are coming if Putin doesn't change. And to my good friend Dick, you've been a great ally. If we can't get the ayatollah back to the table, it is now time to end his nuclear program using military force, jointly with Israel if we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: If we get Iran wrong, good luck with Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, the bill that you put forward will put a 500 percent tariff, as I understand it, on imported goods from countries that buy Russia's oil, their uranium, their gas, other products. It would hit China. It would hit India. The U.S. is also trying to negotiate trade deals with them. Is that getting in the way?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: I think there is really no obstacle to our moving ahead with these bone-crushing sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if oil prices spike because of what's happening in the Middle East?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: You know, we are now energy independent when it comes to oil, the United States. Europe has weaned itself off Russian oil. We visited with President Macron, we've talked to Chancellor Merz. Europe is solidly behind these sanctions. And we've incorporated flexibility in this bill based on our national security for a potential waiver where our interests are concerned, unforeseeable or unknowably right now. We've incorporated exceptions for our European allies who are aiding Ukraine in the billions of dollars, giving them a little bit more time to adjust.",
      "This is a carefully constructed bill.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They get 20 percent of their gas from Russia, right?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Can \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: What he says, that there's three categories. If you're not doing business with Russia, you don't have anything to worry about. If you're doing business with Russia but you're helping Ukraine, you have a carveout for 270 days. If you're doing business with Russia and not helping Ukraine, you're screwed. The president can waive part or all of this based on our national interest. But to the people who wonder, should we pay a price for our freedom? We have in the past.",
      "Go to Arlington. Oil prices will go up if we confront Russia through our bill. Oil prices will go up if we try to confront Iran for their nuclear ambitions. But you pay now or you pay later.",
      "If we get Iran right and we get peace with Russia/Ukraine, not only do oil prices come down, the world will be better off. So, this idea of having freedom and not sacrificing never existed, nor does it exist now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I want to ask you as well about what's happening here at home with the protests we have seen around the country and some of them at times turning violent. There has been criticism of Democrats' policies on immigration. Do you think that this confrontation that we are seeing now, between military forces, federalized, and protesters is partly because of what Democrats have done to date?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The use of military, whether it's the National Guard or the Marines, can be inflammatory and provocative. We had protests across the country yesterday that were entirely peaceful. I was at a number of them in Connecticut, in Hartford and Farmington and elsewhere, all around the country. I think this country knows how to do peaceful protest. And the exceptions ought to be handled by the local police and prosecutors locally.",
      "I spent most of my life in law enforcement before I had this job. I was the chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut. Then I was attorney general for 20 years. And the reliance on state and local police I think is well-founded. And I've supported \u2013 in fact, I've introduced a bill that would limit use of the Insurrection Act, would define better what is a rebellion, and compel the president to come back to Congress for approval if he uses this kind of federal force.",
      "So, I think that there are criticisms to be made of immigration policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: In fact, I favor comprehensive immigration reform. We need it. But that is separate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would call on local law enforcement to perhaps stand up more and deal with it at the local level?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: It's the local level where law enforcement happens in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: We rely on state and local police. And that ought to be the way we enforce our laws in this country. And emphasize the importance of peaceful protests, such as we saw yesterday around the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "All right, Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview. Rare, as we said.",
      "We'll be back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Saturday, demonstrators participating in the \"no kings\" movement marched in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., as part of an organized effort to protest President Trump's policies, including recent deportation sweeps. Organizers of the \"no kings\" rally said that over 5 million people participated coast to coast.",
      "Most were peaceful. But in Salt Lake City, at least one person was injured in a shooting during a demonstration. And in Portland, Oregon, local police declared a riot outside an I.C.E. facility for a few hours before that crowd dispersed.",
      "And we're joined now by California Senator Alex Padilla.",
      "Good morning and Happy Father's Day to you.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Thank you. Thank you. Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there and including those who are living a little bit fearful right now because of what we're seeing, these increasingly cruel and extreme immigration enforcement raids. But, nonetheless, they're going to work, trying to provide for their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about your personal experience with some of this. As many of our viewers saw that video of you being briefly detained when you were trying to get a question to the Homeland Security secretary. Their office \u2013 her office later said you spoke for nearly 15 minutes afterwards. Did you get the answer to the question you were trying to ask? And \u2013 and what was it?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, sadly, no. And to a little bit of context here. The reason I tried to \u2013 the reason I was at the press conference, I was \u2013 I was at a scheduled briefing with representatives at Northern Command, just a couple doors down the hall, in the same federal building, when I learned of the press conference. My briefing delayed because the folks I was supposed to meet with were at that press conference.",
      "So, I asked if we could listen in. I was escorted over. And that's what I was doing.",
      "Why? Because for months and months, whether it's in committee, the secretary herself testifying and not providing substantive answers to questions, other representatives of the department, formal letters and inquiries that we've submitted, doing my job as a senator, to get information as part of our oversight and accountability responsibility.",
      "So, to be able to ask a question of the secretary directly, when they offered the meeting after the incident, I took it but, sadly, no, nothing substantive, nothing informative.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She couldn't answer the question or \u2013",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Either couldn't or wouldn't. And \u2013 and, frankly, that says a lot, right, in terms of the type of \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the question?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, among other things, their justification for the \u2013 the federalization of the National Guard, not only not necessary but counterproductive as we've seen this last week in Los Angeles. And also just truth. You know, for all the talk about the focus and targeting of violent criminals, if that's all the Trump administration was doing, there would be no debate. There's no disagreement on that.",
      "But as you're hearing more and more stories of undocumented, long-term residents of the United States who are otherwise law-abiding, working hard, paying taxes, raising families. And, frankly, working in jobs that under the first Trump administration, when the Covid pandemic hit, were deemed essential, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Workers in restaurants, in agricultural fields, in health care, construction, et cetera, that's who's being targeted now, and that's why there's so much fear and \u2013 and terror in communities, not just in Los Angeles but throughout the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vast majority of immigrants in California, we went and we looked at the stats. They are in this country legally. But Pew Research says your state has nearly two million undocumented and they make up about 7 percent of the entire labor force in some of those farming and service jobs that you \u2013 you talked about.",
      "Since the Trump administration this week told I.C.E. to pull back a bit when it comes to enforcement, do you see that as a step in the right direction, and do you know what triggered that decision?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, so I don't know exactly what triggered that decision. I'll take it. Is it a step in the right direction? It's at least a baby step. And let's hope there's more to follow because they're responding to what I and others have been saying for months and what's frankly years, going back to the first Trump administration. You know, you \u2013 you \u2013 you want stats? Let's talk about stats. The \u2013 the state of California, the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, mostly documented, some undocumented. This is the same California that is the largest economy of any state in the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Fourth-largest economy in the world. Not despite the immigrant population, but thanks to the contributions of so many immigrants as a workforce, as consumers and as \u2013 as entrepreneurs. So, again, focus on the dangerous, violent criminals. No disagreement there. But the \u2013 the folks who are otherwise law-abiding, tax-paying and \u2013 and enriching communities, there's got to be a better way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: A pathway towards legalization. A pathway to citizenship for dreamers, farm workers and others.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's \u2013 that is hoping for \u2013 for movement in Congress that would take some time.",
      "I did note it was interesting to see the \u2013 in the House, the Republican Hispanic conference put forth a letter asking for a breakdown of how many criminals were among those actually deported.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And that was \u2013 yes, that was \u2013 and that was one of the key questions I had for the secretary. Of course, she had no data, had no answer, promised to follow up, I hope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: We'll see. And \u2013 and I also want to be clear about this, because when I had the audacity to try to ask a question, as a Senator of a cabinet secretary, that's what happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: And you saw the response. Everybody's seen the video. You know, it wasn't about me. But if that's how this administration responds to a senator with a question, don't just imagine what they're capable of but what they are doing when the cameras are not there to people without a title like United States senator. That cruel, disrespectful treatment of so many people who deserve much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see in our polling \u2013 on the policy front, we see in our polling that there still is broad support for President Trump's mass deportation policy. Our last CBS poll, as of last Sunday, showed 54 percent approval. There was an interesting \"Washington Post\" piece written by David Ignatius that was pretty sharp about Democrats, saying that, \"they've gotten the border issue so wrong for so long, it's political malpractice.\" And that he was basically arguing, Democrats are handing to Trump the confrontation he wanted with the military, citing actions during the first administration.",
      "Do you think that he has a point there?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: No, I think, you know, \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the public approval is so high of deportation.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well \u2013 but details matter. It depends. You know, it depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the same people, you know, do they think we should maintain due process in the United States of America, the answer is overwhelming, yes. Do dreamers deserve better than the limbo that they find themselves in? Overwhelmingly, on a bipartisan basis, yes.",
      "And so, I think it's important to break down three things. Number one, do we need a safe and secure, ordinarily, humane border? Absolutely. No disagreement there. People seeking to come to the United States, whether it's to seek asylum, on work visas, et cetera, we definitely have to modernize that system and be more strategic in those capacities. But we can't forget the millions of long-term residents, people who have been here working, paying taxes, raising families, buying homes, contributing to the strength of our economy, they deserve better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the ranking member on the Senate Rules Committee, which oversees the Capitol Police. What, if anything, can you tell us about the state of security for lawmakers given what's happening in Minnesota?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, look, a lot of questions, a lot of concerns. I work directly with both the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. And they're doing what they need to do to ensure the \u2013 the safety of members of \u2013 of Congress. But I also think it's more than appropriate to step back and say, why are tensions so high, not just in Los Angeles, but throughout the country? And I can't help but point to the beginning of, not just the first Trump term, but the \u2013 the beginning of the campaign. The tone with which the president launched his first campaign for president, served throughout his first term and continues in this term. For a cabinet secretary, during a press conference, to not be able or be willing to deescalate a situation when I was trying to ask a question, that's just indicative of the tone of the administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You wanted her to say, wait a second, I \u2013 I know who he is, calm down, let him go? Is that what you're saying?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: The \u2013 the vast majority of people in that room knew who I was. I was escorted into that room by an FBI agent and a National Guard's member. It's the Los Angeles Press Corp. It said, United States Senate on the chest of my polo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Padilla, thank you for joining us today.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.",

      "Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman\u00a0was shot and killed at her Brooklyn Park home early Saturday morning, according to a report from the Hennepin County medical examiner. Her husband Mark was shot at the home and died at the hospital. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were shot and wounded roughly 5 miles away at their home in Champlin. Both lawmakers were members of the Democratic Party, representing the northwest corner of the Twin Cities.",
      "According to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Boelter stands at 6-foot-1, weighs roughly 220 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen Saturday morning in Minneapolis, wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, dark long-sleeve shirt, light pants and carrying a dark bag.",
      "If anyone sees Boelter, officials urge people not to approach him, and to call 911. He should be considered \"armed and dangerous,\" Superintendent Drew Evans with the Minnesota BCA said. Evans added that investigators believe Boelter is working to leave the Twin Cities area.",
      "\"We still don't know if additional people are involved, but this individual is the one that we're looking as a person of interest right now. But there may be other people with him and we would like to speak to anybody that may have had contact with him at any point in time,\" Evans said.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a photo Saturday afternoon that appears to show Boelter standing outside of one of the lawmakers' homes, wearing a mask and dressed like a police officer.",
      "Authorities said Sunday morning they found a vehicle belonging to Boelter in Sibley County, about 60 miles southwest of where the shootings occurred. An emergency alert sent to residents asked them to lock their doors and secure their vehicles while law enforcement searches the area.",

We are working with our law enforcement partners and using every available resource to locate and apprehend Vance Boelter. We urge anyone with information to come forward\u2014no detail is too small. The public's vigilance is critical in bringing this individual to justice,\" said FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr.",
      "What we know about Vance Boelter",
      "Boelter's known address is a rural home in Sibley County, near the town of Green Isle.",
      "He works as the director of security patrols at Praetorian Guard Security Services. He previously worked as a general manager at a convenience store chain and at a food manufacturer, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "In 2016, Boelter was appointed as a private sector representative to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Council by former Gov. Mark Dayton. He served until 2019, when he was appointed by Gov. Tim Walz as a business member on the Governor's Workforce Development Board. His term ended in January of 2023, according to state records.",
      "Records show Hoffman served on the same 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. The board advises the governor and the state legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce.",
      "In a press conference, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman. Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "He had been living most recently in a home in north Minneapolis, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation.",
      "Officials said Brooklyn Park police arrived at Hortman's home around 3:35 a.m. and found a police SUV with emergency lights on. The suspect then exited Hortman's home and exchanged gunfire with officers before fleeing on foot. Investigators said they believed the suspect was dressed like a police officer.",
      "There was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in Boelter's vehicle. The list named more than 50 individuals, including officials outside of Minnesota, as well as abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",

      "The Trump administration has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.",
      "The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "The scaling back of some ICE operations reflects increased concern among industry leaders that the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide immigration crackdown was hindering their businesses and the broader U.S. economy by spooking their workforce.",
      "It also marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status, regardless of whether they have criminal histories. And it comes amid a vast expansion in immigration arrests across the U.S. that has triggered protests against ICE activity in major American cities, including Los Angeles, where President Trump has deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines in response to instances of violence.",
      "Asked about the catalyst for the sudden decision to limit ICE enforcement, one of the sources said the president was not aware of the scale of the agency's operations.",
      "\"Once it hit him, he pulled it back,\" the source said.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to preview the policy change during a White House event earlier in the week, describing an upcoming \"order\" to protect farms and hotels relying on immigrant workers.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're gonna have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",

      "Mr. Trump came into office in January promising to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. His administration quickly reversed limits on ICE operations put in place by previous administrations and moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants, greatly expanding the pool of those at risk of being arrested and deported.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE arrests have increased sharply, with the agency adopting more aggressive tactics, including efforts to arrest migrants and asylum-seekers attending their court hearings and check-in appointments.",
      "So far in June, ICE has averaged more than 1,300 arrests each day, a more than 100% increase from President Trump's first 100 days in office, when the agency recorded a 660 daily arrest rate, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. On Saturday, ICE was holding more than 56,000 individuals in detention facilities throughout the country, a record high, the figures show.",

      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",

      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an internal memo obtained by CBS News, the Justice Department ordered its 93 federal prosecutors' offices to beef up preparations for criminal cases stemming from unrest in communities across the country over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"Across the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\" the memo said. \"[T]he Department has zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\"",
      "The memo instructs U.S. Attorneys' Offices to \"diligently monitor these enforcement efforts by maintaining regular comms with their DHS and DOJ agency counterparts.\"",
      "The memo added that leadership \"should prepare their offices to provide legal support for operations in their districts. One or two duty [assistant U.S. attorneys] is insufficient. All [U.S. Attorney Office] leadership and the entire Criminal Division should be on standby. There should be no bottleneck of referrals for complaints and legal process.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to \"prioritize\" any requests for search warrants or complaints in these types of cases and \"push out press releases whenever you file charges in these matters.\"",
      "The Justice Department has already filed a series of criminal cases that allege obstruction or criminal activity related to immigration operations, and has vowed to prosecute anyone who assaults officers or interferes with ongoing immigration actions amid protests in Los Angeles and around the country.",
      "David Huerta, a longtime union leader, is charged in Los Angeles with conspiracy. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 7. According to a Homeland Security Investigation officer's sworn affidavit, Huerta sat down in front of a vehicular gate to a staging ground for Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that were ongoing nearby. The complaint alleged he yelled to other protesters to \"stop the vehicles,\" and said, \"It's a public sidewalk, they can't stop us.\"",
      "In a separate case, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey has filed a felony criminal case against Rep. LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat, who was attempting to visit an immigration facility in Newark on May 9. Prosecutors alleged McIver sought to stop federal agents from arresting the mayor of Newark during the confrontation. \"During her continued attempts to thwart the arrest, McIver slammed her forearm into the body of one law enforcement officer and also reached out and tried to restrain that officer by forcibly grabbing him,\" the Justice Department said. \"McIver also used each of her forearms to forcibly strike a second officer.\"",
      "McIver responded to the criminal indictment in a statement: \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "When asked for comment about the new memo to prosecutors, a Justice Department spokesman told CBS News, \"As we've said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 10:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned lawyers have been relegated to what they refer to as the Justice Dept. rubber room.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration swept into the Department of Justice on Jan. 20, it moved swiftly to purge, demote, transfer and otherwise sideline career lawyers not perceived to be team players or sufficiently committed to the MAGA legal agenda.",
      "Amid the upheaval and exodus of longtime federal prosecutors, one quiet 10th floor office in a remote outpost of the Justice Department has come to symbolize the withering impact of changes at the agency. Those who work there call it \"the rubber room.\"",
      "Inside, nearly a dozen of the government's most seasoned civil rights, environmental and national security lawyers have been reconstituted as members of a newly created group called the Sanctuary Cities task force.",
      "At first glance, the job seemed promising \u2014 a legal strike team that would sue municipalities the administration claimed were facilitating the violation of immigration laws, a task force undertaking a top priority for the new Justice Department leadership.",
      "But the more these attorneys looked into it, the more they concluded the task force was a sham, a Potemkin operation that seemed more aimed at stashing away career lawyers than putting them to work on a legitimate legal project, according to interviews with six people knowledgeable about the task force, all of whom painted a similar picture.",
      "Lawyers there have been assigned menial research tasks and left with hours of idle time \u2014 an effort they view as intended to coerce them into resigning, those with knowledge of the task force said.",
      "\"This is a hard thing to talk about,\" said Tom Mariani, an environmental litigator who resigned rather than accept reassignment to the rubber room. \"I can't tell you how much personal distress I feel over how these folks were treated.\"",
      "The term rubber room is an allusion to now-infamous \"reassignment centers\" where New York City officials transferred public school teachers and administrators who some considered burned out or incompetent, but who could not be fired because of union rules. But in this case, those being transferred have been elite veteran attorneys from the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division and the Environment and Natural Resources Division whose performance had not previously been questioned.",
      "For months they did little or no work, were cut off from other Justice Department litigators who were actually working on sanctuary city cases and had no supervisors they could turn to for support, those familiar with the assignment told CBS News. At least four of those assigned to the task force have filed formal complaints with the Justice Department's inspector general alleging waste, fraud and abuse, CBS News has learned.",
      "That office declined comment on whether there is an active investigation into the treatment of the task force lawyers.",
      "None would comment for this story, fearing retaliation from the administration. But public interest lawyers and government watchdogs say their experience stands apart as an example of how callously civil servants who have dedicated their professional lives to public service have been treated.",
      "\"For the first time in modern U.S. history, we are witnessing purely vindictive and retaliatory actions being taken against non-partisan civil servants who simply performed their jobs consistent with law and policy during prior time,\" said Mark Zaid, a Washington lawyer who represents government whistleblowers.",
      "A new president, a new assignment: The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group",
      "The emails began arriving in the third week of January from then-Acting Attorney General James McHenry, landing in the inboxes of some of the Justice Department's most senior career attorneys, notifying them that they were being transferred to the newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group and had 15 days to decide whether to take the new assignment or resign.",
      "Among those told they were being transferred to the task force were the two most senior career lawyers in the National Security Division, George Toscas and Eun Young Choi. Toscas, who was one of the most knowledgeable counterterrorism lawyers in the federal government, took personal leave instead of showing up at the task force offices. Choi, a highly experienced cyber and crypto prosecutor, also took personal leave. Both have since left the department.",
      "Mariani, who was the chief of the enforcement section of the Environment and Natural Resources section, was a 40-year veteran of the Justice Department who had reached retirement age. He said he opted to exit rather than take the new assignment.",
      "Those who did accept the assignment arrived in the isolated offices during what some called a Department of Justice in turmoil, former senior prosecutors told CBS News.",
      "Puzzles and streaming shows",
      "In this environment, several people familiar with the matter told CBS News that lawyers assigned to the new sanctuary cities section felt they had few options. They showed up for their first day \u2014 Feb. 12 \u2014 at a satellite building of the Justice Department known informally as 2Con for its address at 2 Constitution Avenue. Their handler was Kendra Wharton, an associate deputy attorney general who had worked on multiple legal cases involving President Trump before joining the department.",
      "Wharton rarely, if ever, showed up at the 10th floor office at 2Con. Some lawyers said they never saw her at the rubber room in the nearly three months they were on the task force.",
      "In the first few weeks, she communicated with the group on video calls to give them their assignments. On Feb. 13, at 9:30 a.m., Wharton called in from Justice Department headquarters while the attorneys gathered around a monitor. According to a source familiar with the call, she asked them to research the sanctuary city policies in several heavily Democratic states. The lawyers asked if they could contact the Civil Division lawyers handling the litigation in those states, but Wharton told them she was to be the single point of contact.",
      "\"A 10th grader could have done it,\" one source familiar with the work remarked bitterly.",
      "Two weeks later, Wharton asked the lawyers to compile information on three additional states. On March 5, Wharton asked for \"emergency\" follow up on a single city, according to one source. A few days later she added one more blue state to the places she wanted studied.",
      "After that, Wharton received a different mandate, and she is no longer supervising the lawyers, a Justice Department official said. Work in the rubber room slowed to a halt.",
      "\"Having worked around the clock for years, if not decades, the imposed idleness was something I could not get used to,\" said one lawyer who was assigned to the task force.",
      "The lawyers continued coming into 2Con each morning but had to find activities to occupy their time. Some completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows like \"The Last of Us\" and \"Succession.\" One lawyer, Deborah Harris, whose previous job had been head of the Environment and Natural Resources Division's crimes section, could be seen practicing Italian on Duolingo.",
      "Reached for comment, Harris confirmed some details about some of the ways she passed her time in the rubber room but declined to say anything more.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said, \"The Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group is focused on important work to advance top priorities of this administration.\"",
      "Turmoil inside the Justice Department",
      "The rubber room is just the latest in a series of personnel moves that critics of the administration have tracked. Some have been demoted within their own units. Bruce Swartz, the highly respected head of the Office of International Affairs, was notified by email that he was being transferred to the office's training program, a job that fell several rungs below his position. He opted to resign.",
      "Nearly a dozen prosecutors in the Public Integrity Section and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York quit rather than sign onto legal actions they objected to \u2014 such as the decision in February to drop the prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "And at the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office, the interim top prosecutor fired or demoted dozens of assistant U.S. attorneys who had won convictions against hundreds of rioters who assaulted the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Those who did not resign were given jobs typically assigned to junior prosecutors, sometimes referred to as \"baby AUSAs,\" like handling misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court or working in the office's intake section screening cases for prosecution or alternative action.",
      "Harold Koh, Sterling professor of international law and a former dean of Yale Law School, served in the Justice and State Departments under four presidents from both parties. For him, the rooting out of so many lawyers represents more than the personal devastation of these government professionals \u2014 it would be a loss for the American people for years to come.",
      "\"Apart from the shabby, petty treatment of career government officials and the degradation of government institutions, the greatest injury to the American people is the harm caused by the destruction of preparedness for dealing with the next crisis,\" Koh said of this administration.",
      "\"The best and the brightest have always wanted to go to Justice,\" he added, \"but who would want to go to a place like that now?\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",

      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",

    "summary": "NASA wants to evaluate recent efforts to stop a small but persistent air leak in the Russian segment of the space station.",
    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0in August that will cost $499. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",

      "The\u00a0suspect\u00a0in the Minnesota shootings, identified as\u00a057-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was taken into custody\u00a0Sunday night following a two-day manhunt. Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing first-degree murder charges for the killings of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",
      "Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally. Authorities found his car on Sunday,\u00a0CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Nine bullets hit Sen. Hoffman and eight struck his wife, Yvette, and they were both \"lucky to be alive,\" Yvette Hoffman told Sen. Amy Klobuchar in a text message on Sunday.",
      "\"Our family is so humbled by the love and outpouring we've received from everyone. John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote, in part. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "After authorities learned of the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home, Police Chief Mark Bruley said. Hortman's home is about five miles from Hoffman's.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the individual, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he was pronounced dead. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask.",
      "A search of the individual's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers reference the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, statewide \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Suspect Vance L. Boelter in custody",
      "Investigators have identified 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter\u00a0as the suspect in the shootings. He was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night, sources told CBS News. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Investigators had been searching in the area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in, according to Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendant Drew Evans and Bruley. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",
      "He was armed at the time, but Boelter was taken into custody without any use of force, Geiger said.",
      "Police said it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "The face of evil. After relentless and determined police work, the killer is now in custody. Thanks to the dedication of...",
      "Earlier Sunday, an emergency alert sent to residents of Sibley County said authorities found a vehicle belonging to the suspect in Faxon Township, which is roughly 20 miles away, CBS Minnesota reported. Although Boelter's known address is the home in the Sibley County town of Green Isle, a law enforcement source told CBS Minnesota that the suspect had most recently been living at a home in north Minneapolis.",
      "Boelter is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. However, Boelter's roommate told CBS News that, while it was the suspect's \"dream\" to have his own security company, he did not actually have one.",
      "\"It seems he bought the two cars for the security company, but he had no clients and he had no business,\" the roommate told CBS News. \"He had no employees and wasn't doing any security for anyone.\"",
      "In a\u00a0profile\u00a0on the website of Minnesota Africans United, which is no longer active, he is also described as the company's CEO.",
      "In a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0post last month, Boelter said he was \"looking to get back into the U.S. Food Industry\" after spending three years on projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a company where he has been listed as chief executive since 2021. In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in a vehicle believed to be Boelter's that was discovered outside Hortman's home \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "Suspect served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman",
      "Boelter served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman, records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "Boelter was first appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board in 2016 by then-Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Evans said there is \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",
      "\"I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004. She and her husband, John, have two children, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Until Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, a Democrat who represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "On Sunday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar\u00a0shared\u00a0a text message she received from Yvette Hoffman, which said, \"Our family is so humbled by the love and outpouring from everyone.\"",
      "\"John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote. \"...We are incredibly lucky to be alive. We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "John Hoffman got out of his final surgery and was \"moving toward recovery\" Sunday night, Walz said.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter. The Hoffmans' nephew said Yvette Hoffman jumped on their daughter, Hope, to\u00a0shield her\u00a0from the gunfire.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting.\" He said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",

      "\"It happened so quickly\"",
      "\"We almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\" Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \"During this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways, where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents. So we were delayed in getting there because there was just so much damage.\"",
      "Vargo added: \"It happened so quickly and so fast. \u2026 I've been doing this for 35 years. I've seen major floods here in the city and the county. I've never seen anything like this.\"",

      "In a Truth Social post, the president called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \"to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He added that to reach the goal officials \"must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"",

      "\"This means channel owners will be able to share exclusive in-the-moment updates with their most engaged followers, and they'll be able to earn money while doing so,\" said Nikila Srinivasan, vice president for product management at Meta said on a call with reporters.",
      "Channels will remain free for WhatsApp users. However, channel admins will have an option to set a monthly fee within a range if they opt to utilize the subscription model, according to a Meta spokesperson.",
      "Channels will also have the ability to promote their content to get in front of users more easily by buying ads or boosting their channel through Ads Manager. \"Similar to how it works on Facebook and Instagram, businesses decide how much they want to spend based on their objectives,\" the spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "WhatsApp is also planning on integrating ads into the \"Updates\" tab which will allow users to message brands directly if they see a product or service they want, or have a customer service question.

      "\"People really want to chat to businesses on their own terms, and they want to do it in a place where they already spend their time, which is on WhatsApp,\" said Srinivasan.",
      "Srinivasan said the new ad feature will allow businesses, such as Verizon, Wendy's and L'Or\u00e9al to attract more customers directly on the messaging platform.",
      "\"This is going to enable businesses like them to do even more,\" she said. WhatsApp will roll out the new features to a global audience over the next few months, according to Srinivasan.",

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green\u00a0for a birdie that gave him the lead. Needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished his storybook Open by\u00a0holing the longest putt all week at Oakmont\u00a0for birdie and a 2-over 72.",
      "That made him the only player to finish under par at 1-under 279. It gave him a two-shot victory over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland.",
      "And it made Spaun, the 36-year-old Californian who resembles the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris, a major champion in only his second U.S. Open.",
      "\"I never thought I would be here holding this trophy,\" said Spaun, who finished last year at No. 119 in the world with only one PGA Tour title in his career. \"I always had aspirations and dreams. I never knew what my ceiling was. I'm just trying to be the best golfer I can be.\"",
      "It was calamity for so many others.",

      "\"The weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,\" Spaun said.",
      "Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way.",
      "But oh, that finish.",
      "MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead.",
      "Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup.",
      "And then the final putt \u2014 no one made a longer one all week. He was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it drop as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted.",

      "Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood.",
      "\"Unbelievable. What a putt to win. That's incredible,\" he said. \"I'm sad about how I finished, but I'm very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing.\"",
      "Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all \u2014 the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start.",
      "\"After his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,\" Hovland said. \"Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn't expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast.\"",
      "Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's crackdown on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.",
      "The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "The scaling back of some ICE operations reflects increased concern among industry leaders that the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide immigration crackdown was hindering their businesses and the broader U.S. economy by spooking their workforce.",
      "It also marks a significant pivot for the Trump administration, which has vowed to deport millions of immigrants living in the country without legal status, regardless of whether they have criminal histories. And it comes amid a vast expansion in immigration arrests across the U.S. that has triggered protests against ICE activity in major American cities, including Los Angeles, where President Trump has deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines in response to instances of violence.",
      "Asked about the catalyst for the sudden decision to limit ICE enforcement, one of the sources said the president was not aware of the scale of the agency's operations.",
      "\"Once it hit him, he pulled it back,\" the source said.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to preview the policy change during a White House event earlier in the week, describing an upcoming \"order\" to protect farms and hotels relying on immigrant workers.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have maybe what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're gonna have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"We will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the move.",
      "Mr. Trump came into office in January promising to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history. His administration quickly reversed limits on ICE operations put in place by previous administrations and moved to revoke the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants, greatly expanding the pool of those at risk of being arrested and deported.",
      "In recent weeks, ICE arrests have increased sharply, with the agency adopting more aggressive tactics, including efforts to arrest migrants and asylum-seekers attending their court hearings and check-in appointments.",
      "So far in June, ICE has averaged more than 1,300 arrests each day, a more than 100% increase from President Trump's first 100 days in office, when the agency recorded a 660 daily arrest rate, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News. On Saturday, ICE was holding more than 56,000 individuals in detention facilities throughout the country, a record high, the figures show.",
      "While ICE operations have expanded recently, the arrests recorded by the agency remain well below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only.

Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",

      "\"They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. On the 61st day, I said, we don't have a deal.

      "Asked what it would take for the U.S. military to get involved in the Iran situation, the president said, \"I don't want to talk about that.\"",
      "The summit, just outside of Calgary, comes as tensions between Israel and Iran boil over, now in their fourth day of open conflict. A draft G7 statement on Iran has been floated, but Mr. Trump does not plan to sign the statement, U.S. officials said. One U.S. official said Mr. Trump will continue to work toward ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. The draft statement discusses monitoring Iran, calls for both sides to protect civilians, and re-ups commitments to peace, according to the officials.",
      "The meeting of world leaders is taking place as Mr. Trump's aides and top U.S. officials negotiate with these same allies over\u00a0tariffs he's imposed. First up on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was the meeting with Carney, whom Mr. Trump met last month at the White House.",
      "\"The G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership, and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States,\" Carney told Mr. Trump.",

      "\"Putin speaks to me, he doesn't speak to anybody else,\" Mr. Trump said, as he stood next to Carney, who appeared to purse his lips and look away periodically as Mr. Trump spoke about Putin. \"He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8. As I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. It was very insulting.\"",
      "The rest of the day will consist of meetings with G7 leaders, as well as the traditional \"family photo\" of those leaders and a cultural event to cap off the night.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward some U.S. allies as well as the tariffs he's launched on friends and foes alike have made U.S. relationships with some of her allies more uneasy, an undercurrent of the conversations Mr. Trump has on Monday. Mr. Trump's musings to acquire Canada and Greenland have also strained the United States' relationship with Canada.",

      "Carney interjected, using language he believed Mr. Trump as a real estate developer would understand.",
      "\"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" Carney said. \"We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever.

    "story": [
      "Residents in Spain and several other popular destinations in Europe protested against mass tourism Sunday, saying a flood of summer visitors is driving up housing costs in their cities and pushing out locals.",
      "Some of the protesters in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns.",
      "The protests were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\"The squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\" Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \"Barcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\"",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \"bubble tea\" spots.",
      "\"Our lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\"",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \"Everywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\" The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination's historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \"One more tourist, one less resident.\" They stuck stickers saying \"Citizen Self-Defense,\" in Catalan, and \"Tourist Go Home,\" in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel's doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona's main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but Wanda said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit weather.",
      "\"That's lovely, thank you sweetheart,\" she said to the squirter. \"I am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\"",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed a record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain's capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \"Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain's Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \"cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\" which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \"Your Airbnb was my home.\"",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\"I think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\" Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago, recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\"In the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\" he said.",
      "In another strategy, last year, Barcelona's leaders launched a program to replace outdated infrastructure in public schools to address rising temperatures, paid for by a tax on tourists.",
      "\"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News at the time.",
      "But some residents say the program misses the point.",
      "\"The government should be doing this without depending on tourism \u2026 it's public health,\" activist Agnes Rodriguez said. \"If you're coming to Barcelona tonight, to Chicago or to New York, and you're staying in a tourist apartment where a family should be living, you are part of this city changing. You're affecting the life of people living there.\"",

      "Le Bourget, France\u00a0\u2014 Geopolitical tensions roiled the opening of the Paris Air Show on Monday as French authorities sealed off Israeli weapons industry booths amid the conflicts in Iran and Gaza, a move that Israel condemned as \"outrageous.\"",
      "The decision added drama to the major aerospace industry event, which was already under the shadow of last week's deadly crash of Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.",
      "The booths displayed \"offensive weapons\" that could be used in Gaza - in violation of agreements with Israeli authorities, a French government source told AFP.",

      "French official says Israeli \"offensive weapons\" barred amid war in Gaza",
      "French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision during a Monday press conference at the air show.",
      "\"The French government's position was very simple: no offensive weapons at the arms exposition,\" he said. \"Defensive weapons were perfectly acceptable.\"",
      "Bayrou cited the ongoing conflict in Gaza as the rationale behind the ban.",
      "\"Given France's diplomatic choices, in particular the concern, or in any case, very great worries about Gaza, we could not not show that there was a certain distance, which meant that we did not think it acceptable that offensive weapons were in a show like that,\" said Bayrou. \"And as these offensive weapons were not withdrawn [by the Israeli companies], we have temporarily, I hope, closed the stands.\"",
      "At the last Paris Air Show in 2023, Israeli companies - including at least one that was subject to the closure of its stall on Monday - appear to have displayed offensive weapons, including laser-guided bombs and rockets and attack drones.",
      "Aviation news outlet Flight Global reported from the show on Monday that, despite Bayrou's description of a ban on displays of offensive weapons, \"manufacturers from other countries are freely displaying a range of combat aircraft and munitions,\" which it included a display by the French-owned company Dassault Aviation featuring a \"French air force Rafale fighter surrounded by a range of strike munitions.\"",

      "Arkansas' Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders was at the Paris show on Monday and, speaking with reporters, she called the French officials' decision \"pretty absurd.\" Her father is Mike Huckabee, the current U.S. Ambassador to Israel and a staunch backer of the ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza.",
      "The presence of Israeli firms at Le Bourget, though smaller than in the past, was already a source of tension before the start of the Paris Air Show, because of the conflict in Gaza.",
      "A French court last week rejected a bid by NGOs to ban Israeli companies from Le Bourget over concerns about \"international crimes.\"",
      "Local lawmakers from the Seine-Saint-Denis department hosting the event were absent during Bayrou's visit to the opening of the air show in protest over the Israeli presence.",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

The toll was the deadliest yet in the near-daily shootings that have taken place as thousands of Palestinians move through Israeli military-controlled areas to try to reach the food \"hubs\" run by the private contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Two witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire early Monday in an attempt to control the crowds. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military. It has said after numerous previous instances that troops had fired warning shots at what it called suspect individuals approaching their positions.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said 33 Palestinians were killed trying to reach the GHF center near the southern city of Rafah on Monday while another was fatally shot trying to reach a GHF hub in central Gaza. It said four other people were killed elsewhere in the war-torn enclave.",
      "Two Palestinians trying to get food at the Rafah site, Heba Jouda and Mohammed Abed, told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired on the crowds at around 4 a.m. at the Flag Roundabout. The traffic circle, hundreds of yards from the GHF center, has repeatedly been the scene of shootings. The military has designated specific routes to access the food centers, and GHF has warned aid-seekers that leaving the roads is dangerous, but many do in an attempt to get to the food first.",
      "Israel and the United States say the new GHF system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid. GHF says there has been no violence in or around the sites themselves.

      "Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, slammed GHF in a statement on Monday as a \"lethal distribution system\" and lamented that \"tragedies go on unabated\" in Gaza \"while attention shifts elsewhere,\" in an apparent reference to the new outbreak of significant fighting between Israel and Iran.",

      "The strikes \u2014 which the Israel Defense Forces said included dropping \"over 330 different munitions\" on more than 100 targets in Iran \u2014 prompted Iran to launch about 100 missiles at Israel in a retaliatory attack later Friday. The IDF said its Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the missiles, and U.S. officials confirmed that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin claimed intelligence showed \"the Iranian regime has made significant progress in achieving nuclear capability and its ability to act against us,\" calling it an emerging and existential threat to Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not involved in Israel's airstrikes on Iran.",
      "The attacks came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.",
      "The IAEA is the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog. It said in a confidential report last month that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.",
      "President Trump on Friday urged Iran to \"make a deal, before there is nothing left\" and to agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy, was set to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in the Gulf state of Oman on Sunday.",

      "Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 135 miles southeast of Tehran, is the country's main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran's Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz's southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "In\u00a0testimony Friday before the U.N.\u00a0about Israel's strikes, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Iran confirmed that its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant had been attacked. He said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% had \"been destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged. He said Iranian authorities also reported attacks on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and Esfahan site.",
      "Fordo enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 60 miles southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn't as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries,\u00a0Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Bushehr nuclear power plant",
      "Iran's only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr\u00a0on the Persian Gulf, some 465 miles south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.",
      "Arak heavy water reactor",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor\u00a0is 155 miles southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "The U.S. withdrew from the international nuclear agreement known as the JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in 2018, and Iran partially withdrew in 2019.",
      "Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center",
      "The facility in Isfahan, some 215 miles southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country's atomic program.",
      "Tehran Research Reactor",
      "The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country's atomic program. The U.S. actually provided Iran the reactor in 1967 as part of America's \"Atoms for Peace\" program during the Cold War.

    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults, with about one in three Americans between 65 and 74 affected, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",
      "While some of this loss is due to the hair cells in the inner ears breaking down with age and not picking up vibrations as well, per WebMD, there are some risk factors that can be controlled with behavior modifications.",

      "COMMON AGING SYMPTOM COULD WORSEN LONELINESS IN SENIORS",
      "Below are some practical tips you can start implementing today.",
      "1. \u00a0Limit exposure to loud noises",
      "Whether it's a crowded concert, heavy traffic or the constant hum of power tools, repeated exposure to high noise levels is known to cause permanent damage to the delicate structures in the inner ear.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to these loud environments, the NIH states.",
      "Making small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise. (iStock)",
      "Even small adjustments, such as lowering the volume on your headphones or taking quiet breaks during a noisy event, can make a big difference over time.",
      "2. Shield your ears in noisy environments",
      "Damage to the inner ear can happen long before it shows up on a hearing test, according to the NIH, which means prevention is key.",
      "When loud situations are unavoidable, and you expect to be exposed for more than a few minutes, experts recommend wearing ear protection, such as foam earplugs or noise-canceling earmuffs.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to loud environments.",

      "5. Be aware of age-related ear conditions",
      "Although hearing loss is common with age, it\u2019s not the only auditory issue.",
      "According to the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), conditions like tinnitus, which often peaks between ages 60 and 69, can also develop. Tinnitus causes persistent sounds such as ringing, hissing, buzzing or whooshing in the ears.",

      "The bill represented the first chance for the GOP to make good on proposed cuts from DOGE. From a constitutional standpoint, DOGE can only recommend cuts. Congress has authority over spending.

      "Earlier in the day on Thursday, it was unclear whether congressional Republicans had the votes to approve the spending cancellation package. It\u2019s known as a \"rescissions\" bill because it \"rescinds\" money already approved by Congress. But the stakes for this bill were hard to understate for the GOP.

These are things that we had to go fight and get restored.\"",
      "But there were huddles on the floor during the vote itself. Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., chatted with Johnson and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn. A few moments later, LaLota and Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who was a no, switched their ballots to yes.",

      "Bacon had spoken glowingly in recent days about his relationship with public broadcasters in Nebraska. He also had reservations about cutting PEPFAR, the global AIDS mitigation effort. But now Bacon didn\u2019t fry his party.",
      "\"I was assured that PBS would receive funding in this year\u2019s budget. And I discussed PEPFAR with the speaker,\" said the Nebraska Republican.",

      "Failing to pass this teardrop of spending reductions amid a deep federal sea would have been catastrophic for the GOP. Again, especially because of all the braggadocio about cutting spending. Now Republicans can focus on bigger and more controversial spending cut requests from the Trump administration.",
      "But few reporters cared much about what Johnson had to say at that moment because of the immediate mania involving Padilla. The Capitol descended into chaos. The outcome of the critical vote was relegated to a footnote on a wild news day. By nightfall, no one was talking about the rescissions package at all. Let alone Padilla.",
      "Despite the staggering news traffic, the vote notched yet another narrow victory for Johnson and House Republicans. Like it or not, Johnson has piloted the fractious House Republican Conference to a series of slim victories on tough bills all year long.",
      "In February, the House narrowly approved its initial framework for the Big, Beautiful Bill. The outline was essential to help ease eventual passage in the Senate. At one point, it looked like Republicans lacked the votes. In fact, House leaders began sending Members home for the night. Then, they suddenly reversed themselves. Johnson and the GOP eked out a 217-215 victory, approving the framework and sending it to the Senate.",
      "Switch one vote, and the gig was up. The House and Senate would not be on the same page with a budget framework for the touchstone of President Trump\u2019s agenda. That would neutralize the entire exercise.",
      "A few weeks later, the House approved an interim spending bill to avoid a government shutdown, 217-213. Again a narrow vote. Only Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., voted nay. Flip two votes and the tally is 215-215. Again, a tie vote kills the bill.",

      "The Senate okayed one framework for the Big, Beautiful Bill in February. Another one in the spring. But the House and Senate still weren\u2019t on the same page. In mid-April, the House and Senate finally aligned. The House adopted the Senate\u2019s final blueprint for the Big, Beautiful Bill, 216-214. Massie and Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., voted nay. Again, change one vote and it\u2019s a tie. Defeat would have stalled the process for the Big, Beautiful Bill.",
      "Finally, Johnson and the GOP scored perhaps their biggest win of the year in mid-May. The House voted 215-214 with one member voting \"present\" to pass the initial version of the Big, Beautiful Bill and send it to the Senate. Rep. Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., had problems with the bill. But missed the vote because he fell asleep as the House debated the measure in the middle of the night. House Freedom Caucus Chairman and Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., also had reservations. But he cast the \"present\" vote. Either of these members could have tanked the legislation had they voted nay.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was the master at lugging challenging votes across the finish line by a vote or two. She\u2019s the reason Obamacare passed.

      "Facebook scam warning: How Pamela almost fell for a tech support hoax",
      "\"I was working on my Facebook and it suddenly had a screen flash and voice that said the computer was locked and I needed to call a number to report the breach. I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",

      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Back up your important data regularly",
      "Ransomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly\u00a0back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.",
      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts.

Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names.

      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.

Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data.

      "The technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline.",
      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",
      "Physicist Klaus Lackner, at left, and Eric Dahlgren, co-founder and CEO of Aircela, at right\u00a0\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

      "Aircela has secured funding from notable investors, including Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple Labs' Jeff Ubben, a board member at ExxonMobil; and Maersk Growth, the venture capital arm of A.P. Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

      "Aircela's gasoline-from-air machine shows that sometimes the best solutions are the ones that fit right into our daily routines. Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.",

If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process.

With 23 degrees of freedom and powerful knee joints, these robots can throw hooks and side kicks and recover quickly after a fall. They may look a bit clunky in action, but their movements are surprisingly fluid and engaging.",
      "The G1 is designed with accessibility in mind. It's more affordable than Unitree's flagship H1 model, which stands nearly 6 feet tall and costs upwards of $90,000. The G1 can be folded up and carried by one person, and it can reach speeds of about 4.5 miles per hour. Its impressive moves, such as kip-ups and side flips, are made possible by the LAFAN1 motion capture dataset, which translates human movements into robotic actions.",

      "1. Don\u2019t overshare: Even with AI tools like ChatGPT",
      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST 1 CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Tip: Treat all online forms of AI interaction like public forums. Keep your examples generic and use caution with anything that could identify you.",

      "CLEAN UP YOUR PHONE: SPEED, STORAGE AND PRIVACY BOOST IN MINUTES",
      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

Use Facebook's\u00a0Privacy Checkup tool to review and adjust crucial settings, including post visibility, app permissions, search visibility and friend-request settings.

      "The FBI is warning that more than a million smart TVs, streaming boxes, projectors and tablets have been infected by a massive malware operation called BadBox 2.0. The malware turns home electronics into participants in a global network of cybercrime, often before the user even powers them on.",
      "In a statement, the FBI says BadBox 2.0 is commonly found on cheap Android-based devices manufactured in mainland China. These include uncertified tablets, connected TV boxes and other Internet of Things hardware. Many of the infected devices ship with the malware preinstalled. Others are compromised during setup, often through malicious firmware updates or sideloaded apps from unofficial marketplaces.",
      "FBI WARNS OF HACKERS EXPLOITING OUTDATED ROUTERS. CHECK YOURS NOW",
      "Once infected, the devices connect to a command and control server, allowing hackers to reroute malicious traffic through home networks, load fraudulent ads in the background and carry out credential-stuffing attacks without the user knowing. Essentially, your smart TV could be quietly helping someone break into other people\u2019s accounts.",
      "The botnet is primarily used to turn infected devices into residential proxy nodes, providing hackers with anonymous access to real home IP addresses. That means your TV or projector might unknowingly be helping cybercriminals bypass security systems, commit ad fraud or brute-force online accounts while hiding behind your internet connection.",

      "BadBox first appeared in 2023 on generic TV boxes, such as the T95. The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",
      "By March 2025, BadBox had evolved into BadBox 2.0, with more than 1 million active infections detected by HUMAN\u2019s Satori Threat Intelligence team. The majority of devices are uncertified Android Open Source Project builds.\u00a0These are not official Android TV OS products and are not protected by Google Play Protect.",
      "Researchers say the malware has been spotted in 222 countries. A significant number of infections are concentrated in Brazil, followed by the United States, Mexico and Argentina.",
      "The FBI, working with Google, Trend Micro, HUMAN and the Shadowserver Foundation, recently disrupted communications between more than 500,000 infected devices and their control servers. However, the botnet continues to grow as more compromised products reach consumers and remain unnoticed.",
      "Symptoms of infection include strange app marketplaces, disabled Play Protect settings or devices advertised as being unlocked or capable of free streaming. Many of these products come from unknown brands and are sold through unofficial sellers. If you have recently purchased a budget Android TV box or projector, especially one that is not certified by Google, you may want to take a closer look.",

      "If you're wondering whether your smart TV, streaming box, projector or tablet could be part of the BadBox 2.0 botnet, here are some warning signs and checks you can do.",
      "1. You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",
      "Device model: TV98, X96Q_Max_P, Q96L2, X96Q2, X96mini, S168, ums512_1h10_Natv, X96_S400, X96mini_RP, TX3mini, HY-001, MX10PRO, X96mini_Plus1, LongTV_GN7501E, Xtv77, NETBOX_B68, X96Q_PR01, AV-M9, ADT-3, OCBN, X96MATE_PLUS, KM1, X96Q_PRO, Projector_T6P, X96QPRO-TM, sp7731e_1h10_native, M8SPROW, TV008, X96Mini_5G, Q96MAX, Orbsmart_TR43, Z6, TVBOX, Smart, KM9PRO, A15, Transpeed, KM7, iSinbox, I96, SMART_TV, Fujicom-SmartTV, MXQ9PRO, MBOX, X96Q, isinbox, Mbox, R11, GameBox, KM6, X96Max_Plus2, TV007, Q9 Stick, SP7731E, H6, X88, X98K, TXCZ",
      "2. Your device is not Google-certified:\u00a0If your Android device doesn't support\u00a0Google Play Protect or doesn't show the\u00a0Play Protect certification in the Play Store settings, it's likely running on an uncertified version of Android. That's a major red flag. To check:",
      "Open the\u00a0Google Play Store.Tap your profile icon >\u00a0Settings >\u00a0About.Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",
      "Open the\u00a0Google Play Store.",

      "Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",
      "3. Suspicious behavior or strange apps:\u00a0Look for unfamiliar apps you didn't install, apps labeled with foreign characters or alternative app stores on your device. BadBox-infected devices often come with shady apps preloaded.",
      "4. Google Play Protect is disabled:\u00a0If Play Protect has been turned off without your knowledge or is missing altogether, your device may be vulnerable to compromise.",
      "5. Your home internet is acting strange:\u00a0If your network is unusually slow or your router shows unknown devices connected, one of your smart devices may be hijacked and rerouting traffic as part of a residential proxy network.",
      "6. The device came with outdated or unofficial firmware:\u00a0If your device doesn't receive software updates or has a strange update process, that's another potential sign it's not legit or may be compromised.",

A trusted antivirus app can help detect hidden threats, block malicious traffic and warn you about suspicious behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "As BadBox 2.0 continues to evolve, protecting your entire home network, not just individual devices, has become essential to staying one step ahead of cybercriminals.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It's alarming how something as simple as a budget streaming box or projector could be quietly working for cybercriminals. As smart devices become part of almost everything we do, being a careful and informed consumer matters more than ever. Small steps like buying from trusted brands and avoiding unofficial downloads can make a big difference in keeping your home and personal data safe.",

A password manager can securely store and generate complex passwords. It will help you create unique and difficult-to-crack passwords that a hacker could never guess. Second, it also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and fills passwords in for you when you're logging into an account, so that you never have to remember them yourself.\u00a0The fewer passwords you remember, the less likely you are to reuse them for your accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "One of the most noticeable changes this year is Apple\u2019s decision to unify the naming across all its platforms. Instead of traditional version numbers, Apple is now using the year after release as the version name. So the new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.

Users can access ChatGPT within apps like Mail and Notes to generate summaries, compose replies or brainstorm content ideas on demand.",
      "This partnership marks the first time OpenAI's GPT-4o has been embedded into the Apple ecosystem for fallback AI tasks.

Apple originally pitched the new Siri as the next big step for the company, with personalized capabilities based on your relationships, conversations, routines and more.

      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",

It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "How to tell if your iPad has been hacked",
      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",
      "An Apple iPad (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",
      "HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD",
      "One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn\u2019t make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.",
      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered. Another clue is seeing unfamiliar charges or App Store purchases on your Apple ID bill, since unauthorized purchases or subscriptions often mean that someone has compromised your account and is using it maliciously.",

      "Top tips to protect your iPad from hackers and malware",
      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

In each of these cases, we are carefully following the evidence to seek the strongest sentences permissible by law against these domestic terrorists, and nothing is off the table.\"",
      "Pack added that prosecutors would \"typically use existing laws to file charges such as arson, assault on federal officers, destruction of property, or conspiracy.\"",
      "\"Importantly, peaceful protesters who exercise their First Amendment rights without violence are not subject to terrorism investigations or charges. The term is only applied when criminal acts cross the line into ideologically driven violence,\" Pack said.",
      "Pack said while there is no \"specific crime called domestic terrorism\" in U.S. law, the government still uses that term to describe certain dangerous acts.",

      "\"Federal agencies like the FBI and Department of Homeland Security consider anarchist violent extremists part of the domestic terrorism threat landscape, especially when violence is organized, politically motivated, and targets law enforcement or government institutions,\" Pack said.",
      "\"The anarchists plan before they even show up. They use encrypted messaging apps like Signal and Telegram to coordinate everything: where to meet, who brings what. They discuss how to blend in, where to watch police, and how to respond when law enforcement pushes back,\" Pack continued.",

They use distractions and speed, forcing police to react, then record that reaction. Their goal is to provoke.

      "New accusations against the three brothers accused of orchestrating a decade-long scheme to sex traffic women were revealed this week as authorities look to further cement their case against the high-profile defendants.",
      "Real estate moguls Tal Alexander and Oren Alexander, along with their brother, Alon, are facing charges of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, inducement to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity and three counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, according to a federal superseding indictment.",
      "Tal Alexander faces additional sex trafficking and inducement counts, with Alon and Oren Alexander facing an additional charge of aggravated sex abuse, according to court documents. The charges stem from allegations from at least six new victims \u2013 including one minor.",

      "The brothers pleaded not guilty to all counts, bringing the total to 10 charges against them.",
      "\"The federal charges in the indictment against Alon, Oren, and Tal Alexander are serious because they involve sex trafficking and aggravated sexual abuse,\" Kelly Hyman, a trial attorney and host of the true-crime podcast \"Unresolved: The Diddy Cases,\" told Fox News Digital. \"Since the charges are brought at the federal level, there can be more severe penalties compared to state level crimes.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors allege the three men lured dozens of victims to be sexually assaulted by promising luxury travel and other expensive accommodations, conspiring for more than a decade and leveraging their real estate industry status to attract women from 2009 to 2021. The brothers allegedly would organize elaborate vacations for their victims, subsequently assaulting the women while traveling.",

      "\"In sex trafficking cases, deception, drugs, and false pretenses, like promises of luxury travel, could be considered important facts if it goes to the force, fraud or coercion of the sex trafficking,\" Hyman said. \"And thus could have legal weight to prove a case as the prosecution has the burden to prove the charges against a defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. It is ultimately up to the jury as they are the trier of facts, and the jury will decide what weight to give these facts based on the evidence presented.\"",
      "According to the indictment, the brothers would incapacitate the women before they were sexually assaulted and raped \u2013 sometimes alongside multiple men \u2013 with some of the attacks happening within hours of meeting the victims.",
      "\"Often, the Alexander brothers drugged their victims before assaulting them, preventing them from fighting back or escaping,\" the indictment reads.",

      "Prosecutors allege that immediately following the attacks, the brothers would \"sometimes [offer] the victims material items, including travel, concert tickets, and other luxury experiences.\"",
      "\"When prosecuting a sex trafficking case in federal court, prosecutors must demonstrate that \u2018force, threats of force, fraud or coercion\u2019 were used to compel the victim to engage in a sex act,\" Hyman told Fox News Digital. \"However, if the victim is a minor, this specific proof is not required. The prosecution must still prove a defendant knowingly recruited the minor for a commercial sex act, but not particularly through force, fraud or coercion.\"",

      "\"We hold strongly to that stand. President Trump won because of the Evangelical vote.

For evangelical Christians, he said, support for Israel is rooted in religious conviction rather than political ideology. They view appeasement of Iran or engagement with terrorists not just as flawed policy, but as morally wrong and fundamentally evil.",

These include the terror incident in Boulder,\u00a0Colorado, where an illegal Egyptian immigrant injured 15 people with Molotov cocktails during a march supporting hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, as well as the fatal shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., which claimed the lives of two staff members from the Israeli Embassy.",
      "\"We expect Congress to take up meaningful legislation aimed at combating the scourge of violent antisemitism raging across the country,\" Hagee said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of foreign policy and security experts have compiled a report looking at a solution for a \"day after\" plan in Gaza, and believe private security contractors, which have heavy experience in the Mideast could be a solution to replace Hamas.",
      "The question of a \"day after\" plan in the Gaza Strip has plagued negotiations between Israel, the U.S., Arab nations and Hamas for months and has ultimately led to the terrorist network\u2019s refusal to release the 55 hostages still held there.",
      "However, foreign policy leaders and security experts based in Washington may have the key that could provide a solution to help rebuild the war-torn Gaza Strip where others cannot: private security contractors (PSC).",
      "PSCs, which have heavy experience in the Middle East and decades of lessons learned to draw from, could be used as non-state actors to provide stability and a path forward for the Palestinians, but they would have to start with humanitarian aid, John Hannah, former national security advisor to Dick Cheney and current Randi & Charles Wax senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told Fox News Digital.",
      "Palestinians continue their daily lives under harsh conditions amid the rubble of destroyed buildings in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza following the enforcement of a ceasefire agreement on Feb. 10, 2025. (Mahmoud ssa/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "ISRAEL OBJECTS TO FOREIGN NATIONS SANCTIONING ITS OFFICIALS",
      "In a plan hatched out following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the subsequent outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip, a group of eight members with JINSA and the Vandenberg Coalition comprised a report that detailed how the handling of humanitarian aid could completely change security in the region.",
      "The plan, in part, initially looked similar to the mechanism known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by the U.S. and Israel, and which launched last month to distribute aid to Palestinians.",
      "However, the plan comprised by Hannah and the team took it a step further and argued that these aid actors should also be involved in rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"We thought humanitarian issues was the best way [forward],\" Hannah said.\u00a0\"It was the common denominator that would allow all of the major stakeholders that want to get to a better \u2018day after\u2019 \u2013 Israel, the United States, the key pragmatic Arab states \u2013 they all could agree that we can't agree on a political vision for Palestine 10 years from now, and the issue of a Palestinian state, but we can all agree on this apple pie and motherhood issue that we don't want to see starving, suffering Palestinians.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge in a show of strength, escorting Red Cross vehicles carrying three Israeli hostages to be released as part of the ceasefire deal. (TPS-IL)",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had already detailed the need to eliminate Hamas following the deadliest-ever attack on Israel, but the group of eight experts also identified that aid, long used by Hamas to maintain power by using it to incentivize support and recruitment, and to punish opposition, needed to be the key to cementing actual change.",
      "\"We needed a solution on humanitarian aid,\" Hannah said. \"And when we looked around the world, who could do this, take over the humanitarian aid? We were left with one option.\"",

Israel lacks legitimacy with the Palestinian population, and frankly, it had its hands full doing the military job of defeating Hamas,\" he added. \u00a0\"American forces weren't going to do it. We didn't think Arab forces would step up and do this. And the U.N. system as it existed under UNRWA was illegitimate in the eyes of Israel.\"",
      "The group not only briefed the Biden and Netanyahu administrations on the proposal, but held numerous discussions with Israeli officials in 2024 on how such a plan could work.",
      "Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero \u2013 who served as deputy chief of staff, Strategic Operations for Multinational Forces-Iraq for 2007-2008 and who was tasked by Gen. David Petraeus to create a system of accountability over PSCs in Iraq following the Blackwater incident in September 2007 known as the Nisour Square massacre \u2013 also briefed Israeli officials on how a PSC mechanism could work in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Progress on the proposal appeared to stall by summer last year as then-President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were at increasing loggerheads over humanitarian concerns and mounting civilian Palestinian death tolls.",
      "However, Hannah questioned whether the seed had been planted with Israel by the time the Trump administration re-entered office, enabling the GHF to come in and start distributing aid.",
      "The GHF, though it has distributed over 16 million meals since it began operations in late May, saw a chaotic start with starving Palestinians rushing certain sites and reports of violence unfolding.",

      "Though the reports of the level of chaos have reportedly been exaggerated by Hamas \u2013 which ultimately would benefit from the GHF\u2019s failure as experts have explained \u2013 the group initially drew some criticism over transparency concerns, though the group has been looking to remedy this with regal updates.",
      "The group, which saw its third leadership in as many weeks earlier this month, told Fox News Digital that despite some frustration among world leaders and aid groups, its goal is to work with major organizations like the United Nations and others to better distribute aid across Gaza where those programs are still flagging.",

      "However, she has also refused to confirm whether any U.S. officials are working for the program.",
      "PSCs have a storied history in the Middle East, and not only the U.S. war on terror. They have been used by nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which could lend them a level of acceptance that would not be attainable by another force.",
      "The proposal issued by Hannah and his colleagues took the use of PSCs one step beyond humanitarian aid and argued they could make a positive impact in the actual reconstruction of the Gaza Strip \u2013 an idea that was also presented to the Trump administration this year.",
      "Displaced Palestinians wait to receive a free meal from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025. (Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's not at all foreign to these Arab parties that you might employ PSCs for certain critical missions,\" Hannah said. \"Our idea was, let's scale it up. Let's unify the effort. Let's have America and the Arabs lead it.",
      "\"The Arabs would put in most of the humanitarian aid workers, a lot of the financing, and then they would hire some of these international PSCs with a lot of experience to come in and protect those operations,\" he explained. \"You'd have the Arabs engaged, which we thought was absolutely critical.\"",
      "The plan also included bringing in other international aid organizations that would work with these PSCs to expand developments like housing projects, community development and infrastructure repair to restore electricity and water.",
      "\"And eventually, hopefully, begin to identify new leadership, local leadership in Gaza, who would be prepared to cooperate with the operations of this nonprofit entity,\" Hannah said. \"Local Gazans of goodwill, who wanted to be rid of Hamas, who this entity could provide some support to, some protection to so they can, could begin rebuilding Gaza civil administration.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",

      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

      "In the poll, 81% of U.S. adults say that if a federal court rules that an administration action is illegal, then the administration has to follow its ruling, while 19% say the administration can ignore the ruling and continue its action.",
      "But among people who consider themselves supporters of the MAGA movement, there's a sharper divide. According to the poll, supporters of President Donald Trump are split, 50%-50%, over whether he should comply with federal court orders.",
      "Democrats are almost unanimous on the issue, with 96% saying the administration has to follow court orders. Among independents, 87% say the administration must obey court orders, while 13% say Trump can ignore them.",
      "The issue of whether the White House can ignore rulings from federal courts has come to the fore as the administration carries out executive actions, including its deportation program, at rapid speed.",

Several federal judges, meanwhile, have considered whether to hold executive branch officials in contempt for what one called \"willful disregard\" of judicial orders.",
      "The issue has also arisen in the high-profile case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He was deported to an El Salvadoran prison in what the government initially called an \"administrative error.\" The case rose to the Supreme Court, which ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" his return.

Rather, the current case focuses on the power of judges to block presidential policies through nationwide injunctions.",
      "If the court rules in Trump\u2019s favor, district judges would be limited from using nationwide injunctions to temporarily block an administration policy. There have been at least 39 such rulings during Trump\u2019s second term.",

      "Across Hollywood, talking about it publicly can sometimes be taboo. Using it without disclosing that you did could make you the center of controversy. And protesting its use has been the norm.",
      "But even amid widespread vocal pushback against generative artificial intelligence, industry leaders say its use in film and TV is slowly becoming mainstream. More filmmakers are using evolving AI tools, and studios are partnering with AI companies to explore how they can use the technology in content creation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s being used by everybody that doesn\u2019t talk about the fact that they\u2019re using it,\u201d Michael Burns, vice chairman of Lionsgate, said during a panel at the third annual Runway AI Film Festival in Los Angeles last week.",
      "Lionsgate, which is behind hits like the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d and \u201cHunger Games\u201d franchises, signed a deal with Runway last fall allowing its video generation model to train on the studio\u2019s movies and TV shows. Burns joked that AI tools are like the Ozempic of the film industry, referring to the popularity of the semaglutide-based weight loss drug.",
      "Burns was among hundreds \u2014 including a mix of creatives and execs \u2014 who attended the AI video company\u2019s showcase of user-submitted short films made with generative tools. The festival, which was also held in New York City this month, ballooned from 300 film submissions in its first year to 6,000 submissions this year, its organizers said.",
      "While using AI in film isn\u2019t completely new, the technology has continued to stoke concerns among creatives. AI was a sticking point during the 2023 writers and actors strikes against studios, with creatives seeking assurances that their work wouldn\u2019t be replaced by the technology.",
      "Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela, however, is optimistic about AI\u2019s impact on the labor force, telling reporters before the Los Angeles festival that history has \u201cproven once and again\u201d that industries can adapt to new technologies.",
      "AI-generated video-making has taken off even as it remains controversial. The technology has given rise to music videos to brand advertisements to nonconsensual deepfakes. Though AI videos have frequently been marked by telltale distortions, such as extra fingers or nonsensical physics, Google\u2019s latest video generation model, Veo 3, shocked the internet last month with how seemingly flawless its outputs were.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be new industries\u201d as a result of AI, Valenzuela said. \u201cJust the hard thing is it\u2019s really hard to understand these industries when they\u2019re new; we have never experienced them.\u201d",
      "The company has increased its presence in Hollywood in the past few years.",
      "Burns said the partnership between Lionsgate and Runway is an attempt to create higher-quality content for lower prices.",
      "\u201cEven a year or two years ago, there was no chance that the output was going to be able to be projected on the big screen without you seeing gaps or somebody with three arms or a dragon that didn\u2019t look like a dragon,\u201d Burns added. \u201cAnd now, today, it\u2019s a completely different place.\u201d",
      "Runway also recently reached a deal with AMC Networks, giving it access to Runway\u2019s AI tools for use in marketing materials and TV development processes, such as pre-visualization or special effects ideation.",
      "All 10 of the films shown at the festival included generative video, but not all were made entirely with AI. The shorts, which were created in a variety of animated and photorealistic styles, appeared to lean into the more absurdist themes made possible by generative tools.",
      "One followed the perspective of a chicken on its way to prison. Another offered life lessons through a small insect\u2019s journey. And another painted a scene of human souls desperate to reclaim their bodies after Earth\u2019s collapse.",
      "Other AI companies have also upped their visibility in the industry in recent years.",
      "OpenAI, which is behind ChatGPT, held its own AI film screenings this year in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo to tout its popular text-to-video model Sora. The tool, launched in early 2024, stirred both buzz and panic when the company first teased its hyperrealistic generation capabilities.",
      "Last year, the Tribeca Film Festival partnered with Runway and OpenAI to highlight more short films that leveraged AI.",
      "Even some film schools appear to be hopping on the AI bandwagon. Elizabeth Daley, dean of the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, said AI is being embedded in various courses, including one focused on AI creativity. She said the school encourages students to explore AI as long as it doesn\u2019t become \u201can excuse not to work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to stay in that conversation. We need to stay in the struggle to make sure that the tools that are developed are actually the tools that writers, directors, producers, cinematographers, animators need to do their work,\u201d Daley said at a panel at the Runway film festival. \u201cAnd those will create other jobs. No doubt.\u201d"

      "On Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, with 51,548 fans on their feet and television cameras trained on the field, Vanessa Hern\u00e1ndez stood behind home plate and sang the national anthem, which is traditionally sung before every sporting event in the United States.",
      "Only this time, it was different.",
      "Known to fans by the stage name, Nezza, the Dominican American singer took the mic at Dodger Stadium and performed \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d the official Spanish-language version of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d \u2014 apparently against the wishes of the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Wearing a shirt adorned with the flag of her family\u2019s homeland, Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s voice quivered with emotion as she reached the final line, her eyes welling with tears. But her defiance was clear.",

      "\u201cMy parents are immigrants,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been citizens my whole life at this point, but I just can\u2019t imagine them being ripped away from me. Not now. Not when I was a kid. Never.\u201d",
      "Nezza's Spanish-language rendition took place after a wave of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids have been impacting Latino communities in Los Angeles, leading to protests and more outcry after President Donald Trump sent National Guard troops and Marines in the city. One of the state's U.S. senators, Democrat Alex Padilla, was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a news conference after confronting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with a question about the recent actions in Los Angeles.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has pleaded for federal forces to back down. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called the raids \u201ca humanitarian disaster.\u201d",
      "During Saturday's game, when Nezza turned the anthem into an act of protest, many of the fans in attendance didn\u2019t know what to think. Some clapped and cheered, others stood with their mouths agape. Others turned to social media to let the world know what was happening, and Nezza\u2019s decision was met with mixed reviews.",
      "\u201cThese people are evil,\u201d one user wrote about Nezza\u2019s act of protest.",
      "\u201cThey should\u2019ve cut off her mic and apologized to their audience. This kind of inaction, might push away a lot of Dodger fans,\u201d wrote another.",
      "\u201cHas her legal status been checked? DEPORT HER!,\u201d someone else wrote.",
      "But the reviews weren\u2019t all negative. Many people applauded Nezza\u2019s courage and bravery.",
      "\u201cHer courage is palpable. So proud of her,\u201d one user wrote on X.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m obsessed with her! That was beautiful,\u201d another wrote.",
      "\u201cAwesome,\u201d said a user, summarizing the performance in one word.",
      "While Nezza was stirring up controversy with her rendition of the anthem, Shohei Ohtani was turning baseballs into souvenirs: The reigning National League MVP hammered two home runs \u2014 his 21st and 22nd of the season \u2014 leading the Dodgers to an 11-5 rout of the archrival San Francisco Giants. The win catapulted Los Angeles into sole possession of first place in the NL West.",
      "But for many people there, it was Nezza\u2019s voice, not Ohtani\u2019s bat, that stole the night.",
      "Following Nezza's Spanish-language rendition, the Dodgers didn\u2019t issue a statement, and they had made no previous comments about the immigration raids and protests taking place in the city.",
      "Though the Dodgers haven\u2019t banned Nezza \u2014 and sources say they don\u2019t plan to \u2014 she joked online, \u201cSafe to say I\u2019m never allowed in that stadium ever again.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement crackdown has heightened concerns of foreign-born residents, especially undocumented immigrants and their families, about how they should prepare for worst-case scenarios of being detained or deported.",
      "Planning ahead for such emergency scenarios must include a strategy for who will handle their finances and how, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen people are detained or deported without having legally designated somebody to manage their assets, they might lose access to their accounts or their property,\u201d said Sarah Pacilio, a director at the Appleseed Network, a nonprofit network of justice centers in the U.S. and Mexico.",
      "Managing financial matters from abroad can be challenging due to limited access to bank accounts or service providers, she said.",
      "Make a plan for a worst-case scenario",
      "Having a plan is crucial. The Appleseed Network has published a detailed \u201cDeportation Preparation Manual for Immigrant Families,\u201d which is available for free on its website. There are also financial planners who offer their services for free to families in need, through groups including the Financial Planning Association and the Foundation for Financial Planning.",
      "\u201cRight now, there\u2019s a lot of fear, there\u2019s a lot of trauma,\u201d said certified financial planner Louis Barajas, CEO of International Private Wealth Advisors.",
      "\u201cI want to give people information so they can at least take some power back,\u201d said Barajas, whose firm is based in Orange County, California, and who does pro bono work with Santa Ana\u2019s predominantly Latino community.",
      "To protect assets \u2014 including homes, bank accounts and retirement savings \u2014 financial and legal experts recommend taking these key steps:",
      "Collect and secure key documents",
      "Collect and make copies of important documents, including birth certificates, immigration paperwork, other forms of identification and work permits.",
      "Make a list of bank and credit card accounts, loans, leases, contracts, property and any assets in your children\u2019s names. Include contact information for the banks, lenders and other companies involved with those accounts.",
      "Store these records and documents in a safe deposit box at a bank or a fireproof, waterproof box or safe. Digitize the documents, too, with password-protected cloud storage or encrypted flash drives.",
      "Taking this step can help ensure you have key details about accounts and assets wherever you are, and that physical documents are in one safe location for a trusted family member to access.",
      "Check access to accounts",
      "Contact your financial service providers to understand your options and rights. Pacilio recommends reaching out to your banks and lenders to determine if you can list a foreign address on your account, add someone to your account or continue using those accounts outside the U.S.",
      "\u201cKnow what those options are in advance so that you can adequately prepare for them, and that helps to avoid surprise in a crisis situation,\u201d she said.",
      "Establish a power of attorney",
      "Have legal documents in place, especially a financial power of attorney, or POA. Designating a POA also creates a back-up plan, Barajas said, so that \u201csomeone they trust can manage their finances if they are out of the country.\u201d",
      "A POA can also give the person you designate the authority to sign checks from your bank account, make decisions about your child\u2019s schooling and health care, or use your money to buy or sell major items such as a car, according to the Appleseed Network.",
      "Protect finances for future generations",
      "Work with a legal expert to draft a pre-need guardianship document. Naming a guardian for your child in a legal document will allow an adult of your choice to step in if you are no longer able to care for the child, say, if you are deported and your child remains in the U.S., said Barajas, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council.",
      "Consider buying a term life insurance policy, which can provide benefits to your loved ones if you die. Already have one? Carefully review your beneficiaries.",
      "Create an estate plan. Consider setting up a trust to transfer assets such as real estate, non-retirement savings and life insurance proceeds, Barajas said.",
      "\u201cA lot of single mothers who have been deported do have insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they\u2019re they\u2019re single mothers, they have named their minor children as beneficiaries on their life insurance policies \u2014 and that\u2019s a major mistake.\u201d",
      "Insurers won\u2019t give proceeds directly to minors, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019d like them to get an estate plan done so they can name a trust as a beneficiary,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if something were to happen to them, someone can manage that money for their children.\u201d",

      "Combs' lawyers had made a last-ditch appeal Sunday to keep Juror No. 6, a 41-year-old Black man, on the 12-person panel. The defense team filed a 14-page letter arguing there wasn't a valid basis to toss him, and that doing so would be discriminatory.",

      "\"We believe that motive is supported not only by [the U.S. government's] remarkable decision to use 7 of its 9 peremptory strikes on Black jurors but also by the history of the investigation and prosecution, which has been characterized by extreme government overreach from the beginning,\" the defense wrote.",

In addition to Catholic entities, Lutheran, Episcopalian and Baptist groups are also among the challengers.",

      "Trump Mobile, as the service will be known, will soon be available for what Donald Trump Jr. described as \"real Americans\" seeking \"true value from their mobile carriers.\" The president\u2019s eldest son, who serves as executive vice president of the Trump Organization, made the remarks at a press event in New York City on Monday morning.",
      "According to the TrumpMobile.com website, the plan starts at $47.45 a month, reference to the elder Trump having served as the 45th and 47th president.",
      "By comparison, Boost Mobile and Verizon\u2019s Visible offer similar unlimited service for $25 per month. T-Mobile and Spectrum offer unlimited plans for $30.",
      "The organization is also rolling out a $499 gold-colored phone, dubbed the T1, later this year.",
      "The announcement represents another example of the unprecedented line-blurring the president has undertaken by running businesses as he also runs the country.",
      "Late Friday, the president filed financial disclosure forms for 2024 showing hundreds of Trump-branded business ventures still in operation \u2014 while the Trump Organization, the main corporate entity run by the president's family, had earned more than $57 million from sales of digital tokens launched by its World Liberty Financial cryptocurrency platform.",
      "Trump has taken a much more aggressive move to wield the executive office, especially through his tariffs strategy, to threaten businesses whose policies he does not approve of \u2014 and reward those he favors.",
      "The launch of a wireless phone is a particularly striking case, since it comes as the president seeks to bring more production of electronics, including smartphones, to the U.S. Trump has explicitly threatened Apple for not making its iPhones stateside.",
      "The White House referred a request for comment to the Trump Organization. It did not respond to a followup query asking whether the president planned to use his own branded wireless service or the T1 phone.",
      "Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump Mobile users would be able to receive telemedicine on their phone, roadside assistance and unlimited texting to at least 100 countries.",
      "The service and phone are not actually made by the Trump Organization. The company is licensing the president's name to a wireless service that is supported by the three major U.S. phone carriers. In a separate appearance with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo's \"Mornings with Maria\" show Monday, Eric Trump, the president's second-eldest son and another Trump Organization vice president, said the phones would also be made in the U.S. but did not state the manufacturer. He also said the service's call center would be based in St. Louis.",
      "Representatives for the three major U.S. phone carriers did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The announcement appears to echo one made earlier this month by the trio of actor-hosts of the popular \"SmartLess\" podcast, who said they were launching their own wireless service by purchasing network capacity from T-Mobile.",
      "Another actor, Ryan Reynolds, has invested in Mint Mobile, which also uses T-Mobile's network. Both have been pitched as value services for users who don't have need for unlimited data."

      "As Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, prepare for a lavish, star-studded wedding in Venice, not everyone in the Italian city is happy about the impending nuptials.",
      "\"No space for Bezos,\" a sign read at a protest by residents who say the famed canal city is already overrun by tourists, billionaires or otherwise.",
      "Protesters say their issue is with the happy couple and authorities, like Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro, who said he was \"ashamed\" by the protests.",
      "\"We want to send a very clear message: The ones who should be ashamed are them,\" protester Federica Toninello told Reuters. \"They are the people who have destroyed this city.\"",
      "Venice\u2019s 2-square-mile main island and historic center, home to about 50,000 people, receives about 20 million visitors yearly, mostly day-trippers from cruise ships or other cities. While tourism is central to Venice\u2019s economy and cultural identity, critics say it has displaced residents and damaged historic sites.",
      "Venetians\u2019 wedding wariness comes as demonstrators across southern Europe rallied over the weekend against mass tourism. Residents protested on the Spanish island of Mallorca and in Spanish cities such as Barcelona \u2014 where tourists were spritzed with water guns \u2014 as well as in Venice and Lisbon, the capital of Portugal.",
      "Officials in Venice are aware of the problem, and last year Brugnaro introduced a daily entrance fee of 5 euros ($5.79).",
      "But Brugnaro and others are rolling out the red carpet for Bezos, the world\u2019s fourth-richest person after fellow tech titans Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Brugnaro said that Bezos had \"achieved great things on a global level\" and that the city was \"extremely proud\" to host him.",
      "\"It is an honor that he is coming to Venice,\" he said.",
      "Though details of the Bezos-S\u00e1nchez wedding are top secret, according to Vogue, the guest list could include celebrities such as Eva Longoria, Katy Perry \u2014 S\u00e1nchez\u2019s crewmate on an April spaceflight by Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin \u2014 and at least some of the Kardashians.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, city hall officials said regular taxi and water transports would continue during the wedding festivities, which are reportedly set to begin June 24.",
      "Officials said only about 30 of the 280 water taxis have been reserved, and only three or four hotels will be used for the event.",
      "\"The city is fully accustomed to hosting high-profile events of this nature and scale, including other celebrity weddings, international summits such as the G7 and G20, as well as traditional events like the Festa del Redentore and the Venice Biennale,\" the statement said.",
      "City officials added that \"the celebrations, attended by 250 guests, will blend into the daily rhythm of a city that, with dignity and respect, welcomes thousands of visitors from around the world while safeguarding the quality of life for its residents, workers, and students.\"",
      "\"Protest initiatives are in no way representative of the majority of citizens, who are proud that Venice has been chosen as the wedding location,\" the statement added.",
      "Venice has a long history of hosting major events, including international summits and the 2014 wedding of actor George Clooney and human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin.",
      "\"Once again, Venice proves to be a world stage,\" Brugnaro said."

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Shohei Ohtani is going to be the starting pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night against San Diego, 21 months after the two-way star had elbow surgery.",
      "The Dodgers made the announcement after Sunday night's 5-4 win over San Francisco. Ohtani likely will be used as an opener as the NL West leaders kick off a four-game set against the visiting Padres.",
      "\"Shohei is getting antsy, which is a good thing for us,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said before the team announced Ohtani would get the ball on Monday night.",
      "\"I don't know if it's going to be one or two innings, but my guess is probably an inning to start. But it's a good thing. The live, simulated, or whatever, sort of ran its course. He's ready to make his debut on the mound.\"",
      "Ohtani has not pitched in a game since Aug. 23, 2023, when he got hurt during a start for the Los Angeles Angels against Cincinnati. He had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018, and is recovering from right elbow surgery on Sept. 19, 2023.",
      "In the second season of a $700 million, 10-year contract, he paused his pitching work after a mound session on Feb. 25 to prepare for opening day as a hitter, then started bullpen sessions on March 29 and batting practice on May 25.",
      "Roberts said he is excited to see Ohtani pitch in a big league game again.",
      "\"There's been a lot of anticipation,\" he said. \"I think we've done it the right way as far as our process, communicating with Shohei and feeling good. ... It's good for our team. Our guys are excited about this potential. And obviously, most important, I'm excited for Shohei.\"",
      "A three-time MVP, Ohtani is hitting .297 with an NL-leading 1.035 OPS, 25 homers and 41 RBIs. A batter only last year in his first season with the Dodgers, Ohtani hit .290 with 54 homers, 130 RBIs and 59 stolen bases.",
      "On Sunday, Roberts said rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki appears likely to be sidelined for a lengthy stretch. With Sasaki (right shoulder impingement), Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Tyler Glasnow (right shoulder inflammation) on the injured list, the Dodgers have resorted to bullpen games.",
      "Sasaki has not pitched in a game since May 9 and is not part of the team's long-term pitching plans this season.",
      "\"I think that's what the mindset should be,\" Roberts said before the game. \"Being thrust into this environment certainly was a big undertaking for him, and now you layer in the health part and the fact he's a starting pitcher, knowing what the build-up (required to return) entails \u2026 I think that's the prudent way to go about it.\"",
      "Sasaki, 23, went 1-1 with a 4.72 ERA in eight starts after joining the Dodgers from the Pacific League's Chiba Lotte Marines, averaging less than 4 1/3 innings per start. His walked 22 and struck out 24 in 34 1/3 innings and his fastball averaged 95.7 mph, down 3-4 mph from his average in Japan.",
      "Roberts said Sasaki was pain-free when he resumed throwing in early June, but the pitcher was shut down after feeling discomfort this past week. Sasaki recently received a cortisone injection in the shoulder; Roberts said no further scans are planned.",
      "\"I don't think it's pain,\" Roberts said. \"I don't know if it's discomfort, if it's tightness, if he's just not feeling strong, whatever the adjective you want to use. That's more of a question for Roki, as far as the sensation he's feeling.",
      "\"He's just not feeling like he can ramp it up, and we're not going to push him to do something he doesn't feel good about right now.\""

But in the days prior to the first attack, the president became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted and came to accept that Israel was determined to launch strikes.",

      "\"It\u2019s like all of a sudden there\u2019s nobody but us on the dance floor. And I\u2019m talking to her like we\u2019ve known each other our whole lives. (It was) the kind of safety combined with just the depth of connections. She was very vulnerable. And I was at the time. There was a depth of connection that I do not believe I have ever had,\" he says.",
      "When asked if he had a similar moment with his other wives, Kody Brown says, \"Not that I recall.\"",
      "\"It was more of like a pragmatic thought process,\" he says."

      "From the beginning on \u201cBravo\u2019s Love Hotel,\u201d Shannon Storms Beador had her sights set on one man, but did their love story continue outside of the hotel?",
      "The \u201cReal Housewives of Orange County\u201d star struck up a romance on the show in Los Cabos, Mexico, with Earl Thompson from Lawrenceville, Georgia. She even helped Earl get contact information for his estranged stepson, with assistance from her attorney back home.",
      "Shannon, whose previous marriage to David Beador played out over the years on \u201cRHOC,\u201d says the No. 1 thing that attracted her to Earl was his \u201ckind eyes\u201d and the eye contact he maintained. \u201cHe was engaged in a conversation,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI need to be a priority. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been a priority in any of the relationships that I\u2019ve been in, and so, that\u2019s my hope.\u201d",
      "Earl was previously married twice and lost one of his wives to leukemia, which is one of the first things he told Shannon when they met. While Shannon and Earl had many sweet moments together, they also had their share of disagreements.",
      "Shannon initially got upset when Earl didn\u2019t comfort her on a particularly emotional night for her: the one-year anniversary of her DUI arrest. A few episodes later, Earl was not happy with Shannon for choosing to go out with her \u201cLove Hotel\u201d castmates, Luann de Lesseps, Ashley Darby and Gizelle Bryant, instead of being there for him as he stressed over the path of a hurricane headed toward his Florida and Georgia homes.",
      "\u201cI did have a few hiccups with Earl,\u201d Shannon says, \u201cbut there\u2019s something about him that when we were together and things were good, it was really good.\u201d",
      "Despite her ups and downs with Earl in Mexico, she says she was \u201ceasily sucked back in\u201d after filming for the show ended.",
      "\u201cAfter the show, we did \u2014 we talked every day,\u201d she says. \u201cI went and stayed with him in Georgia. He came out to Orange County, but in the end, it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have very different personalities, in the long run,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd we were in a bubble there, but I wish it would\u2019ve been different. But it is what it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s hard to watch the show right now because I remember that I cared about him, and so it\u2019s hard.\u201d",
      "Shannon says she has no interest in dating at this time because she does not want to get hurt again.",
      "\u201cI know that when I watch a show, and I\u2019m invested in certain people, I want them to stay together,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was important for me to try my hardest to make it work.\u201d",
      "As for what she\u2019s looking for in a partner, Shannon, who also describes herself as \u201ca relationship girl,\u201d says she, most importantly, wants someone with \u201ca kind heart,\u201d adding that looks are \u201cnot that important.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want someone that\u2019s intelligent and that has a sense of humor, because I like to learn from people,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would be OK on my own, but now that I have been, I kind of like it,\u201d Shannon, who says she does not use dating apps, explains. After her marriage ended, she began dating John Janssen in 2019, and the two very publicly broke up in 2022. Janssen has since moved on with \u201cRHOC\u201d alum Alexis Bellino.",
      "\u201cIn my perfect world, I would meet someone who is confident, successful and thinks it\u2019s really cute that I\u2019m on this silly show and doesn\u2019t want to be a part of it. Because that\u2019s a really hard thing when you\u2019ve been doing it for as long as we have, that, you know, does someone want to be famous or not?\u201d Shannon says.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what happened in my last relationship,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe wanted to be, and I didn\u2019t think he did.\u201d"

      "If you stand still too long, people will peg you \u2014 at least according to Bryan Cranston. \u201cI like to keep people guessing,\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "That\u2019s why the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor says he prefers to \u201ckeep moving around\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m playing a lot of dramatic roles recently, I will look for comedic roles and I keep swimming back and forth so that I\u2019m not pegged as any given one person,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s that versatility that\u2019s earned Cranston six Emmy Awards, two Tonys, a best actor Oscar nomination and a host of other accolades. And, at 69, he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.",
      "Cranston currently appears in the latest Wes Anderson film, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d along with starring in \u201cEverything\u2019s Going to Be Great,\u201d a new drama for which Cranston learned how to play the bagpipes. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019ll soon be crossing the Atlantic to perform on London\u2019s famed West End in the Arthur Miller play \u201cAll My Sons,\u201d starting in November.",
      "\u201cI do love it. I have a relationship with this,\u201d explains Cranston. \u201cIt takes a committed relationship, that you\u2019re committing to this as your life, just like you would in your personal life. And if you do so, you have a chance to be successful in your personal life or your business life.\u201d",
      "No stranger to success, Cranston got his start doing bit parts in a variety of TV shows and movies before landing the breakout role of Hal Wilkerson in \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d in 2000. It's a role that earned him a handful of Emmy nominations and made Cranston a household name.",
      "However, it was the brief part he played in a 1998 episode of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d that put Cranston on the radar of one of the show\u2019s writers, Vince Gilligan. Eight years later, when Gilligan went to cast Walter White in his new antihero show, \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he remembered Cranston and rang up the actor\u2019s agent. That decision would forever cement their legacies in television history.",
      "'You\u2019re Only as Good as You Dare to Be Bad'",
      "With a storied career in film, stage and television (both behind and in front of the camera), Cranston says he continues to seek out unique roles and opportunities that speak to him on a personal level.",
      "\u201cMy real life is filled with a variety of different characters. I\u2019m sometimes sincere, sometimes silly, sometimes moody, sometimes romantic ... and so there are different facets of ourselves that you are familiar with in your own life. Sometimes you\u2019re sad, sometimes you\u2019re joyous,\u201d explains Cranston.",
      "\u201cSo, I curate the roles I do. I look for roles that I can be different or something that challenges me that, 'Ooh, that\u2019s really not like me at all,' so I need to dive into that and see what comes of it,\u201d he says.",
      "In fact, it\u2019s his willingness to take risks that\u2019s gotten him this far, and it\u2019s based on advice he once received. Though Cranston can\u2019t quite remember exactly where he got it from, he says that outside of being kind, working hard and showing up on time, it's the best advice he's ever gotten.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as you dare to be bad, right? If you take chances that you could fall on your face, you could fail, it\u2019s that point that you can also turn and have it really work. So, don\u2019t play safe. Extend yourself, take chances, take risks and see what happens,\u201d Cranston tells TODAY.com.",
      "Is that the advice he gives his daughter, actor Taylor Dearden?",
      "\u201cFirst of all, as her dad, she does not want my direct advice,\u201d he says with a laugh about Dearden, whom he shares with wife Robin Dearden. The 32-year-old currently stars in the Max hospital drama \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d a role for which she\u2019s garnered glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cTaylor is a wonderful, hardworking actor,\u201d Cranston told Craig Melvin during a recent segment on TODAY. \u201cShe grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\u201d",
      "\u2018I Need to Outwork Everyone\u2019",
      "While Cranston may not dole out much career advice to Dearden, he tells TODAY.com that he does what he can to be a solid role model instead.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can relay to her is how I have been for her 32 years on this planet and try to live a good life and be an exemplar to her, as she can look at and say, \u2018Well, this is how he did things and that seemed to work for him.\u2019 Or, \u2018Oh, he tried that and that didn\u2019t work, so I\u2019m going to do something different,\u2019\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s basically it. Just live a true life and let your kids see that and hopefully they\u2019ll make their own proper decisions.\u201d",
      "That mindset likely comes from his parents, who Cranston says were instrumental in instilling his own work ethic.",
      "\u201cBoth my mother and father were hardworking people and they came from very humble, hardworking families, (they were) children during the Depression. It was, go out there every single day, try to find a job. That\u2019s what their parents were faced with. And so it carries on,\u201d says Cranston.",
      "With his parents as his example, Cranston says he learned early on that if he wanted to make a career out of acting, he needed to be fully committed.",
      "\u201cI realized as a young actor that there were always going to be actors who were better than me. At the same time, there were always going to be actors who weren\u2019t as good as me. And the only thing I can control is how hard I worked,\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cI know I can outwork people and that was my motto \u2014 I need to outwork everyone. So when I was a young actor, 22, 23, people were going out and they were partying every night. Not me. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to class. I\u2019m studying. I\u2019m learning monologues because I need to outwork everybody and I need to be ready.\u2019 And that was it, because this is what I wanted. I wanted a career as an actor.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s that advice that Cranston passes along to young actors hoping to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to commit.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018You\u2019re all in, go all in.\u2019 Because if you\u2019re not putting all of your energy into it, what are you waiting for? Why would you not? You've got to. And it still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be successful, just like a personal life. But you\u2019ve got to try, and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Trump had opposed Israeli action against Iran, but came to believe Israel had reason to act and that the U.S. would have to lend some support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced Friday.",
      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it \u201cfully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.\u201d"

      "As Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, prepare for a lavish, star-studded wedding in Venice, not everyone in the Italian city is happy about the impending nuptials.",
      "\"No space for Bezos,\" a sign read at a protest by residents who say the famed canal city is already overrun by tourists, billionaires or otherwise.",
      "Protesters say their issue is with the happy couple and authorities, like Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro, who said he was \"ashamed\" by the protests.",
      "\"We want to send a very clear message: The ones who should be ashamed are them,\" protester Federica Toninello told Reuters. \"They are the people who have destroyed this city.\"",
      "Venice\u2019s 2-square-mile main island and historic center, home to about 50,000 people, receives about 20 million visitors yearly, mostly day-trippers from cruise ships or other cities. While tourism is central to Venice\u2019s economy and cultural identity, critics say it has displaced residents and damaged historic sites.",

      "Brugnaro said that Bezos had \"achieved great things on a global level\" and that the city was \"extremely proud\" to host him.",
      "\"It is an honor that he is coming to Venice,\" he said.",
      "Though details of the Bezos-S\u00e1nchez wedding are top secret, according to Vogue, the guest list could include celebrities such as Eva Longoria, Katy Perry \u2014 S\u00e1nchez\u2019s crewmate on an April spaceflight by Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin \u2014 and at least some of the Kardashians.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, city hall officials said regular taxi and water transports would continue during the wedding festivities, which are reportedly set to begin June 24.",
      "Officials said only about 30 of the 280 water taxis have been reserved, and only three or four hotels will be used for the event.",
      "\"The city is fully accustomed to hosting high-profile events of this nature and scale, including other celebrity weddings, international summits such as the G7 and G20, as well as traditional events like the Festa del Redentore and the Venice Biennale,\" the statement said.",
      "City officials added that \"the celebrations, attended by 250 guests, will blend into the daily rhythm of a city that, with dignity and respect, welcomes thousands of visitors from around the world while safeguarding the quality of life for its residents, workers, and students.\"",
      "\"Protest initiatives are in no way representative of the majority of citizens, who are proud that Venice has been chosen as the wedding location,\" the statement added.",
      "Venice has a long history of hosting major events, including international summits and the 2014 wedding of actor George Clooney and human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin.",
      "\"Once again, Venice proves to be a world stage,\" Brugnaro said."

      "OTTAWA, Ontario \u2014 Britain\u2019s real-life spies have finally caught up with James Bond. MI6 has appointed its first female chief.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Sunday that Blaise Metreweli will be the next head of the U.K.\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, and the first woman to hold the post since its founding in 1909. She is currently the MI6 director of technology and innovation \u2014 the real-world equivalent of Bond gadget-master Q.",
      "A career intelligence officer, Metreweli, 47, steps from the shadows into the light as the only MI6 employee whose name is made public. She said \u201cI am proud and honored to be asked to lead my Service.\u201d",
      "Starmer said the \u201chistoric appointment\u201d comes at a time \u201cwhen the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital.",
      "\u201cThe United Kingdom is facing threats on an unprecedented scale \u2014 be it aggressors who send their spy ships to our waters or hackers whose sophisticated cyber plots seek to disrupt our public services,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer made the announcement as he arrived in the Canadian province of Alberta for a Group of Seven leaders\u2019 summit.",
      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2014 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller from 2002 to 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university. The agency\u2019s website stresses its family-friendly flexible working policy and goal of recruiting \u201ctalented people from all backgrounds.\u201d",
      "Moore suggested he would like his successor to be a woman. He wrote on X in 2023 that he would \u201chelp forge women\u2019s equality by working to ensure I\u2019m the last C selected from an all-male shortlist.\u201d",
      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view. It began with the country\u2019s top civil servant writing to government departments in March asking them to put forward candidates. The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women\u2019s rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6."

    "story": [
      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

Most of the population is displaced, and malnutrition is widespread.",

      "The senior military officers targeted had deep ties to Iran\u2019s regime and were known personally by the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, particularly Bagheri, according to Vatanka. Khamenei promoted Bagheri to his post as chief of the armed forces in 2016.",

      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."

      "The Israeli strikes took out a significant swath of Iran's top military leaders and senior scientists, as Israel unleashed more than 200 fighter jets across roughly 100 targets.

      "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that concerns over national security risks posed by Nippon Steel\u2019s $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel can be resolved if the companies fulfill certain conditions that his administration has laid out, paving the way for the deal\u2019s approval.",
      "Shares of U.S. Steel rose 3.5% on the news in after-the-bell trading as investors bet the deal was close to done. Trump, in an executive order, said conditions for resolving the national security concerns would be laid out in an agreement, without providing details. \u201cI additionally find that the threatened impairment to the national security of the United States arising as a result of the Proposed Transaction can be adequately mitigated if the conditions set forth in section 3 of this order are met,\u201d Trump said in the order, which was released by the White House.",
      "The companies thanked Trump in a news release, saying the agreement includes $11 billion in new investments to be made by 2028 and governance commitments including a golden share to be issued to the U.S. government. They did not detail how much control the golden share would give the U.S. Shares of U.S. Steel had dipped earlier on Friday after a Nippon Steel executive told the Japanese Nikkei newspaper that its planned takeover of U.S. Steel required \u201ca degree of management freedom\u201d to go ahead after Trump earlier had said the U.S. would be in control with a golden share.",
      "The bid, first announced by Nippon Steel in December 2023, has faced opposition from the start. Both Democratic former President Joe Biden and Trump, a Republican, asserted last year that U.S. Steel should remain U.S.-owned, as they sought to woo voters ahead of the presidential election in Pennsylvania, where the company is headquartered.",
      "Biden in January, shortly before leaving office, blocked the deal on national security grounds, prompting lawsuits by the companies, which argued the national security review they received was biased. The Biden White House disputed the charge.",
      "The steel companies saw a new opportunity in the Trump administration, which began on January 20 and opened a fresh 45-day national security review into the proposed merger in April.",
      "But Trump\u2019s public comments, ranging from welcoming a simple \u201cinvestment\u201d in U.S. Steel by the Japanese firm to floating a minority stake for Nippon Steel, spurred confusion.",
      "At a rally in Pennsylvania on May 30, Trump lauded an agreement between the companies and said Nippon Steel would make a \u201cgreat partner\u201d for U.S. Steel. But he later told reporters the deal still lacked his final approval, leaving unresolved whether he would allow Nippon Steel to take ownership.",
      "Nippon Steel and the Trump administration asked a U.S. appeals court on June 5 for an eight-day extension of a pause in litigation to give them more time to reach a deal for the Japanese firm. The pause expires Friday, but could be extended.",
      "June 18 is the expiration date of the current acquisition contract between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, but the firms could agree to postpone that date."

    "summary": "Israel's latest action pits traditional Republican support for Israel \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base's fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war.",
    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "But three U.S. officials told NBC News later Friday that the U.S. is assisting in shooting down Iranian missiles and projectiles targeting Israel. The Pentagon also moved a number of military assets into the region in recent days to support the operation, according to another U.S. official.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"
