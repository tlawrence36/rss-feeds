      "PARIS -- The Louvre in Paris reopened fully on Friday after staff voted to suspend a strike that had disrupted access to the world\u2019s most visited museum, management and unions said.",
      "The decision was taken during a general assembly of museum workers, who voted unanimously to pause the strike to allow the museum to welcome visitors, unions said in a statement. The walkout had led to a full closure earlier in the week and a partial reopening on Wednesday.",
      "Unions said the suspension followed five meetings with Culture Ministry officials but said progress remains insufficient, particularly on staffing levels, pay and long-term security plans. They also cited concerns over building deterioration and working conditions.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "Arnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.",
      "He was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military\u2019s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.",
      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China\u2019s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",
      "\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a \u2014 you know \u2014 enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.",
      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",
      "Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.",
      "Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.",
      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\u201d",

      "The Brazilian film \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d is opening nationwide in U.S. theaters",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s \u2014 not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,\u201d star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how authoritarianism works everywhere.\u201d",
      "Directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d has been hailed by critics as one of the year\u2019s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendon\u00e7a Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).",
      "Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won this year\u2019s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.",
      "In Brazil, expectations for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film \u2014 and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists \u2014 has made him \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo country develops without culture, without identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.\u201d",
      "Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d opens with a black-and-white montage of the era\u2019s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all consumed incredible things from so many places \u2014 from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cI am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it\u2019s good, it will be universal.\u201d",
      "Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother\u2019s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry \u2014 a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.",
      "One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director\u2019s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cThe Omen,\u201d shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.",
      "Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as \u201cMarighella,\u201d directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.",
      "Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.",
      "\u201cThe military is a trauma that was never truly examined,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Move on, forget it.\u2019 A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.\u201d",

      "Few stories in \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are as striking as that of T\u00e2nia Maria, 78, who plays Dona Sebastiana.",
      "A Brazilian artisan, Maria lived an ordinary life until age 72, when she was cast as an extra in Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s 2019 film \u201cBacurau.\u201d Since then, she has appeared in six films that have yet to be released.",
      "The director said he never forgot her presence \u2014 \u201ca birdlike bearing, a voice shaped by 60 years of cigarettes and a razor-sharp sense of humor.\u201d He later wrote the role of Dona Sebastiana specifically for her.",
      "The character, who shelters political fugitives including Armando, stands out. When she walks toward the camera in a flowered dress, cigarette in hand, the film briefly belongs to her.",
      "\u201cHer authenticity carries something of many women I\u2019ve known,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cThere\u2019s something literary about her.\u201d",
      "Moura said he wasn't able to hide his awe at the actor\u2019s authenticity. He pointed to their first scene together, in which Dona Sebastiana shows Armando the apartment he is moving into.",
      "If viewers watch closely, he said, they will see that he is genuinely \u201clike a fool orbiting around her.\u201d",

      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material.

It was led by Academy Award-winning songwriter Paul Williams. Summer's husband, Bruce Sudano and their daughters Brooklyn Sudano and Amanda Sudano Ramirez were in attendance.",
      "\u201cDonna Summer is not only one of the defining voices and performers of the 20th century; she is one of the great songwriters of all time who changed the course of music,\u201d said Williams in a statement. \u201cShe wrote timeless and transcendent songs that continue to captivate our souls and imaginations, inspiring the world to dance and, above all, feel love.\u201d",
      "Summer's smooth blend of R&B, soul, pop, funk, rock, disco and electronica launched numerous chart-topping hits in the \u201870s and \u201980s as well as three multiplatinum albums. She won five Grammys. She was unstoppable \u2014 both as a performer and a writer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to me because I know how important it was for Donna,\u201d said Sudano in a press release. \u201cThe backstory is, with all the accolades that she received over her career, being respected as a songwriter was always the thing that she felt was overlooked. So, for her to be accepted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame I know that she\u2019s very happy \u2026 somewhere.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song.",

      "Faith-based films are gaining traction in Hollywood, with recent successes sparking renewed interest",
      "LOS ANGELES -- At the movies this fall, Josh O\u2019Connor plays a hot priest with a complicated past, Keanu Reeves is an angel who lost his wings and Elizabeth Olsen has a romantic dilemma in the afterlife.",
      "Hollywood, it seems, has found God.",
      "But it\u2019s not just starry big-budget Netflix films or A24 indies that are grappling with religion and its place in entertainment. In recent years, there\u2019s been an explosion of films and television made from a confessional perspective that evangelize or portray a particular faith, often Christianity, that have performed particularly well with audiences.",
      "There are animated biblical films from Angel, like the upcoming musical \u201cDavid,\u201d which the company said has already exceeded $14 million in theatrical pre-sale tickets ahead of its release this Friday, to docudramas like Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Saints.\u201d While episodes from Season 2 are still being released, the first season of the Fox Nation series, which premiered last year, was the most watched on the platform.",
      "\u201cThere has been a revival, a revolution of sorts, of spirituality and faith content,\u201d proclaimed Traci Blackwell, head of targeted content for Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios, at a recent Variety event in Beverly Hills for faith and spirituality in entertainment. Earlier this year, Amazon premiered the first season of its own biblical drama, \u201cHouse of David,\u201d and gained exclusive U.S. streaming rights to \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d a massively popular drama series about the life of Jesus.",
      "Historically some faith-based entertainment has performed well at the box office \u2014 Mel Gibson\u2019s 2004 epic \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d was notoriously the highest-grossing R-rated film in the U.S. and Canada for two decades. But faith-based hits have been few and far between for most of this century.",
      "\u201cHollywood has taken a lot of criticism by those in the faith community for not providing films that speak to them, that reflect their values,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst, emphasizing the box-office potential of faith-based films.",
      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",
      "\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to watch it,\u201d recalled Angel CEO and co-founder Neal Harmon. \u201cPeople have this idea that faith means cheesy or preachy. And we had to break through that barrier.\u201d",
      "Once they did, it paid off. Since Fathom Entertainment began distributing \u201cThe Chosen\u201d theatrically in 2023, the series has grossed more than $116 million domestically.",
      "Though not a Christian company, Angel aims to distribute and market \u201cvalues-based entertainment\u201d that includes but is not limited to stories of faith. They\u2019ve released a host of religious films, with \u201cZero A.D.,\u201d a biblical epic about the Massacre of the Innocents recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, on the docket for 2026.",
      "Meanwhile, Lionsgate is set to premiere \u201cI Can Only Imagine 2\u201d in theaters February, a sequel to the 2018 biopic starring Dennis Quaid, which was one of the highest-grossing Christian films of all-time in the United States.",
      "Co-director Andrew Erwin said he noticed a \u201cmassive shift\u201d take place about five years ago, after years of disconnect between the demand for these kinds of films and Hollywood\u2019s willingness to make them.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, movie studios are really giving us a fair shake,\u201d he said, though he thinks the quality of the content was also a factor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the knowledge of how to do the filmmaking side of things. And so, I think the storytelling has gotten a lot better.\u201d",
      "Lionsgate is also set to distribute the first of Gibson\u2019s two-part sequel to \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d in 2027.",

But in all the acclaim and Oscar buzz surrounding the film, there\u2019s little talk of its engagement with faith.",
      "Even Scorsese\u2019s 1988 \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d or filmmaker Paul Schrader\u2019s Oscar-nominated \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d which also stars Seyfried, are hardly thought of broadly as Christian films, despite the fact that both men have been outspoken about their respective traditions.",
      "\u201cThis film was his way of exploring his faith and exploring who his God is,\u201d Scorsese\u2019s daughter Francesca, who directed one of the episodes of \u201cThe Saints,\u201d said of \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ.\u201d",

      "For studios and filmmakers, acknowledging that a project is told from a religious perspective can be a double-edged sword.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re buying in on going to the movie theater for a faith-based movie, you know you\u2019re gonna have people around you who are really into the experience,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThe minute you say faith-based though, it kind of puts a movie in a box.\u201d",
      "Many Christians celebrate the trend beyond its monetary potential. Phil Wickham, a Grammy-nominated Christian recording artist who voices the character of David in the upcoming Angel film, said it\u2019s been gratifying to see the success of shows like \u201cThe Chosen\u201d and \u201cHouse of David.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, anything that was Christian media felt so preachy,\u201d Wickham said. \u201cEven as a pastor\u2019s kid, it was a turn off. But now I think there\u2019s just more opportunity to tell bigger stories over the course of a series and more people willing to really dig in and tell something with excellence and beauty.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s too soon to tell whether there's been a sea change in Hollywood or if it's a short-term fad, the success of some of these projects has stood out amid an otherwise perilous time in the business.",

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

      "Horror stories were popular on radio in the late '30s, Bak says. Williams first thought of radio plays as an \u201cexercise,\u201d but he would eventually take them more seriously. While writing \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d he was already haunted by the mental health struggles of his sister, Rose, who would later inspire the fragile Laura Wingfield of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Williams would long explore the idea of madness, Bak says, and how we respond to people who seem to see things \u201cno one else can see.\u201d",

      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Jowon Briggs was sitting in a New York Jets special teams meeting earlier this season when Chris Banjo turned to him and made a request.",
      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York. He has 28 total tackles, six tackles for loss, a forced fumble, three sacks and nine quarterback hits.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",
      "Briggs grew up in Cincinnati with four older sisters, a younger brother and parents who all loved music and sports, making for a seamless duet of life-long passions.",
      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",
      "There were times one sibling would start playing an instrument, another would join, someone would start singing and then another would harmonize.",
      "\u201cWe had a very loud house,\u201d a smiling Briggs said. \u201cIt was kind of like \u2018Battle of the Bands.\u2019 It was a lot of fun. My sisters all sing better than I can, but if you grow up in that kind of competitive household, you find out if you can sing or not fairly quickly. So I was able to figure out that I was decent.\u201d",

That carried over to Walnut Hills High School, where he got the lead role as Coalhouse Walker Jr. in \u201cRagtime\u201d and performed in other productions.

      "When he got to the University of Virginia as a physics and music double-major, he joined the school's University Singers and its chamber choir, which performed around Charlottesville. Briggs also was part of an a cappella group called The Hullabahoos that went to London in 2020 just before the COVID-19 pandemic and sang at schools, churches, pubs and sometimes right on the streets.",

      "The ongoing strike at the Louvre has become a major test of the museum's management",
      "PARIS -- The ongoing strike at the Louvre is no longer just a labor dispute. It has become a test of how securely, credibly and competently the world\u2019s most visited museum is being run.",
      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",
      "The October daylight robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels, intensified scrutiny from lawmakers and auditors and reframing workplace complaints as questions of institutional failure.",
      "Culture Ministry officials have tried to defuse the standoff by proposing to cancel a planned 2026 funding cut, hire additional guards and visitor services staff, and raise pay. Unions rejected the measures as inadequate, signaling that trust has frayed beyond quick fixes.",
      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",
      "French senators were told last week that thieves who stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million escaped the Louvre with barely 30 seconds to spare, a detail that crystallized the scale of the breakdown.",
      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",
      "When the alarm finally sounded, police were initially sent to the wrong location, investigators said, a delay that proved decisive.",
      "\u201cGive or take 30 seconds, guards or police could have intercepted them,\u201d said No\u00ebl Corbin, who led the inquiry.",

      "For staff now on strike, the Senate findings confirmed what they say they had warned for years: that the museum\u2019s defenses were thin, its warnings unheeded, and its margin for error measured in seconds.",
      "The heist has sharpened attention on the Louvre\u2019s condition. Parts of the vast complex have been closed after officials discovered structural weaknesses, including nine rooms in the Campana Gallery devoted to ancient Greek ceramics. Technical reports cited \u201cparticular fragility\u201d in supporting beams, forcing staff relocations and closures until further notice.",
      "Unions say sections of the centuries-old building are in \u201cvery poor condition,\u201d pointing to incidents such as a November water leak that damaged hundreds of historic books as signs of broader neglect.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s \u201cNew Renaissance\u201d renovation plan, launched in early 2025 to modernize the Louvre and manage overcrowding, includes expanded entrances and major upgrades. Critics say it has moved too slowly and focused too heavily on headline projects. A court audit flagged considerable delays in deploying modern security equipment and found that only a fraction of allocated funds had been spent on safety.",
      "A proposal to give Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cMona Lisa\u201d a dedicated room with its own entrance was intended to ease crushing crowds. Instead, it has become a symbol of what workers see as misplaced priorities.",
      "Backed by Macron, the plan would separate the painting from the Salle des \u00c9tats to improve visitor flow. Supporters say it reflects the reality of mass tourism, with most visitors coming primarily to see the \u201cMona Lisa.\u201d",
      "Unions counter that the project highlights a fixation on blockbuster attractions while staffing shortages, infrastructure decay and security gaps persist. They argue that money earmarked for redesign would be better spent on repairs, surveillance upgrades and front-line staffing. Some also fear the move could open the door to tiered access or higher prices.",
      "Former Louvre director Jean-Luc Martinez told senators this week that he believed the museum\u2019s security plan was sufficient, stopping short of accepting personal responsibility for failures exposed by the heist.",
      "Martinez, who led the Louvre from 2013 to 2021, said he was \u201cstruck, shaken and wounded\u201d by the robbery and insisted security had been a priority during his tenure. Lawmakers pressed him on why vulnerabilities identified in earlier audits, including a 2019 review of the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, were not addressed.",
      "He acknowledged delays to a broader 54-million-euro security overhaul, with contracts \u201csupposed to be launched in 2022.\u201d When told his successor later judged the plan incomplete, Martinez replied: \u201cI thought this plan was sufficient.\u201d",

      "Alex Warren's song \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025",
      "New York -- It jolted the winter, came alive in the spring, dominated the summer and went three-times platinum in the fall. Alex Warren's bombastic ballad \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025. It's also an unusual hit: slower than a traditional song of the summer, full of gloss, an ascendent hook and inoffensive, religious-adjacent lyricism.",
      "For those reasons, \u201cOrdinary\u201d has fast-tracked the 25-year-old singer/songwriter into mainstream musical fame, coming to a head in November when he earned his first Grammy nomination. The nomination for best new artist arrived just four months after the release of his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI bawled in my wife's arms,\u201d he said of the moment he found out about the nomination. For those who didn't believe in his music career, he says, \u201cthe biggest justification ever was the nomination.\u201d",
      "Most know Warren for \u201cOrdinary,\u201d but fame is not new for him. Before the chart-topping hit, Warren made a name for himself as a social media prankster in the TikTok collective \u201cHype House.\u201d And while that past might seem at odds with his new public persona, Warren always exuded perspicacity, the result of a troubled childhood that separated him from his comedic cohort. His father died of cancer when he was 9, he says, and his mother of complications due to alcoholism. A period of homelessness followed in his teens, before the TikTok fame.",
      "Still, he's remained curious and playful. At The Associated Press headquarters in New York, he chatted with staff and made disarming, self-deprecating comments. An example: In preparation to see the singer Shawn Mendes later, he dosed himself in cologne. \u201cI need to smell as good as Shawn Mendes looks,\u201d he joked.",
      "Social media success doesn't always yield a creative career \u2014 consider Warren and the innovative Addison Rae, a fellow best new artist nominee, exceptions to the rule \u2014 but it did prime him for the life he leads now. \u201cEverything that I went through back then definitely allowed me to do this,\u201d he says.",
      "Growing up online \u2014 and having \u201cdifferent versions\u201d of himself presented on social media \u2014 has \u201cdefinitely allowed me to now be unequivocally myself,\u201d he says.",
      "Warren wrote \u201cOrdinary\u201d a year ago at a writing camp. He says he knew there was something special about the track \u2014 though he and his collaborators were mostly alone in that feeling. \u201cA lot of people were like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a ballad, it\u2019s a love song ballad. That\u2019s not a single, that\u2019s a song on the album. That\u2019s a feature, you should give it to someone else,\u2019\u201d he recalls. But he pushed it on TikTok, and soon, it connected.",
      "\u201cThe TikToks got it to do 4 million streams in a day, which was crazy,\u201d he said. Then he performed it on Netflix's \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d He played it with Ed Sheeran,Jelly Roll, Luke Combs and the Jonas Brothers. It built to ubiquity.",

      "NEW YORK -- Rapper Kay Flock was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in prison for a series of shootings in his Bronx neighborhood, derailing a music career that was just taking off before his 2021 arrest.",
      "The 22-year-old rapper, whose real name is Kevin Perez, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis J. Liman, who criticized Perez for sending the wrong message to his young peers by glorifying violence during a less-than-18-month stretch from 2020 to 2021 that prosecutors said left dozens of people on Bronx streets shot at, injured or killed.",
      "\u201cYou taunted, you celebrated and you helped create a cycle of violence,\u201d Liman said, noting that Perez bragged on social media that he was exonerated on the top count and wrote \u201cKILL ALL RATS\u201d on Instagram after a trial in which gang members testified against him.",
      "The judge called Perez a \u201cman of promise\u201d but said a lengthy prison sentence was necessary for four separate shootings that injured multiple people while he led a gang known as \u201cSev Side/DOA.\u201d Perez was convicted in March of charges including racketeering conspiracy and attempted murder.",
      "Perez insisted that he had changed, saying: \u201cWhat I was at 18 is not what I am today.\u201d",
      "Saying everyone deserves a second chance, he added: \u201cI was just a kid. Didn't really know better.\u201d",
      "But Liman criticized him for not expressing any concern for his victims.",
      "\u201cTo date, you've shown no real remorse for your conduct,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Perez was named Billboard Magazine\u2019s R&B/Hip-Hop Rookie of the Month in November, 2021, following the release of his first album: \u201cThe D.O.A. Tape.\u201d It put him on the map as a newcomer in New York's drill rap scene, which features performers who wield weapons and lyrics containing slang about violence.",

      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.",

      "Jha said authorities are not being honest about the problem and that there is a lack of political will to address the issue.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s more headline and image management than pollution management,\u201d he said, adding that the high levels of pollution have been treated as normal by political leaders.",

      "Missouri\u2019s top prosecutor says China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on a roughly $25 billion court judgment related to the COVID-19 pandemic",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Missouri's top prosecutor said China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on a roughly $25 billion court judgment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said Tuesday in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Wuhan. The Chinese government also is seeking compensation equivalent to $50.5 billion plus legal fees and the right to claim further compensation.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",
      "Last month, Missouri escalated its efforts to collect, asking the U.S. State Department to formally notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment.",
      "Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of the new case. But he said the earlier Missouri lawsuit was \u201ca purely politically motivated maneuver.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes it, will never accept it, and reserves the right to take strong countermeasures,\u201d Pengyu said.",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier this year that its actions during the pandemic aren\u2019t subject to U.S. jurisdiction and it doesn\u2019t recognize the ruling.",
      "Some legal experts have cast doubt on whether Missouri can collect on the judgment, because federal law generally shields foreign nations from lawsuits in U.S. courts.",

      "The case has taken an unusual path. U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed the lawsuit in 2022, saying Missouri couldn\u2019t sue China, its Communist Party and seven other government or scientific agencies. But an appeals court allowed one part of the lawsuit to proceed: the allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment, such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.",
      "After Chinese officials didn\u2019t respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri\u2019s estimate of past and potential future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until it\u2019s collected.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, an ally of President Donald Trump who subsequently won election to the U.S. Senate, and alleged that Chinese officials were to blame for the pandemic. It was carried on by Attorney General Andrew Bailey, another Trump ally who resigned in September to become co-deputy director of the FBI.",
      "Hanaway, a former U.S. attorney and Missouri House speaker, inherited the case when she was appointed state attorney general by Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe.",
      "The Associated Press wasn't immediately able to obtain its own copy of the Chinese-filed complaint. But a copy was linked to Hanaway's news release.",
      "The complaint accuses Missouri, as well as Schmitt and Bailey, of \u201cfabricating enormous disinformation, and spreading stigmatizing and discriminating slanders\u201d that have harmed China's reputation.",
      "Schmitt said he would wear the suit \u201clike a badge of honor\u201d and accused Chinese authorities of \u201cattempting to absolve themselves of all wrongdoing in the early days of the pandemic.\u201d",

      "\u201cTo be stuck in the hospital and feel like the world is moving on without you outside feels a little bit isolating, a little lonely, feels like maybe you\u2019ve been forgotten in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season,\u201d said Amanda Lefkof, a child life specialist at Corewell.",
      "Among the children in the hospital is 4-year-old Zoe Hostetter, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatments. On a recent night, she shone her own flashlight toward the bundled-up well-wishers below with her grandfather, Tim Schuele, by her side.",

      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",

      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",

      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",

      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Two former senior officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including one fired by the Trump administration, will join California as public health consultants, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday.",
      "Susan Monarez was fired as the CDC\u2019s director and Dr. Debra Houry resigned as the agency\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director over disputes about changes at the agency. The two will work with California's public health department to help build trust in \u201cscience-driven decision-making,\u201d Newsom's office said.",
      "\u201cWe're not just wringing our hands right now \u2014 we're fighting back,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference. \u201cThis is a substantive response to what is not happening in Washington.\u201d",
      "California has increasingly positioned itself as a counterweight to federal health policy, and Newsom has amped up his criticisms of President Donald Trump and challenged the Republican's policies in court. The governor's final term ends in just over a year, and he's gearing up for a possible presidential run in 2028.",
      "California joined Washington and Oregon \u2014 two other states with Democratic governors \u2014 to launch an alliance in September to establish their own public health guidance and vaccine recommendations, as the Trump administration makes sweeping changes to vaccine and health policy.",
      "California state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican, said the initiative announced Monday is an example of Newsom prioritizing his national political ambitions over the state.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has serious problems, and we need serious solutions from a serious leader,\u201d Strickland said in a statement.",
      "The White House and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to emails seeking comment on the Monarez and Houry hirings.",
      "Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeated falsehoods about vaccines, and the administration has given health recommendations this year that experts say were not backed by science.",
      "Trump in September urged pregnant women not to take Tylenol, saying it could pose a risk of autism to their babies, remarks medical experts said were irresponsible. The CDC website was changed last month to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. A federal vaccine advisory panel voted earlier this month to reverse decades-old guidance recommending that all U.S. babies get immunized against the liver infection hepatitis B on the day they're born. The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",
      "Setting polite boundaries with guests who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products is also a good idea, she said.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s office says Canada and the U.S. will launch formal discussions to review the free trade agreement in mid-January",
      "TORONTO -- Canada and the U.S. will launch formal discussions to review their free trade agreement in mid-January, the office of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said.",
      "The prime minister confirmed to provincial leaders that Dominic LeBlanc, the country\u2019s point person for U.S-Canada trade relations, \u201cwill meet with U.S. counterparts in mid-January to launch formal discussions,\" Carney\u2019s office said in a statement late Thursday.",
      "The United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact, or USMCA, is up for review in 2026. U.S. President Donald Trump negotiated the deal in his first term and included a clause to possibly renegotiate the deal in 2026.",
      "Carney met with the leaders of Canada\u2019s provinces on Thursday to give them an update on trade talks with the U.S.",
      "Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and more than 75% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the country's southern neighbor. But most exports to the U.S. are currently exempted by USMCA.",
      "Trump cut off trade talks to reduce tariffs on certain sectors with Carney in October after the Ontario provincial government ran an anti-tariff advertisement in the U.S. That followed a spring of acrimony, since abated, over Trump\u2019s insistence that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
      "Carney said earlier Thursday that Canada and the U.S. were close to an agreement at the time on sectoral tariff relief in multiple areas, including steel and aluminum. Tariffs are taking a toll on certain sectors of Canada's economy, particularly aluminum, steel, auto and lumber.",
      "Carney also said trade irritants flagged this week by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are elements of a \u201cmuch bigger discussion\u201d about continental trade. Greer said a coming review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade deal will hinge on resolving U.S. concerns about Canadian policies on dairy products, alcohol and digital services.",

      "Russia previously has deployed tactical nuclear weapons to the territory of its Belarus, whose territory it used to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Lukashenko has earlier said that his country has several dozen Russian tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Russia first tested a conventionally armed version of the Oreshnik \u2014 Russian for hazelnut tree \u2014 to strike a Ukrainian factory in November 2024, and Putin has boasted that it\u2019s impossible to intercept. He has warned the West that Russia could use it next against allies of Kyiv that allowed it to strike inside Russia with their longer-range missiles.",
      "The Russian leader has bragged that Oreshnik\u2019s multiple warheads plunge at speeds of up to Mach 10 and can\u2019t be intercepted, and that several of them used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack. Russian state media boasted that it would take the missile only 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO headquarters in Brussels. There\u2019s no way to know whether it\u2019s carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.",

      "In 2024, the Kremlin released a revised nuclear doctrine, noting that any nation\u2019s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal.",

      "The population of the Lesser Antillean iguana, also known as Iguana delicatissima, was zero on Prickly Pear East Cay nearly a decade ago.",
      "But scientists in nearby Anguilla who were determined to save the species from extinction tucked 10 iguanas into small, breathable cotton bags and ferried them by boat to the cay with no predators in hopes they would breed.",
      "And breed they did. The population has surged to 300 and counting, converting the cay into one of five sites worldwide where the iguana is trying to make a comeback. It is estimated that there are fewer than 20,000 species remaining, according to conservation groups.",
      "\u201cPrickly Pear East has become a beacon of hope for these gorgeous lizards and proves that when we give native wildlife the chance, they know what to do,\u201d said Jenny Daltry, Caribbean alliance director for the conservation groups Fauna & Flora and Re:wild.",
      "Indigenous people are estimated to have arrived in the eastern Caribbean roughly 7,000 years ago.",
      "The Lesser Antillean iguanas were already there, likely having reached the islands by floating atop debris spewed by rivers that had burst their banks in South America, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "At the time, the iguanas inhabited some 10 islands, but they are now extinct on Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Martin, and have largely vanished from Guadeloupe, St. Barts and Martinique, according to the Re:wild conservation group.",
      "Its biggest threat? The green, or stripe-tailed, iguana. Originally from Central and South America, it was introduced to Guadeloupe in the 1800s and then spread to other islands thanks to Hurricane Luis, which pummeled the northeast Caribbean in 1995.",
      "The green iguanas have more offspring, they are more territorial and they eat more food than the Lesser Antillean iguanas.",

      "Lesser Antillean iguanas are bright green when young but morph into a slate gray or dusty black as adults, with a lifespan of more than 20 years in the wild.",
      "But concerns remained despite the successful breeding.",
      "Scientists reached out to officials in the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica to obtain more female iguanas in a bid to boost the genetic diversity of the lizards procreating in Prickly Pear East. Dominica has the region's largest population of Lesser Antillean iguanas, but they too are now threatened by green iguanas that arrived after Hurricane Maria hit the region in 2017.",
      "The petition was sent during the pandemic, so Carter and other scientists had to quarantine first before traveling to Dominica. Once there, they built homes for the captured iguanas, monitored their health and ran DNA tests to make sure they weren\u2019t hybrid iguanas.",

      "\u201cThose are the ones you remember the most,\u201d he said, adding that he nicknamed one of them \u201cGreen.\u201d",
      "The captured iguanas were then flown out of Dominica in a special type of pillowcase and boxes with lots of breathing holes and landed in Anguilla, where they were then whisked by boat to Prickly Pear East.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's lower house speaker Hugo Motta decided on Thursday to remove two lawmakers close to former President Jair Bolsonaro from their seats in the latest blow to the far-right leader serving a 27-year jail sentence for leading a coup attempt.",
      "One of Bolsonaro's sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and the former head of Brazil's intelligence agency, Alexandre Ramagem, were stripped off their seats for different reasons. The decision was published in the journal of Brazil's lower house.",
      "Since his move to Texas in February, Eduardo Bolsonaro has missed more than 80% of this year's lower house sessions, which violates its rules. The 41-year-old claims to be politically persecuted at home, and has lobbied members of the Trump administration to help his father reverse his conviction and put pressure on President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "\"As everybody knows, he is living abroad by his own decision,\" Motta told journalists after his decision was announced. \u201cHe has not attended our house's sessions and it is impossible to serve one's term as a lawmaker if that person is not in our territory.\u201d",
      "The removal of Ramagem, who recently fled to the U.S. to avoid serving his 16-year jail sentence in the same case that put Bolsonaro behind bars in November, had been ordered by Brazil's Supreme Court. Earlier this month, Motta, who has often sided with Bolsonaro allies, said he was going to put the decision to remove Ramagem from his seat to a full-house vote.",
      "If Eduardo Bolsonaro returns to Brazil, he will face a trial on charges of obstructing justice in connection with his father\u2019s attempted coup case. The former president's son was accused of using violence or serious threats to interfere with a legal proceeding. If convicted, he could face one to four years in prison and a fine.",
      "Neither Eduardo Bolsonaro nor Alexandre Ramagem made comments about losing their seats.",

      "Brazil\u2019s Senate has passed a bill that could reduce former President Jair Bolsonaro's 27-year prison sentence",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil\u2019s Senate has passed a bill that could significantly reduce the 27-year prison sentence of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who was arrested in November for attempting a coup.",
      "The Chamber of Deputies had already approved the text, and it now goes to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva for signature.",
      "Gleisi Hoffmann, Minister of Institutional Relations, said Wednesday evening that Lula will veto the bill.",
      "\u201cThose convicted of attacking democracy must pay for their crimes,\u201d Hoffmann said on X, calling it a \u201csign of disrespect for the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and a serious setback to legislation that protects democracy.\u201d",
      "The text is also expected to be challenged at the Supreme Court.",
      "The bill reduces the final sentences of defendants convicted under multiple charges stemming from the coup attempt, including Bolsonaro.",
      "The former president\u2019s lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court after his conviction, saying his prison term was excessive. They also argued that the sentences for abolishing the rule of law and attempting a coup should not be added because they arose from a single episode.",
      "The proposed law would speed up sentence progression from harsher to more lenient prison regimes for those convicted.",
      "There is no consensus on how much time Bolsonaro would actually serve if the bill takes effect. Under current rules, the former president could move to a less restrictive prison system after 7 years if he met legal requirements while incarcerated.",
      "Paulinho da For\u00e7a, the bill\u2019s rapporteur in the Chamber of Deputies, has estimated that period could be cut to just over two years if the law passes.",
      "The bill would also allow sentence reductions of up to two-thirds for crimes committed in a crowd, benefiting defendants convicted of storming public buildings during the Jan. 8, 2023, insurrection in Brasilia.",

      "ROME -- Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world\u2019s most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro ($2.35) fee for tourists to get close to the fountain made famous by Federico Fellini\u2019s \u201cLa Dolce Vita\u201d during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City\u2019s efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome\u2019s cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city 6.5 million euros ($7.6 million) extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome\u2019s Pantheon monument and the more complicated tourist day-tripper tax that the lagoon city of Venice imposed last year in a bid to ease overtourism and make the city more liveable for residents.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro (nearly $6) tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",

      "At the same time, he said, the 2-euro ($2.35) Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela\u2019s coast is raising new concerns about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela\u2019s coast is raising new questions about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America, while fueling concerns that the U.S. could be edging closer to war.",
      "The Trump administration says its blockade is narrowly tailored and not targeting civilians, which would be an illegal act of war. But some experts say seizing sanctioned oil tied to leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro could provoke a military response from Venezuela, engaging American forces in a new level of conflict that goes beyond their attacks on alleged drug boats.",
      "\u201cMy biggest fear is this is exactly how wars start and how conflicts escalate out of control,\u201d said Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cAnd there are no adults in the room with this administration, nor is there consultation with Congress. So I\u2019m very worried.\u201d",
      "Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania, said the use of such an aggressive tactic without congressional authority stretches the bounds of international law and increasingly looks like a veiled attempt to trigger a Venezuelan response.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that we are bootstrapping our way into armed conflict,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re upping the ante in order to try to get them to engage in an act of aggression that would then justify an act of self-defense on our part.\u201d",
      "Trump has used the word \u201cblockade\u201d to describe his latest tactic in an escalating pressure campaign against Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. and now has been accused of using oil profits to fund drug trafficking. While Trump said it only applies to vessels facing U.S. economic penalties, the move has sparked outrage among Democrats and mostly shrugs, if not cheers, from Republicans.",
      "Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said Trump going after sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela is no different from targeting Iranian oil.",
      "\u201cJust like with the Iranian shadow tankers, I have no problem with that,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re circumventing sanctions.\u201d",
      "The president has declared the U.S. is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels in an effort to reduce the flow of drugs to American communities. U.S. forces have attacked 28 alleged drug-smuggling boats and killed at least 104 people since early September. Trump has repeatedly promised that land strikes are next, while linking Maduro to the cartels.",
      "The campaign has drawn scrutiny in Congress, particularly after it was revealed that U.S. forces killed two survivors of a boat attack with a follow-up strike. But Republicans so far have repeatedly declined to require congressional authorization for further military action in the region, blocking Democrats' war powers resolutions.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker, Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee, has essentially ended his panel\u2019s investigation into the Sept. 2 strike, saying Thursday that the entire campaign is being conducted \u201con sound legal advice.\u201d",
      "Trump announced the blockade Tuesday, about a week after U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela\u2019s coast. The South American country has the world\u2019s largest proven oil reserves and relies heavily on the revenue to support its economy.",
      "The U.S. has been imposing sanctions on Venezuela since 2005 over concerns about corruption as well as criminal and anti-democratic activities. The first Trump administration expanded the penalties to oil, prompting Maduro\u2019s government to rely on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains.",
      "The state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, has been largely locked out of global oil markets by U.S. sanctions. It sells most of its exports at a steep discount on the black market in China.",
      "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Guerra, Maduro's son and a lawmaker, on Thursday decried Trump\u2019s latest tactic and vowed to work with the private sector to limit any impact on the country\u2019s oil-dependent economy. He acknowledged that it won\u2019t be an easy task.",
      "\u201cWe value peace and dialogue, but the reality right now is that we are being threatened by the most powerful army in the world, and that\u2019s not something to be taken lightly,\u201d Maduro Guerra said.",

      "A defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to outline internal reasoning about the policy, said a blockade, under international law, constitutes an act of war requiring formal declaration and enforcement against all incoming and outgoing traffic. A quarantine, however, is a selective, preventive security measure that targets specific, illegal activity.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was unsure of the legality of Trump's blockade.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re blockading apparently the oil industry, not the entire country,\u201d said Smith, who represents parts of western Washington state. \u201cHow does that change things? I got to talk to some lawyers, but in general, a blockade is an act of war.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has a long history of leveraging naval sieges to pressure lesser powers, especially in the 19th century era of \u201cgunboat diplomacy,\u201d sometimes provoking them into taking action that triggers an even greater American response.",
      "But in recent decades, as the architecture of international law has developed, successive U.S. administrations have been careful not to use such maritime shows of force because they are seen as punishing civilians \u2014 an illegal act of aggression outside of wartime.",

      "Mark Nevitt, an Emory University law professor and former Navy judge advocate general, said there is a legal basis for the U.S. to board and seize an already-sanctioned ship that is deemed to be stateless or is claiming two states.",
      "But a blockade, he said, is a \u201cwartime naval operation and maneuver\u201d designed to block the access of vessels and aircraft of an enemy state.",
      "\u201cI think the blockade is predicated on a false legal pretense that we are at war with narcoterrorists,\u201d he said.",
      "Nevitt added: \u201cThis seems to be almost like a junior varsity blockade, where they\u2019re trying to assert a wartime legal tool, a blockade, but only doing it selectively.\u201d",
      "Geoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army\u2019s senior adviser for law-of-war issues and has been critical of the Trump administration\u2019s boat strikes, said he was not convinced the blockade was intended to ratchet up the conflict with Venezuela.",
      "Instead, he suggested it could be aimed at escalating the pressure on Maduro to give up power or encouraging his supporters to back away from him.",
      "\u201cYou can look at it through the lens of, is this an administration trying to create a pretext for a broader conflict?\u201d Corn said. \u201cOr you can look at it as part of an overall campaign of pressuring the Maduro regime to step aside.\u201d",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage edged lower this week, staying relatively close to its low for the year.",
      "The decline brings the average long-term mortgage rate to 6.21% from 6.22% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.72%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week. The rate averaged 5.47%, down from 5.54% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.92%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.12% at midday Thursday, unchanged from a week ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been mostly holding steady in recent weeks since it dropped to 6.17%, its lowest level in more than a year, on Oct. 30.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month. An encouraging report on inflation on Thursday could give the central bank cause to keep cutting interest rates next year.",
      "The Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don\u2019t always translate into lower mortgage rates. That\u2019s what happened in the fall of 2024 after the central bank cut its main rate for the first time in more than four years. Instead of falling, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually cresting above 7% in January this year. At that time, the 10-year Treasury yield was climbing toward 5%.",

Home listings are up sharply from last year, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cMortgage rates have eased into the low-6% range and inventory remains well above last year\u2019s levels, giving buyers more options and greater flexibility,\u201d said Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com.",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for many aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market are also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Homeowners eager to refinance their home loan to a lower rate have benefited from easing mortgage rates.",
      "Applications for mortgage refinance loans made up 59% of all home loan applications last week, the highest level since September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will remain slightly above 6% next year.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Four-term North Carolina Democratic Gov. Jim Hunt, a towering figure in North Carolina politics in the late 20th century who helped leaders from both major parties strive for public education reform, died Thursday at the age of 88, his daughter Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt announced.",
      "Hunt, whose career provided a prototype for the modern \"education governor,\" served an unprecedented 16 years as governor as the state received the rewards and stings of shifting from textiles and tobacco to a high-tech economy.",
      "Rachel Hunt\u2019s office said that her father died peacefully Thursday at his Wilson County home.",
      "\u201cHe devoted his life to serving the people of North Carolina, guided by a belief that public service should expand opportunity, strengthen communities, and always put people first,\u201d Rachel Hunt said in a news release that also referenced \u201cmy beloved daddy and hero.\u201d",
      "Considered a business-oriented progressive, Hunt was a giant in state government and influential in the national education reform movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He was first elected governor in 1976 and, after a constitutional change, became the first North Carolina governor elected to successive four-year terms.",
      "Following an epic U.S. Senate campaign loss to Republican icon Jesse Helms in 1984, Hunt's political career resumed eight years later with a third term at the Executive Mansion, followed by reelection in 1996.",
      "Hunt remained active in Democratic politics after leaving office in 2001, particularly as he watched prot\u00e9g\u00e9s such as former Gov. Roy Cooper and the late U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan achieve higher office. He campaigned for President Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Cooper in 2016.",
      "\u201cI can think of no one who shaped North Carolina\u2019s recent successes as much as Governor Jim Hunt,\" current Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said Thursday. And Cooper called Hunt the \u201cgreatest Governor in North Carolina history.\u201d",
      "Even entering his 80s, Hunt urged Republicans in charge of the legislature to fund \u201cbig things\u201d for public education, rather than pass more income tax cuts.",
      "\u201cI'm proud of what we've done together,\u201d Hunt said in a May 2017 interview. \u201cBut I'm far from satisfied about where we are and determined to keep doing my little bit, I guess, to help us keep changing things and improving things in North Carolina. And I know you do it mainly through education.\u201d",
      "Hunt concentrated relentlessly on public schools, talking about the connection between education achievement and competing in the world economy. In the 1970s, while lieutenant governor, he worked with Republican Gov. Jim Holshouser to make North Carolina the first state with full-day kindergarten.",
      "In the 1980s, he helped create the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and pressed for standardized testing for public school students nationwide so that states could compare themselves.",
      "Returning as governor in the 1990s, he championed the Smart Start early childhood initiative, viewed as a national model to prepare children for school, and higher teacher pay. And after the end of his career in office, The Hunt Institute began training up and coming political stars nationwide about public education policy.",

Roy Barnes said in a 2009 interview. \u201cWe will feel the effect of Jim Hunt\u2019s leadership for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Hunt was an unabashed lobbyist for his programs and initiatives, often making late-night phone calls to lawmakers to persuade them. If that failed, he would enlist key constituents in a legislator\u2019s district to bombard with them calls all weekend.",
      "\u201cHe really had a way of pushing you to do things you never thought you could do,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Hunt staffer and later biographer. \u201cHe made you feel like that you were genuinely making the world a better place.\u201d",
      "James Baxter Hunt Jr. was born May 16, 1937, in Greensboro, North Carolina. He grew up on the family\u2019s tobacco and dairy farm in Wilson County. After law school graduation, Hunt, his wife, Carolyn, and their young children lived in Nepal for two years while working for the Ford Foundation.",
      "Hunt rose quickly in Democratic politics, serving as president of the state\u2019s Young Democrats in 1968 and getting elected lieutenant governor four years later.",
      "In a controversial move during his first term as governor, Hunt commuted the sentences of nine Black men and one white woman convicted of the 1971 firebombing of a Wilmington grocery store during days of violence that included the shooting of a Black teenager by police. Key witnesses in the case had recanted their testimony. Full pardons for the \u201cWilmington 10\u201d didn\u2019t come until 2012.",
      "His second four-year term closed with his political battle with Helms, the conservative firebrand known as \u201cSenator No\u201d for his opposition to civil rights, gay rights, abortion and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Hunt lost as Helms\u2019 campaign blistered him with ads portraying Hunt as a flip-flopper on the issues.",
      "A defeated Hunt returned to practicing law but remained in public life. His comeback to state politics in the early 1990s helped delay a growing Republican tide in North Carolina politics.",
      "Even GOP leaders begrudgingly were impressed with Hunt\u2019s ability to tack with changing political winds. In the mid-1990s, he called a special legislative session to get tough on crime and proposed tax cuts larger than what Republicans initially offered.",

      "Lawmakers across the U.S. will be debating whether to adopt new federal tax breaks for tips, overtime and business expenses",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- To tax tips or not? That is a question that will confront lawmakers in states across the U.S. as they convene for work next year.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is urging states to follow its lead by enacting a slew of new tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including deductions for tips and overtime wages, automobile loans and business equipment.",
      "In some states, the new federal tax breaks will automatically apply to state income taxes unless legislatures opt out. But in many other states, where tax laws are written differently, the new tax breaks won't appear on state tax forms unless legislatures opt in.",
      "In states that don't conform to the federal tax changes, workers who receive tips or overtime \u2014 for example \u2014 will pay no federal tax on those earnings but could still owe state taxes on them.",
      "States that embrace all of Trump's tax cuts could provide hundreds of millions of dollars of annual savings to certain residents and businesses. But that could financially strain states, which are being hit with higher costs because of new Medicaid and SNAP food aid requirements that also are included in the big bill Trump signed.",
      "Most states begin their annual legislative sessions in January. To retroactively change tax breaks for 2025, lawmakers would need to act quickly so tax forms could updated before people begin filing them. States also could apply the changes to their 2026 taxes, a decision requiring less haste.",
      "So far, only a few states have taken votes on whether to adopt the tax breaks.",
      "\u201cStates in general are approaching this skeptically,\" said Carl Davis, research director at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A bill Trump signed on July 4 contains about $4.5 trillion of federal tax cuts over 10 years.",
      "It creates temporary tax deductions for tips, overtime and loan interest on new vehicles assembled in the U.S. It boosts a tax deduction for older adults. And it temporarily raises cap on state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000, among other things. The law also provides numerous tax breaks to businesses, including the ability to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "Forty-one states levy individual income taxes on wages and salaries. Forty-four states charge corporate income taxes.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this month called on those states \u201cto immediately conform\u201d to the federal tax cuts and accused some Democratic-led states that haven't done so of engaging in \"political obstructionism.\u201d Though Bessent didn't mention it, many Republican-led states also have not decided whether to implement the tax deductions.",
      "\u201cBy denying their residents access to these important tax cuts, these governors and legislators are forcing hardworking Americans to shoulder higher state tax burdens, robbing them of the relief they deserve and exacerbating the financial squeeze on low- and middle-income households,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "But some tax analysts contend there's more for states to consider. The tax break on tips, for example, could apply to nearly 70 occupation fields under a proposed rule from the Internal Revenue Service. But that would still exclude numerous low-wage workers, said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the nonprofit Tax Foundation.",

      "\u201cLawmakers need to consider whether these are worth the cost,\u201d Walczak said.",
      "Because of the way state tax laws are written, the federal tax breaks for tips and overtime wages would have carried over to just seven states \u2014 Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon and South Carolina. But Colorado opted out of the state tax break for overtime shortly before the federal law was enacted.",
      "Michigan this fall became first \u2014 and, so far, only \u2014 state to opt into the tax breaks for tips and overtime wages, effective in 2026. The overtime tax exemption is projected to cost the state nearly $113 million and the tips tax break about $45 million during its current budget year, according to the state treasury department.",
      "Michigan lawmakers offset that by decoupling from five federal corporate tax changes the state's treasury estimated would have reduced Michigan tax revenues by $540 million this budget year.",
      "Republican state Rep. Ann Bollin, chair of the Michigan House Appropriations Committee, said the state could not afford to embrace all the tax cuts while still investing in better roads, public safety and education.",
      "\u201cThe best path forward is to have more money in people\u2019s pockets and have less regulation \u2014 and this kind of moved in that direction,\u201d she said.",
      "Arizona could be among the next states to act. Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has called upon lawmakers to adopt the tax breaks for tips, overtime, seniors and vehicle loans, and follow the federal government by also increasing the state's standard deduction for individual income taxpayers. Republican state House leaders said they stand ready to pass the tax cuts when their session begins Jan. 12.",
      "In addition to Michigan, lawmakers in Delaware, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have passed measures to block some or all of the corporate tax cuts from taking effect in their states.",
      "A new Illinois law decoupling from a portion of the corporate tax changes could save the state nearly $250 million, said Democratic state Sen. Elgie Sims, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He said that could help ensure continued funding for schools, health care and vital services.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, an outspoken Democratic opponent of Trump, also cited budget concerns for rejecting the corporate tax cut provision. He said states already stand to lose money because of other provisions in Trump's big bill, such as a requirement to cover more of the costs of running the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "\u201cThe decoupling is an effort to try to hold back the onslaught from the federal government to make sure that we can support programs like the one we\u2019re announcing today,\u201d Pritzker told reporters at a December event publicizing a grant to address homelessness in central Illinois.",

      "Carney also said trade irritants flagged this week by U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are elements of a \u201cmuch bigger discussion\u201d about continental trade. Greer said a coming review of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico trade deal will hinge on resolving U.S. concerns about Canadian policies on dairy products, alcohol and digital services.",

      "The 0.25 percentage point hike took the BOJ's benchmark short-term rate to 0.75%, its highest level since September 1995. It will raise costs for mortgages and other loans, but also boost yields on savings deposits.",
      "\u201cIt is highly likely that wages and prices will continue to rise moderately,\u201d BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda told reporters. \u201cRisks to the economy have diminished, but we must remain vigilant.\u201d",
      "Inflation has long remained above the BOJ's target of about 2%. It was 3% in November, excluding volatile fresh food costs.",
      "The 0.75% rate is still low by most standards, but the BOJ has kept that rate near or below zero for years, trying to pull the economy out of a deflationary funk. Since the pandemic, most other central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have raised rates to counter spiking inflation and then begun cutting them to help their slowing economies recover momentum.",
      "Japan\u2019s own economy contracted at a 2.3% annual rate in the last quarter, but improved business sentiment and price pressures have led the BOJ to relent and raise rates. Here are some things to know about its decision.",
      "Since Japan's economic bubble burst in the early 1990s, the central bank has kept borrowing costs low to encourage more spending by businesses and consumers.",
      "Lower interest rates have also helped the central bank manage the country's massive national debt, which amounts to nearly triple the size of the economy.",
      "As Japan\u2019s population has aged and begun declining, its economy has slowed and that led to deflation, or falling prices due to weak demand. Even with cheap credit, investment has lagged, stunting economic growth.",
      "In early 2013, the central bank launched what was dubbed a \u201cbig bazooka\u201d of monetary easing, cutting interest rates and purchasing government bonds and other securities to help channel more money into the economy.

      "The planned rate hike was reported by Japanese media ahead of time, giving investors a head start on adjusting their portfolios.",
      "Initially, the yen weakened after Friday's rate hike, as the dollar rose to 157 yen, nearly twice its level in 2012 and near its highest level this year.",
      "Still, even small changes in interest rates can have a big impact. Analysts have forecast that higher rates in Japan may undermine an investment strategy known as the \u201ccarry trade.\u201d That involves investors borrowing cheaply in yen and then using that money to invest in higher paying assets elsewhere.",
      "Carry trades are lucrative when stocks and other investments are climbing, but losses can snowball if many traders face pressure to sell stocks or other assets all at once.",
      "Higher rates in Japan may also crimp demand for other assets, including cryptocurrencies. Last week, expectations about the rate hike caused the price of bitcoin, for example, to drop below $86,000. It had bolted to record highs near $125,000 in early October. Bitcoin was trading at about $88,000 early Friday.",

      "The head of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has urged white men to report workplace discrimination based on race or sex",
      "The head of the U.S. agency for enforcing workplace civil rights posted a social media call-out urging white men to come forward if they have experienced race or sex discrimination at work.",
      "\u201cAre you a white male who has experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex? You may have a claim to recover money under federal civil rights laws,\" U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Andrea Lucas, a vocal critic of DEI, wrote on X Wednesday evening. The post urged eligible workers to reach out to the agency \u201cas soon as possible\" and referred users to the agency's fact sheet on \u201cDEI-related discrimination\u201d for more information.",
      "Lucas' post, viewed millions of times, was shared about two hours after Vice President JD Vance posted an article he said \u201cdescribes the evil of DEI and its consequences,\" which also received millions of views. Lucas responded to Vance's post saying: \u201cAbsolutely right @JDVance. And precisely because this widespread, systemic, unlawful discrimination primarily harmed white men, elites didn\u2019t just turn a blind eye; they celebrated it. Absolutely unacceptable; unlawful; immoral.\u201d",
      "She added that the EEOC \u201cwon\u2019t rest until this discrimination is eliminated.\u201d Neither the agency nor Vance responded immediately to requests for additional comment.",
      "Since being named acting chair of the EEOC in January, Lucas has been shifting the agency's focus to prioritize \u201crooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination,\u201d aligning with President Donald Trump's own anti-DEI executive orders. Trump named Lucas as the agency's chair in November.",
      "Earlier this year, the EEOC along with the Department of Justice issued two \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d documents attempting to clarify what might constitute \u201cDEI-related Discrimination at Work\u201d and providing guidance on how workers can file complaints over such concerns. The documents took broad aim at practices such as training, employee resource groups and fellowship programs, warning such programs \u2014 depending on how they\u2019re constructed \u2014 could run afoul of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race and gender.",
      "Those documents have been criticized by former agency commissioners as misleading for portraying DEI initiatives as legally fraught.",
      "David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at the NYU School of Law, said Lucas's latest social media posts demonstrate a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of what DEI is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really much more about creating a culture in which you get the most out of everyone who you\u2019re bringing on board, where everyone experiences fairness and equal opportunity, including white men and members of other groups,\u201d Glasgow said.",
      "The Meltzer Center tracks lawsuits that are likely to affect workplace DEI practices, including 57 cases of workplace discrimination. Although there are instances in which it occurs on a case-by-case basis, Glasgow said he has not seen \u201cany kind of systematic evidence that white men are being discriminated against.\u201d",
      "He pointed out that Fortune 500 CEOs are overwhelmingly white men, and that relative to their share of the population, the demographic is overrepresented in corporate senior leadership, Congress, and beyond.",

      "\u201cIf DEI has been this engine of discrimination against white men, I have to say it hasn\u2019t really been doing a very good job at achieving that,\u201d Glasgow said.",
      "Jenny Yang, a former EEOC chair and now a partner at law firm Outten & Golden, said it is \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cproblematic\u201d for the head of the agency to single out a particular demographic group for civil rights enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt suggests some sort of priority treatment,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that sounds to me like equal opportunity for all.\u201d",
      "On the other hand, the agency has done the opposite for transgender workers, whose discrimination complaints have been deprioritized or dropped completely, Yang said. The EEOC has limited resources, and must accordingly prioritize which cases to pursue. But treating charges differently based on workers' identities goes against the mission of the agency, she said.",
      "\u201cIt worries me that a message is being sent that the EEOC only cares about some workers and not others,\" Yang said.",

      "GLOUCESTER, England -- Waiting in the wings on opening night of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d Michael Edwards felt the nerve-wracking jitters he experienced four decades earlier staring through thick glasses down a perilously steep ski jump.",
      "The athlete-turned-performer better known as \u201cEddie the Eagle\u201d was no stranger to fear, but this was different: he was about to face a theater packed with children.",
      "In ski jumping, he might break his neck; here he only risked tripping over his lines and failing to win laughs.",
      "Edwards has added acting to the bustling business of being Eddie the Eagle, feathering his nest and stretching his celebrity far longer than his brief flight as Britain\u2019s first Olympic ski jumper won him fame despite finishing last in the 1988 Calgary Games.",
      "There is almost nothing he hasn't done since he entered the spotlight. He has recorded songs, danced on ice, dressed twice as a chicken (eagle suits are scarce), been interviewed in an Amsterdam brothel, filmed car and spectacle commercials, and spoken for hours at a time about what he knows best: how he landed here.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always very, very grateful that I got christened Eddie The Eagle and it\u2019s amazing that I\u2019m talking about it 38 years later,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that I encourage other people to get out there, get off their bum and go for their dream.\u201d",
      "It didn't appear early on that Edwards was headed for fame.",
      "He grew up \u2014 and still lives \u2014 on the edge of the Cotswolds, in western England where snow is rare and the hills would never be mistaken for mountains. His father expected his son to follow him into plastering \u2014 as he did after his father and grandfather.",
      "But an adolescent Edwards had different designs after a school trip to the Italian Alps sparked a passion for skiing. He became a fixture at Gloucester Ski Centre, where a bristly plastic surface shorter than three football fields offers year-round skiing.",
      "He became a good downhiller, but didn't make the British ski team for the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics. Undeterred, he set his sights higher after realizing Britain had no ski jumpers.",
      "Edwards went to Lake Placid, New York, where he rummaged for skis and gear, including a helmet with no strap that he secured with string and oversized boots he padded out with five pairs of socks.",
      "At 22, he was learning what the world\u2019s best jumpers began mastering as children.",
      "\u201cIt was like a crash course. And, yeah, I did take huge risks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I finished ski jumping, I was just as scared to do my last jump as I was to do my first. You never get used to it.\u201d",
      "Short on cash and lacking sponsors, he scrounged food from trash bins, slept in barns, a car and even a mental hospital in Finland \u2014 not to mention medical hospitals.",
      "\"It would be easier to name the bones I haven\u2019t broken,\" he quipped.",
      "He fractured his skull twice \u2014 while wearing a helmet \u2014 broke his jaw, smashed his collarbone in five places, broke three ribs and damaged a kidney and a knee. It didn't stop him.",
      "He worked up to bigger jumps and competed internationally. Despite efforts by British sports federations to prevent him competing, he eventually jumped far enough to represent Great Britain at the Olympics.",
      "Edwards arrived in Calgary to a sign welcoming \u201cEddie the Eagle\u201d \u2014 unaware it was for him.",
      "Reporters loved his enthusiastic underdog determination and physical appearance. He was hefty by ski jumping standards, had a lantern jaw, wispy moustache and eyes that bulged behind thick lenses in his pink-rimmed aviator-style glasses.",
      "Few outside the ski jumping world remember the winner, \u201cFlying Finn\u201d Matti Nyk\u00e4nen, who soared over 120 meters and swept all events.",
      "The most famous remains the man who finished last \u2014 19 meters behind his nearest competitor, but setting a new British record of 71 meters (77 yards).",

      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways",
      "Every animal with a brain needs sleep \u2014 and even a few without a brain do, too. Humans sleep, birds sleep, whales sleep and even jellyfish sleep.",
      "Sleep is universal \u201ceven though it\u2019s actually very risky,\u201d said Paul-Antoine Libourel, a researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon in France.",
      "When animals nod off, they're most vulnerable to sneaky predators. But despite the risks, the need for sleep is so strong that no creature can skip it altogether, even when it's highly inconvenient.",
      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways \u2014 for example, stealing seconds at a time during around-the-clock parenting, getting winks on the wing during long migrations and even dozing while swimming.",
      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that sleep is really flexible in response to ecological demands,\u201d said Niels Rattenborg, an animal sleep research specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Germany.",
      "Call it the emerging science of \u201cextreme sleep.\u201d",

      "These penguins mate for life and share parenting duties \u2014 with one bird babysitting the egg or tiny gray fluffy chick to keep it warm and safe while the other swims off to fish for a family meal. Then they switch roles \u2014 keeping up this nonstop labor for weeks.",
      "Penguin parents face a common challenge: getting enough sleep while keeping a close eye on their newborns.",
      "They survive by taking thousands of catnaps a day \u2014 each averaging just 4 seconds long.",
      "These short \u201cmicrosleeps,\" as Korea Polar Research Institute biologist Won Young Lee calls them, appear to be enough to allow penguin parents to carry out their caregiving duties for weeks within their crowded, noisy colonies.",
      "When a clumsy neighbor passes by or predatory seabirds are near, the penguin parent blinks to alert attention and soon dozes off again, its chin nodding against its chest, like a drowsy driver.",
      "The naps add up. Each penguin sleeps for a total of 11 hours per day, as scientists found by measuring the brain activity of 14 adults over 11 days on Antarctica's King George Island.",
      "To remain mostly alert, yet also sneak in sufficient winks, the penguins have evolved an enviable ability to function on extremely fractured sleep \u2014 at least during the breeding season.",
      "Researchers can now see when either hemisphere of the brain \u2014 or both at once \u2014 are asleep.",

      "In some cases, the answer is yes \u2014 as scientists discovered when they attached devices that measure brain-wave activity to the heads of large seabirds nesting in the Galapagos Islands called great frigatebirds.",
      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",
      "On land, life is easy for a 5,000-pound (2,268-kilogram) northern elephant seal. But at sea, sleep is dangerous \u2014 sharks and killer whales that prey on seals are lurking.",

      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "NEW YORK -- The last major meteor shower of the year, known as the Ursids, peaks soon, bringing glowing streaks to nighttime and early morning skies. Compared to other meteor showers, it's more subdued, but experts say it's still worth a glimpse.",
      "Meteor showers happen when space rocks hit Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, gaining fiery tails \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d Random meteors are visible from Earth on any given clear night, but more predictable meteor showers happen yearly when Earth passes through streams of cosmic leftovers from comets or asteroids.",
      "The Ursids peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will be visible until Dec. 26 from the Northern Hemisphere. Skygazers usually see five to 10 meteors per hour during the height and there's a possibility for outbursts of up to 25 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "How active a shower will appear from Earth depends on the amount of debris and the moon's brightness, which can blot out glowing meteors. The Ursids feature less space debris than other showers like the Geminids, but the narrow crescent moon won't be much of an obstacle when they peak.",
      "No special equipment is needed to view a meteor shower. To see the Ursids, which hail from a comet called 8P/Tuttle, bundle up and get away from city lights.",

      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",

One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "Corals also are home to more than 25% of marine life, making them crucial for the millions of people around the world who make a living from fishing.",

      "It's not yet dawn in Bayahibe when he climbs into a boat to fish with his father, who at 65 still goes to sea every week. The engine roars as they travel mile after mile until the coastline fades into the horizon. To catch tuna, dorado, or marlin, Luis B\u00e1ez sails up to 50 miles offshore.",

      "Del Rosario said there's still time to halt the decline of the reefs.",
      "\u201cMore needs to be done, of course ... but we are investing a lot of effort and time to preserve what we love so much,\" he said. \"And we trust and believe that many people around the world are doing the same.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers funded by the Department of Energy to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications, according to a congressional report published Wednesday.",
      "The authors of the report say the U.S. must do more to protect high-tech research and ensure that the results of taxpayer-funded work don't end up benefiting Beijing. They recommended several changes to better protect scientific research in the U.S., including new policies for the Department of Energy to use when deciding whether to fund work that involves Chinese partnerships.",
      "The investigation is part of a congressional push to raise a firewall blocking U.S. research from boosting China's military buildup when the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry that will shape the future global order.",
      "Investigators from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce identified more than 4,300 academic papers published between June 2023 and June of this year that involved collaborations between DOE-funded scientists and Chinese researchers. About half of the papers involved Chinese researchers affiliated with China's military or industrial base.",
      "Particularly concerning, investigators found that federal funds went to research collaborations with Chinese state-owned laboratories and universities that work directly for China\u2019s military, including some listed in a Pentagon database of Chinese military companies with operations in the U.S. The report also detailed collaborations between U.S. researchers and groups blamed for cyberattacks as well as human rights abuses in China.",
      "The Energy Department routinely funds advanced research into nuclear energy and the development and disposal of nuclear weaponry, along with a long list of other high-tech fields like quantum computing, materials science and physics. It doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research. The department oversees 17 national laboratories that have led the development in many technologies.",
      "The report followed a number of congressional investigations into federally funded research involving Chinese scientists and researchers. Last year, a report released by Republicans found that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade had allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology that could help strengthen its military. Another investigation this year revealed that the Pentagon in a recent two-year period funded hundreds of projects in collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense industry.",
      "The Energy Department has failed for decades to take steps to ensure the research it funds doesn't benefit China, the report's authors found. They made several recommendations to tighten the rules, including a new standardized approach to assessing the national security risks of research, as well as requirements that the department share information about research ties with China with other U.S. government agencies to make it easier to spot problems.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.",
      "\u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,\" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world\u2019s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.",

      "Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.",
      "Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",
      "The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.",
      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

      "Blanche, in his Fox appearance, said, \"The most important thing that the attorney general has talked about, that [FBI] Director [Kash] Patel has talked about, is that we protect victims, and so what we're doing is we are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce, making sure that every victim, their name, their identity, their story, to the extent it needs to be protected, is completely protected.\"",

      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",

      "The conservancy has not lost a rhino to poachers since 2017.

The Florida Supreme Court later reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial, and Walls was again convicted and sentenced to death in 1992.",
      "It would be Florida's 19th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending a state record for total executions in a single year.",
      "According to court records, Walls broke into the Florida Panhandle mobile home of Eglin Air Force Base airman Edward Alger and his girlfriend, Ann Peterson, in July 1987. Walls tied the couple up, but Alger managed to break free and attack Walls. Walls cut Alger\u2019s throat and them shot him in the head when the airman continued to fight. Walls then went to attack Peterson and shot her as she struggled.",
      "Walls was arrested the day after the bodies were found when his roommate tipped off police about Walls\u2019 odd behavior. During a search of the home, investigators reported finding items from the crime scene, and Walls later admitted to the killings.",
      "After his conviction, DNA evidence linked Walls to the May 1987 rape and murder of a woman, Audrey Gygi. Walls pleaded no contest, avoiding another trial and possible death sentence. Walls also admitted responsibility for the killings of Tommie Lou Whiddon in March 1985 and Cynthia Sue Condra in September 1986 as part of a deal with prosecutors.",
      "Attorneys for Walls filed appeals in state court claiming that his intellectual disability and other medical issues should disqualify him from execution, but the Florida Supreme Court ruled against Walls last week. Appeals were still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "Cervera, for her part, testified that she was uncomfortable backing up Dugan during her confrontations with the arrest team. She said she was shocked when she heard Dugan led Flores-Ruiz out a private door, adding that judges shouldn't help defendants evade arrest.

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Defenders of a Wisconsin judge found guilty of felony obstruction for helping a Mexican immigrant evade federal officers raised alarms Friday about judicial independence and said they hope the conviction will be overturned on appeal.",
      "A jury found Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan guilty on Thursday night after a four-day trial and six hours of deliberation. The jury found her not guilty of a misdemeanor concealment charge. No sentencing date had been set as of Friday morning. She could be sentenced to a maximum five years in prison.",
      "The verdict was a victory for President Donald Trump, whose administration filed the charges against Dugan and touted her arrest earlier this year, posting photos of her being led away in handcuffs.",
      "U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche praised the verdict on X, saying nobody is above the law, even judges.",
      "The case inflamed tensions over Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, with his administration branding Dugan an activist judge and Democrats countering that the administration is trying to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to the operation.",
      "U.S. Attorney Brad Schimel, a former Republican Wisconsin attorney general and judge, denied the case was political and urged people to accept the verdict peacefully.",
      "\u201cSome have sought to make this about a larger political battle,\u201d Schimel said. \u201cWhile this case is serious for all involved, it is ultimately about a single day, a single bad day, in a public courthouse. The defendant is certainly not evil. Nor is she a martyr for some greater cause.\u201d",
      "Dugan's defense attorney told the jury in closing arguments that the \u201ctop levels of government\u201d were involved in bringing charges against Dugan. But prosecutors argued Dugan put her personal beliefs above the law.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with immigration enforcement policy to see this was wrong,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelly Brown Watzka told the jury in closing arguments. \u201cYou just have to agree the law applies equally to everyone.\u201d",

      "Dugan's attorneys were expected to appeal the verdict.",
      "A coalition of 13 advocacy groups, including Common Cause Wisconsin and the League of Women Voters Wisconsin, said \u201chigher courts must carefully review the serious constitutional questions this case raises about due process, judicial authority, and federal overreach.\u201d",
      "Dugan was suspended as a judge after she was charged and the Wisconsin Constitution bars convicted felons from holding office. The Wisconsin Judicial Commission, which oversees disciplining of judges in the state, did not respond to a request Friday for information about what happens next in Dugan\u2019s case.",
      "On April 18, immigration officers went to the Milwaukee County courthouse after learning 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz had reentered the country illegally and was scheduled to appear before Dugan for a hearing in a state battery case.",
      "Dugan confronted agents outside her courtroom and after they had left led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out a private jury door. Agents spotted Flores-Ruiz in the corridor, followed him outside and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November he had been deported.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China\u2019s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",
      "\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a \u2014 you know \u2014 enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.",
      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",
      "Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.",
      "Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.",
      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\u201d",

      "The repatriation effort, which began in 2011, culminated earlier this month when the sacred rock was airlifted to its original location after being freed from a concrete slab in front of a church meetinghouse in the community of Tremonton, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) north of Salt Lake City.",
      "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Wednesday that historians and conservators working on its behalf partnered with the tribe and the state to carefully remove and clean the 2,500-pound (1,134-kilogram) rock. The process involved saws, chisels and eventually soap and water to remove years of lichen growth from the petroglyphs.",
      "For Brad Parry, the tribe\u2019s vice chair, it was emotional seeing the rock returned to the rugged hillside to rejoin other petroglyph-covered rocks. He said it's a spiritual place where Shoshone ancestors would gather to camp and hunt.",

For decades, it sat outside the building, first near the flagpole and then on the north side. Grainy black and white photos shared by the church showed the rock on display.",

      "Even as prosecutors prepare to retry the accused man, Pedro Hernandez, they are hoping the Supreme Court will short-circuit that process by reinstating his 2017 conviction. A federal appeals court overturned the verdict this summer, faulting how a New York trial judge had answered a question from jurors.",
      "\u201cThat invalidation of a state jury verdict on such a slender reed flouted\u201d a law that limits when federal courts can invalidate a state-court conviction, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and some high-ranking deputies wrote in the filing.",

      "A message seeking comment was sent to Hernandez's lawyers.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors and Hernandez's attorneys are due in court Friday to discuss scheduling and steps leading toward a retrial. A different judge is presiding, as the case's former judge is no longer on the bench.",

      "Hernandez already has been tried twice. A jury deadlocked in 2015, and then a different panel of jurors convicted him at a 2017 retrial.",
      "During deliberations, the 2017 jurors asked a complicated question: If they decided Hernandez didn't confess voluntarily when he hadn't been read his rights yet, must they disregard his other confessions? The then-judge responded simply, \u201cthe answer is no.\u201d The jury went on to convict.",
      "In overturning that verdict, the appeals court said the jury's question should have gotten a more fulsome answer, including the possibility of discounting all the confessions.",

The Army initially said all five victims were soldiers.",
      "A week after the shootings, Army prosecutors charged Radford with six counts of attempted murder and assault, with the sixth victim being a person the shooter fired at and missed.

      "LOS ANGELES -- Two Los Angeles-area 15-year-old gang members pleaded guilty Thursday to murder and attempted murder charges, admitting they were acting as hired hitmen for Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, officials said.",
      "During two attempts to kill the cartel's target, they wounded two people and killed one, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Each gang member expected to be paid approximately $50,000, prosecutors said.",
      "According to their plea agreements, the two teenagers are members of the Mexican Mafia-affiliated Westside Wilmas gang from the greater Los Angeles area.",
      "On March 27, 2024, they drove from their homes in Wilmington to find their target at a Chili's restaurant in Chula Vista, a suburb of San Diego. When the target was leaving the restaurant with his family, they shot at him in the parking lot and struck his legs, prosecutors said. They also attempted unsuccessfully to hit him with their car when their firearm jammed and they fled the scene.",
      "Later that night, the two teenagers showed up at the intended victim\u2019s home joined by an older accomplice. After the two shot indiscriminately at the people in the apartment, hitting one of them in the hand, arm and face, one of the people shot and killed the teenagers' accomplice in self-defense, prosecutors said.",

      "A Northern California school district near the state's border with Nevada is caught up in a dispute over the states' differing policies on the participation of transgender athletes",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A Lake Tahoe school district is caught between California and Nevada's competing policies on transgender student athletes, a dispute that's poised to reorder where the district's students compete.",
      "High schools in California's Tahoe-Truckee Unified School District, set in a mountainous, snow-prone area near the border with Nevada, have for decades competed in the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association, or NIAA. That has allowed sports teams to avoid making frequent and potentially hazardous trips in poor winter weather to competitions farther to the west, district officials say.",
      "But the Nevada association voted in April to require students in sex-segregated sports programs to play on teams that align with their sex assigned at birth \u2014 a departure from a previous approach allowing individual schools to set their own standards. The move raised questions for how the Tahoe-Truckee district would remain in the Nevada association while following California law, which says students can play on teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "Now, California's Department of Education is requiring the district to join the California Interscholastic Federation, or CIF, by the start of next school year.",
      "District Superintendent Kerstin Kramer said at a school board meeting this week the demand puts the district in a difficult position.",
      "\u201cNo matter which authority we\u2019re complying with we are leaving students behind,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we have been stuck.\u201d",
      "There are currently no known transgender student athletes competing in high school sports in Tahoe-Truckee Unified, district officials told the education department in a letter. But a former student filed a complaint with the state in June after the board decided to stick with Nevada athletics, Kramer said.",
      "The dispute comes amid a nationwide battle over the rights of transgender youth in which states have restricted transgender girls from participating on girls sports teams, barred gender-affirming surgeries for minors and required parents to be notified if a child changes their pronouns at school. At least 24 states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions. Some of the policies have been blocked in court.",
      "Meanwhile, California is fighting the Trump administration in court over transgender athlete policies. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February aimed at banning transgender women and girls from participating in female athletics. The U.S. Justice Department also sued the California Department of Education in July, alleging its policy allowing transgender girls to compete on girls sports teams violates federal law.",
      "And Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has signedlaws aimed at protecting trans youth, shocked party allies in March when he raised questions on his podcast about the fairness of trans women and girls competing against other female athletes. His office did not comment on the Tahoe-Truckee Unified case, but said Newsom \u201crejects the right wing\u2019s cynical attempt to weaponize this debate as an excuse to vilify individual kids.\u201d",
      "The state education department said in a statement that all California districts must follow the law regardless of which state's athletic association they join.",

      "But Beth Curtis, a civil rights attorney whose children attended schools in Tahoe-Truckee Unified, said the district should fight NIAA from implementing its trans student athlete policy as violating the Nevada Constitution.",
      "The district has drafted a plan to transition to the California federation by the 2028-2029 school year after state officials ordered it to take action. It's awaiting the education department's response.",
      "Curtis doesn't think the state will allow the district to delay joining CIF, the California federation, another two years, noting the education department is vigorously defending its law against the Trump administration: \"They\u2019re not going to fight to uphold the law and say to you at the same time, \u2018Okay, you can ignore it for two years.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tahoe-Truckee Unified's two high schools with athletic programs, which are located about 6,000 feet (1,800 meters) in elevation, compete against both California and Nevada teams in nearby mountain towns \u2014 and others more distant and closer to sea level. If the district moves to the California federation, Tahoe-Truckee Unified teams may have to travel more often in bad weather across a risky mountain pass \u2014 about 7,000 feet (2,100 meters) in elevation above a lake \u2014 to reach schools farther from state lines.",
      "Coleville High School, a small California school in the Eastern Sierra near the Nevada border, has also long been a member of the Nevada association, said Heidi Torix, superintendent of the Eastern Sierra Unified School District. The school abides by California law regarding transgender athletes, Torix said.",
      "The school has not been similarly ordered by California to switch where it competes. The California Department of Education did not respond to requests for comment on whether it's warned any other districts not in the California federation about possible noncompliance with state policy.",
      "State Assemblymember Heather Hadwick, a Republican representing a large region of northern California bordering Nevada, said Tahoe-Truckee Unified shouldn't be forced to join the CIF.",
      "\u201cI urge California Department of Education and state officials to fully consider the real-world consequences of this decision\u2014not in theory, but on the ground\u2014where weather, geography, and safety matter,\u201d Hadwick said.",

    "summary": "Jelly Roll had said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without requiring burdensome paperwork.",
    "story": [
      "Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer, whose legal name is Jason Deford, has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued his pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without requiring burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters, adding he hopes to meet Jelly Roll for the first time soon.",
      "Beginning at the age of 14, Jelly Roll was in and out of jail for about a decade for convictions including aggravated robbery, shoplifting, drug possession and drug dealing.",
      "In January 2024, \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interviewed Jelly Roll inside the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in Nashville, where he had once been an inmate. At the time, Jelly Roll had just been nominated for two Grammys.",
      "\"There was a time in my life where I truly thought \u2026 this was it,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"And then coming here, you know, just after getting nominated for two Grammys, it just hits different\u2026I didn't think I'd get emotional, to be honest.",
      "He told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" he wrote hundreds of songs while in jail.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a pardon in Tennessee serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence and been released. Pardons offer a path to get certain civil rights restored, such as the right to vote, although there are some limitations under state law, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations, three of them recently.",
      "Much of his work has become associated with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" that tells the story of someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "In making his case to the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, stating it began as a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Beyond his sold-out shows, he's brought his story to the Senate, where he testified in January 2024 about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Friends and civic leaders backed the pardon application, citing Jelly Roll's transformation.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represents Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

      "Gloria Gaynor's\u00a0\"I Will Survive\" has been a motivational anthem for nearly five\u00a0decades \u2013 but it didn't just serve as inspiration for millions of fans. Gaynor told \"CBS Mornings\" the song gave her hope during one of the most difficult periods of her life.",
      "After a fall on stage in 1978 at New York's Beacon Theatre, Gaynor suffered a serious spinal injury and spent months in recovery. Many thought her career was over, but during that painful healing, she recorded what would become a smash hit, \"I Will Survive.\"",
      "\"I was living that song\"",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording in 1980 \u2013 the only time that category existed. In 2016, it was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry for its cultural significance. Now, Gaynor is a 2025 Kennedy Center honoree for her lifetime artistic achievements.",
      "The track was supposed to be a B-side, but Gaynor immediately knew it was a winner. When she was recording it, standing in a back brace, she felt a deep connection to the music",
      "\"[I was] hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I survived the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior. Yeah, I was living that song and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one,\" she said.",
      "The song became her anthem \u2013 and the world's \u2013 with over 200 covers in more than 20 different languages. And, of course, it sparked several trends on social media.",
      "Just a girl from Jersey",
      "Before becoming the \"queen of disco,\" Gaynor was just a girl from Newark, New Jersey. Her talent went unnoticed until a neighbor heard her sing and she was called up to the stage at a club one night to perform.",
      "She eventually worked the nightclub circuit. Her big break came from a meeting with legendary record executive Clive Davis, who helped propel her to the center of disco. Her 1975 debut album, \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" was one of the first disco albums to top the charts, cracking the top 25 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Early in her career, Gaynor said she was singing R&B but decided she really wanted to give people music to dance to.",
      "\"I remember that discotheques were very, very new. There were just a couple and what they were was cabaret clubs where they'd just taken away the chairs,\" she recalled.",
      "Her profile continued to grow as she toured the world. As disco faded in the 1980s, Gaynor kept performing around the world. Years later, she found a new purpose through faith and gospel music. Her 2019 album, \"Testimony,\" earned her a Grammy, proving her voice still inspires.",
      "Lessons for new artists",
      "Now, nearly 50 years after her rise to fame, Gaynor is honored with one of the nation's highest distinctions: the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "\"I got a phone call from my manager and I was ecstatic,\" said Gaynor as she learned about the award. \"It was incredible to even think about being accepted as one who deserved that.\"",
      "Gaynor is now parting her wisdom to new artists. Her top takeaway: Don't set out to seek rewards.",
      "\" I would say to them, be about doing the best you can with what God gave you,\" she said. \"All of that stuff is extra.\u00a0 I didn't strive to get a Grammy. I strive to do the best song I could do at that time.\u00a0 I strive to touch people's hearts. I strive to uplift, encourage, and power people And so, be about that.\"",

      "Nick Reiner\u00a0appeared in a Los Angeles court on Wednesday over the killing of his parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner. After brief proceedings, his arraignment was postponed until Jan. 7, defense attorney Alan Jackson told reporters.",
      "The judge instructed cameras not to film Reiner, CBS News' Adam Yamaguchi reported.",
      "Reiner was behind a glass wall in a custody area, and he did not enter a plea. He only said, \"yes, your honor,\" to agree to the arraignment date. His lawyer had requested the postponement.",
      "He wore a suicide prevention smock as he appeared in shackles, The Associated Press reported.",
      "After the court appearance, Jackson told reporters the case needed to be treated with \"restraint and with dignity.\"",
      "\"This is a devastating tragedy that has befallen the Reiner family,\" he said. \"There are very, very complex and serious issues that are associated with this case. These need to be thoroughly but very carefully dealt with and examined and looked at and analyzed.\"",
      "Jake and Romy Reiner, Rob and Michele's other two children, released a statement Wednesday saying they were \"grateful for the outpouring of condolences, kindness, and support.\"",

The horrific and devastating loss of our parents, Rob and Michele Reiner, is something that no one should ever experience. They weren't just our parents; they were our best friends,\" they said in the statement.",

      "Nick Reiner, 32, is being charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced on Tuesday.

      "The day before, they had gone to a party at Conan O'Brien's, where Rob and Nick Reiner had a brief but loud argument, sources who were there told CBS News. Nick Reiner checked into a hotel in Santa Monica about four miles away early Sunday morning, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Police have not released details about evidence in the case, or any information about a possible motive or what led them to arrest Nick Reiner.",

    "story": [
      "Before he was two-time world heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Balboa, he was just little Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone with the unusually deep voice.",
      "His voice and slurred speech were the result of an injury during childbirth that also caused facial drooping \u2014 a condition for which he was relentlessly bullied. And life at home wasn't much easier. When his parents divorced in 1957, when he was 11, he moved in with his father, who he says was emotionally and physically abusive.",
      "\"It's hard to navigate because you're going to catch it, especially when you're a bit rebellious like me. You're going to get a beating. After a while, you learn to just expect it,\" Stallone told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King during an interview inside his Florida home.",
      "He found solace in the silver screen.",
      "\"I worshipped escapism,\" explained Stallone, especially mythical heroes like Hercules.",
      "Stallone's \"Rocky\" road to success",
      "In his early 20s, he moved to New York City to pursue his dreams, teaching himself to write after struggling as a young actor. In 1975, he wrote a film that would change everything: \"Rocky.\"",
      "At the time, the studio didn't want Stallone to star in his own film, but he insisted. It was a gamble that paid off \u2014 \"Rocky\" went on to win three Academy Awards, including best picture. What should have been one of the happiest nights of his life was also one of the saddest.",
      "\"I mean, it's a volcanic moment, and then it was very sad,\" said Stallone, choking up.",
      "Stallone's parents didn't attend the Oscars as his guests when he was nominated for the award in 1977.",
      "\"You want people that you love that denied you, now you're here, you're at the Oscars, and they don't want to go,\" he continued. \"You realize that, at that moment, that you're never ever going to come to terms with this. And it's like, what more do you need? Really, what f\u2014ing more do you need to do to say, 'I'm here.'\"",
      "For Stallone, it was a valuable lesson.",
      "\"Parents should really wise up. Kids are the same as soft clay. They really are. You mold them, and you dent them, and you hurt them, or you drop them off the table, and they're not the same shape anymore,\" he said. \"I still walk around with it. And I wish I couldn't. And I pray, and I do everything, but it's always there.\"",
      "Stallone, who was recently named a 2025 Kennedy Center honoree, hopes his story can help inspire others to pursue their dreams against all odds.",
      "He told King about his hopes for his legacy: \"I really want to be a symbol for how an average person, really an average person, can overcome overwhelming odds.\"",
      "Stallone clarifies his cinematic origin story",
      "Though \"Rocky\" is frequently described as a sports drama, Stallone disagrees \u2014 and wants to set the record straight.",
      "\"The toughest thing about Rocky, and even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie. It's not. It's a love story,\" he said. \"It starts with love.\"",
      "According to Stallone, the real triumph of \"Rocky\" is the evolving love between Rocky and Adrian, portrayed by Talia Shire. The film, he said, \"will rise and fall on love, not fights.\"",
      "From commercial highs to comeback hits",
      "Following the success of \"Rocky,\" Stallone co-wrote and starred in another blockbuster, \"Rambo.\" He played John Rambo, who he refers to as his alter ego.",
      "\"He's my father,\" he explained. \"100%. That's all I had to do was clone him, but the difference is Rambo is sad. Rambo is a disenfranchised child, he was a child of America. And America asked him to do a chore, he did the chore, and he was \u2013 it rejected him.\"",
      "After two hit franchises early in his career, he endured a series of box office flops.",
      "\"It was more than a drought. It was about eight years of spiderwebs on the phone,\" he recalled, admitting he was \"crumbling\" at the time.",
      "Everything changed when Rocky Balboa made a comeback in 2006. And then the work kept on coming. He's currently filming Season 4 of his hit Paramount+ show \"Tulsa King.\"",

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

      "Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X.

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 18:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Anthony Geary, who played Luke Spencer on the long-running soap opera \"General Hospital,\" has died.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "Netflix leaders doubled down Monday on their intention to acquire part of Warner Bros. Discovery, while also looking to alleviate concerns in Hollywood about the blockbuster deal's potential impact on the movie business.",
      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery for roughly $108 billion. Unlike Netflix, Paramount is also offering to buy Warner's cable brands, which include CNN, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS and TNT.",

    "summary": "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits over allegations of poor care.",
    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

      "DraftKings is entering the red-hot prediction markets business, launching technology that lets users trade contracts linked to sporting and financial events.",
      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",
      "DraftKings said its app, which is expected to be available in major app stores within days, will connect with multiple exchanges, starting with the derivatives marketplace CME Group.",
      "Once they have a DraftKings account, users can enter the DraftKings Predictions app and start trading by clicking on the yes/no questions associated with an event, such as an NFL game, and deciding how much money they want to wager.",
      "More specifically, users originate the trades, while DraftKings acts as a broker, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, the general manager of DraftKings Predictions, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're handling that order and it's getting sent to an exchange for it to be executed,\" she explained.",
      "DraftKings faces growing competition from prediction markets \u2014 including Kalshi and Polymarket, now valued at $9 billion and $11 billion, respectively \u2014 that enable users to speculate on the outcome of sports and other events.",
      "In October, DraftKings\u00a0announced\u00a0the acquisition of Railbird Technologies, a federally regulated prediction market. At the time, DraftKings said the deal supports its \"broader strategy to enter prediction markets.\"",
      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",
      "\"We certify markets all the time that we do not end up listing,\" Kalshi said on X\u00a0on Dec. 18. \"We have no immediate plans to list these contracts.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "summary": "Instacart's \"unlawful tactics\" hurt shoppers and raised the cost of groceries, according to the FTC.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that 10 of its retail partners are testing that approach to pricing, describing such practices as a standard way stores assess customer preferences.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced that U.S. service members will receive a $1,776 bonus, which he called a \"warrior dividend,\" before Christmas.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the plan in a White House address billed as focusing on affordability, said the amount was inspired by the year of the nation's founding.",
      "The money is \"to both thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the U.S. military has been defending the nation,\" the White House said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about the dividend.",
      "Is it a recurring bonus?",
      "The \"warrior dividend\" is a one-time pay bump for the nation's 1.45 million\u00a0military service members, according to the White House.",
      "\"1776; as you know, our great nation was founded in the crucible of revolution in that year,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media video posted Thursday.",
      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",
      "Active duty service members who fell under the pay grades of O-6 or below as of Nov. 30 are eligible for the checks. Reserve component service members on active duty orders of 31 days as of that same date also qualify for the payments, according to the White House.",
      "In the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force, that includes people with the officer rank of colonel or below. For the Navy and Coast Guard, it includes those with the rank of captain or below.",
      "Active duty officers with an O-6 pay grade and two years of experience or less earn $8,340.90 a month, according to 2025 military pay charts. O-1 officers with the same amount of experience earn $3,998.40 monthly.",
      "When will the warrior dividend be paid?",
      "Military members are expected to receive their bonuses \"in the coming days,\" according to the White House.",
      "\"The checks are already on the way,\" Mr. Trump said from the White House on Wednesday. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military, and I say, 'congratulations' to everybody.\"",
      "In its statement on Thursday, the White House said service members can expect to receive the payments before Dec. 20.",
      "How is the dividend funded?",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested the \"warrior dividend\" payments are being funded both by his administration's tariffs and the\u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law this summer.",
      "The payments, which are expected to total $2.6 billion, will come from a $2.9 billion appropriation to the military in the new tax and spending law, a senior administration official told CBS News.",

      "Some small business owners say they are facing their own affordability crisis because of higher tariff, health insurance and energy costs.",
      "Shirley Modlin, who owns 3D Design and Manufacturing in Powhatan, Virginia, told CBS News that rising operational expenses are making it tough for her to offer raises and health insurance for her 10 workers.",
      "Modlin, whose company makes metal parts for the automotive, pharmaceutical, beverage and other industries, said uncertainty over where U.S. tariff rates will settle makes it hard to forecast her costs.",
      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like I am in a balancing act, and if I don't raise prices and my costs are going up, that squeezes my margins harder,\" she added.",
      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality\u00a0of Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs soon. If they are struck down, however, he has other tools he can employ to implement similar levies, according to legal experts.",
      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",
      "In November, 34% of small businesses raised their average selling prices, an unusually sharp jump from previous months, according to Bank of America analysts, citing recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.",
      "The S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17\u2014 a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.",
      "The key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0percolate?",
      "\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"",
      "Other forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.",
      "J.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.",
      "What will drive stocks in 2026?",
      "Several catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.",
      "\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"",
      "The AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.",
      "Another area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers.",
      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 11:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Instacart's AI-driven pricing technology has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is now probing the company over its use of the tool, according to\u00a0Reuters.",
      "\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" \u00a0the FTC said in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's media company is joining forces with a company working to commercialize fusion energy.",
    "story": [
      "Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.",
      "TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.",
      "The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT \u2014 the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.",
      "After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.",
      "Trump Media's strategic shift",
      "For Trump Media, the merger represents another strategic shift, given its 2021 launch as a business focusing on the conservative-leaning social media space.",
      "More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with \"America-first\" strategies.",
      "The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's \"America first\" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.",
      "\"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology,\" Nunes said on the call.",
      "He added, \"This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance.\"",
      "After the merger closes next year, the company will \"quickly seek approvals to site and build the company's first utility-scale power plant,\" Nunes said. \"We expect siting to commence by year-end 2026, sending us on the path to build future plants expected to be 350 megawatt to 500 megawatt.\"",
      "AI power needs",
      "With tech companies building AI data centers across the U.S., their need for power is \"growing exponentially,\" according to a report earlier this year from Deloitte. Power demand for AI data centers could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, up to 123 gigawatts from 4 gigawatts last year, the consulting firm noted.",
      "The combination represents \"a major play on creating the first public nuclear fusion company in the U.S.,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. TAE's investors include Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs, he noted.",
      "TAE has \"safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years... putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,\" Ives said.",
      "Fusion power will prove to be \"the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Nunes said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Economists had expected CPI to rise at an annual rate of 3% last month.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers are warning travelers to beware of a range of scams that tend to proliferate during the holiday season, including phishing schemes involving phony websites, as well as criminals who impersonate airlines and hotels.",
      "Online travel fraud has surged, accounting for $1 trillion in global financial losses in 2024, according to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which issued the warning on Wednesday. For example, such scams can lead to consumers paying for fake trips or booking accommodations that look nothing like how they are pictured online.",
      "\"While the winter holidays are one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, they're also one of the busiest seasons for scammers impersonating airlines, hotels and rental platforms,\" U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, the panel's ranking member, said in a statement. \"As millions of Americans prepare to travel to see their loved ones over the next few weeks, everyone should also prepare to protect themselves against rampant travel scams.\"",
      "The JEC, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers that advises Congress on economic issues, also called on the Federal Trade Commission to indicate what steps it is taking alongside U.S. technology companies to protect consumers from overseas scam networks. Organized foreign criminals stole $10 billion from Americans in 2024, up 66% from the prior year.",
      "In a letter, the panel pressed the FTC to detail how it is working with social media sites, dating platforms, financial technology companies and other actors to disrupt travel fraud. Lawmakers also requested details on how much money the FTC has allocated to protect Americans from overseas fraud.",
      "The panel's Democratic minority cited data from travel and payment firms showing a sharp rise in online fraud around the holidays.",
      "Travel fraud is among the most common types of criminal activity, according to the\u00a0FTC, which said it accounted for $274 million in U.S. consumer losses in 2024. Research from the Mastercard Economics Institute has found that\u00a0fraud spikes by up to 28%\u00a0during peak travel seasons.",
      "Common travel scams",
      "Criminals employ a range of tactics to extract payment details or other personal information from travelers. One common ploy is to send a text message claiming that a person's flight has been canceled, according to the JEC.",
      "\"These texts, which appear to come from major airlines, direct customers to a fake number or link to rebook their travel,\" warned the panel, which advises people to verify any schedule changes with their airline.",
      "Scammers may also pose as legitimate business representatives in replying to travelers' social media posts about flight delays or other travel headaches. In addition, fraudsters are known to pay to appear in online search results, advertising phony customer service numbers that lead directly to a scammer.",
      "How to avoid getting burned",
      "The JEC advised travelers always to consult official company websites or apps when seeking information, and not to click on links sent by text or email directing them to a website. Consumers should also be leery of online ads, sponsored search results or links posted on social media, the lawmakers warned.",
      "If a travel company is unfamiliar, meanwhile, the panel advises travelers to check sites like the Better Business Bureau, where other customers can post reviews and complaints. Clues indicating a possible scam include misspelled or extra words in a website address.",
      "Consumers should also beware vendors that describe accommodations as luxurious, but don't provide details such as a hotel's name or location, the JEC said. If a company does not list its cancellation or refund policy, or requests payment in cryptocurrency, that could also be suspicious, according to the committee.",

    "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said Ray Dalio, the founder of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, will donate to the Trump accounts initiative.",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday unveiled the new website for the Trump Accounts program, a tax-deferred investment vehicle for American children. He also announced a new Trump Accounts partner, billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio.",
      "At a briefing on the program, Bessent projected that the $1,000 deposited into a Trump Account by the government when a child is born would grow to over $600,000 by retirement age, assuming that the historic growth rate continues. For families who invest $5,000 each year in the accounts, that sum would grow to $1 million, he added.",
      "Parents may sign up their children by making an election on a new IRS form \u2014 Form 4547 \u2014 when they file their taxes. A financial institution will receive the child's funds and activate the account. Trump accounts are to be invested in an authorized investment, like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028 are eligible to receive the $1,000 government contribution into their accounts. Children under 18 who have a Social Security number can receive up to $5,000 each year from parents, guardians or others in their account.",
      "Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, is contributing $75 million as part of a 50-state push for businesses and philanthropic organizations to donate in each state. Dalio will \"boost funding for Trump accounts for kids across Connecticut,\" Bessent said.",
      "\"Ray and Barbara Dalio through Dalio Philanthropies announced today that they are joining the Dell family in seeding the new Trump Administration investment accounts with an additional $250 per child for approximately 300,000 children in Connecticut,\" the Dalios said in a statement on their foundation's website.",
      "The accounts were created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill earlier this year. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for the one-time $1,000 government contribution.",
      "Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell donated a historic $6.25 billion earlier this month, pledging to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million children ages 10 and younger as an incentive to save for the future.",
      "Families will be able to start making financial contributions on July 5, 2026. They won't be able to withdraw funds from the Trump account before a child turns 18, except under certain conditions.",

      "A robocall scam is targeting hundreds of thousands of consumers each week, with fraudsters impersonating employees of Walmart in an effort to obtain people's personal information, according to a telecommunications security company and the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "Targets of the scheme receive a call from someone claiming to be from Walmart asking if they have authorized the purchase of a PlayStation 5 video game console and accompanying 3D headset. The person is then invited to \"cancel\" the order by connecting with a live customer service representative, who asks for credit card, Social Security number and other personal data.",
      "YouMail, which makes technology to block robocalls and scam texts, has been tracking calls associated with the so-called phishing campaign in cooperation with the FCC.",
      "\"It's too easy to get tricked when you feel pressure to act right away to address a problem that might cost you money,\" YouMail CEO Alex Quilici told CBS News in an email, noting that the scam targets tens of millions of U.S. consumers.",
      "What you'll be told",
      "YouMail said the thieves behind the scam tend to stick to the following script:",
      "\"Hi, this is [NAME] from Walmart, and this is not a telemarketing call. We have detected a pre-authorized purchase of $919.45 for a PlayStation 5 and 3D headset, recently placed through a Walmart account registered to your name and phone number. If you did not authorize this purchase, press 1 to speak with a Walmart representative immediately.\"",
      "According to YouMail data, the bad actors have used more than 50 aliases as part of the ongoing robocall scam. They relied mainly on male names like David, Brandon, Michael and Paul earlier in the campaign, before swapping them for more female aliases in the second half of this year, such as Olivia, Jessica and Naomi.",
      "The scam first surfaced as early as 2023, and Quilici said it has expanded since then. \"Most campaigns start at low volume before they ramp,\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, the FCC issued a letter to the CEO of SK Teleco, raising concerns that the South Korea-based telecommunications company could be transmitting the scam robocalls and ordering it to block the calls.",
      "SK Teleco could not be reached for comment.",
      "\"Scammers and thieves using our phone networks to defraud consumers or steal personal data is illegal, and voice service providers must be part of the solution,\" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a Dec. 2 statement.",
      "The FCC declined further comment, citing the agency's ongoing investigation into the scam.",
      "The scammers are targeting Walmart because it is a trusted brand with a huge customer base, according to Iskander Sanchez-Rola, director of AI and innovation for Norton, a cybersecurity company.",
      "\"Walmart shoppers may also be more vulnerable, since many are budget-conscious and quick to react to unexpected charges, especially when the scam uses realistic AI-generated voices that sound similar to the automated calls they already receive from the retailer,\" he said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Walmart directed customers seeking more information about scams to the company's fraud alert\u00a0page.",
      "Billions of calls per month",
      "Americans now receive roughly\u00a02.5 billion robocalls a month, according to an October report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization.",

    "summary": "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, its highest level since September 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as new October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:25:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads, which would create the first U.S. transcontinental railroad, has lost the support of two major unions.",
    "story": [
      "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half their workers because they're worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision, which they plan to announce Wednesday, will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups, and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Trump.",
      "The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Unions finding fault",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and that it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives, they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs of all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\"This proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between 'Hell or the highway.'\"",
      "The unions say they're worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides in the two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they're optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Over 99% of shareholders of both lines voted in favor of the combination last month.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago, it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Outside views mixed",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",
      "Currently, Norfolk Southern and CSX serve the eastern U.S. while Union Pacific and BNSF serve the west, and the two major Canadian rails compete where they can with their tracks crossing Canada and extending down into the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"This merger is like nothing we've seen before. It's creating a railroad of such enormous scope that it's somewhat of a paradigm shift,\" Schwieterman said.",
      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",
      "\"No customer is asking for this. This is strictly a Wall Street play for shareholders,\" Andersen said.",
      "Earlier this fall, Buffett and CPKC's CEO both said they weren't interested in any kind of rail merger right now. Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 16:29:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Newly released documents are renewing interest in how Jeffrey Epstein amassed his fortune. Here's how he made his money.",
    "story": [
      "Newly released financial documents and photos obtained from the estate of convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0are reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The photos, released Dec. 12 by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, include images of prominent figures such as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Earlier in the month, the same committee had released financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as photos and videos of the financier's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018.",
      "Separately from the Oversight Committee's document release, Congress has passed a bill last month giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. President Trump signed the bill into law on Nov. 19.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has proved politically sensitive\u00a0after Mr. Trump returned to office in January of 2025. The president had earlier urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue, initially describing the effort to release more records as a distraction tactic, but reversed his stance in November.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has been accused of no wrongdoing, had been friends with Epstein but later cut his ties with the businessman.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank in 2023 for a reported $290 million. The money was slated to go to almost 200 Epstein victims, according to the New York Times.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "In October, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, pointed to\u00a0$1.5 billion in suspicious financial transactions that had been flagged by the banks and were tied to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking crimes. The same month, Bank of America was sued by one of Epstein's victims, who alleged the bank facilitated and also benefited from his alleged crimes.",
      "Bank of America had no comment on the lawsuit.",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Hyundai and Kia owners can get free repairs under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.",
      "The settlement comes after a rash of Hyundai and Kia thefts prompted nearly two dozen state attorneys general in 2023 to demand the automakers take action.",
      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "story": [
      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",

      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the Kennedy Center website had updated its logo to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to put his stamp\u00a0on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts soon after he returned to the White House for his second term. He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \"honored\" and \"surprised\" by the vote, and praised the board as \"very distinguished.\"",
      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and opened its doors in 1971. It recognizes achievements in music, theater and dance each year with its honors ceremony. The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, will\u00a0air on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",
      "Because the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, any change to its name would appear to require approval from lawmakers. Still, Mr. Trump from sought to unilaterally make sweeping changes to other federal entities that would require congressional action.",
      "The president in September signed an executive order to begin the process of renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The directive allowed the Pentagon to start using Department of War as a \"secondary title\" and let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title of secretary of war.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that sought to dismantle the Department of Education. Fully eliminating the agency would require an act of Congress.",
      "House Republicans have already proposed renaming the Kennedy Center's opera house after first lady Melania Trump.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 11:05:18 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have unveiled charges against six more people accused of defrauding programs in Minnesota \u2014 adding to a scandal that has ensnared over 90 people..",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors unveiled charges Thursday against another six people, accusing them of defrauding public assistance programs in Minnesota \u2014 including two men they allege traveled to the state for that express purpose.",
      "The latest indictments add fuel to a scandal that has now led to charges against\u00a0more than 90 people who have been accused, and in many cases convicted, of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from the Midwestern state, putting Gov. Tim Walz's administration in the hot seat and drawing attacks from President Trump.",
      "Thursday's charges focus on housing assistance and autism services. And the pandemic-era food aid fraud case that set off the scandal is still brewing.",
      "Minnesota is far from the only state that has grappled with allegations of public assistance fraud, especially scams targeting pandemic aid funds. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Minnesota faces a particularly large problem, pointing to 14 different Medicaid programs that the state has flagged for \"significant fraud problems.\" He suggested total losses could reach into the billions.",
      "\"The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated,\" Thompson said at a press conference Thursday. \"What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "Walz, whose administration has faced scrutiny for its handling of the issue, has vowed to crack down. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has sharply criticized Minnesota \u2014 and he's lashed out at the state's large Somali-American community as most, but not all, of the defendants are of Somali descent.",
      "Here's what to know about the new charges and the wider scandal:",
      "Pennsylvania natives accused of \"fraud tourism\" in housing program",
      "An alleged fraud scheme involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota expanded Thursday, as federal prosecutors charged five new people with wire fraud \u2014 including two Philadelphia men who allegedly traveled from halfway across the country because they heard the state programs presented \"a good opportunity to make money.\"",
      "The program in question was launched in 2020 to help seniors and people with disabilities find, apply for, move into and stay in housing. Offered as a benefit in Minnesota's Medicaid plan, it was recognized at the time as the nation's first program of its kind. State officials shut it down earlier this year, however, after finding \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors have said in the past that the program was vulnerable to fraud because of its \"low barriers to entry\" and light recordkeeping rules.",
      "In court papers, prosecutors claim the two Pennsylvanians signed up as providers for the program despite no clear ties to the state. The two men allegedly submitted some $3.5 million in claims, often sending in \"fake and inflated bills,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Thompson said the state \"has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry.\"",
      "A third defendant was charged with fraudulently claiming $1.4 million. Prosecutors say he flew to Amsterdam shortly after he was subpoenaed by federal authorities last month, and he has not returned to the U.S. since then. And two other new defendants were accused of submitting around $750,000 in fraudulent claims for the program.",
      "The Justice Department charged eight other people with allegedly defrauding the same program in September. Six of those defendants have pleaded not guilty, and two pleaded guilty.",
      "New charges in alleged autism services fraud scheme",
      "Charges were also unsealed Thursday in an alleged fraud scheme that hit a second state program, one that provides services to children with autism.",
      "Prosecutors allege that the new defendant in this case raked in millions from Medicaid reimbursements, many of which were inflated or for services that weren't provided.",
      "In court papers, the Justice Department alleged the defendant's company claimed to offer one-on-one behavioral therapy to children with autism, but actually employed \"unqualified\" 18- and 19-year-olds. He allegedly recruited parents within Minnesota's Somali community to sign up for the program, helped to get their kids qualified for autism services and, in some cases, paid kickbacks to the parents.",
      "Federal officials charged a different person with defrauding Minnesota's autism program in September, leveling similar allegations. That defendant pleaded guilty on Thursday.",
      "As with the housing stabilization program, claims in the autism program have grown rapidly in recent years, according to court papers unsealed by the government on Thursday.",
      "CBS News has reached out to attorneys for the six defendants who were charged Thursday for comment.",
      "Feds tease another possible fraud case",
      "The Justice Department unsealed a search warrant Thursday for a Minnesota business that participated in yet another state Medicaid-funded program, which offers health and safety assistance at home for adults with disabilities.",
      "The business and its owners have not been criminally charged. CBS News has reached out to the business for comment.",
      "In an affidavit attached to the search warrant, an FBI agent claimed there was a \"massive scheme to defraud\" the state's Integrated Community Supports program, which he said has faced an \"explosion in fly-by-night operators\" since it was created in 2021. State officials flagged similar concerns about the program earlier this year, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.",
      "Thompson said Thursday that instead of giving day-to-day help to clients, some providers \"simply obtained apartments or condos \u2026 and then just put them in there and started billing,\" sometimes to the tune of hundreds of dollars a day.",
      "Scandal started with Feeding Our Future fraud case",
      "The largest known COVID-era fraud scheme \u2014 and the first one to fall into the federal government's crosshairs \u2014 targeted programs that offered food to needy children.",
      "The Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute millions of meals during the pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged; at least 56 have pleaded guilty and seven have been convicted, including the group's leader. Prosecutors have put the losses at almost $250 million.",
      "Here's how prosecutors allege\u00a0it worked: Feeding Our Future recruited hundreds of local groups and businesses to run distribution sites and submitted reimbursement claims for the meals. The Minnesota Department of Education then paid out the claims using federal dollars. But many of those claims were falsified, with phony invoices and attendance rosters filled with fake children's names.",
      "Feeding Our Future collected millions in administrative fees and raked in kickbacks from the operators of its local sites, according to an indictment against founder Aimee Bock, who was convicted this year of wire fraud and several other charges. Dozens of site operators who worked with Feeding Our Future or other sponsors have also been charged, many of whom have been convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Bock has long denied any wrongdoing. Her attorney has said she plans to appeal.",
      "Some of the defendants who ran distribution sites spent the taxpayer money on lavish personal expenses like lakefront property, luxury cars, jewelry, first-class plane tickets and a rented private villa in the Maldives, according to documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The scheme was part of a wave of pandemic fraud nationwide. Prosecutors say the Feeding Our Future defendants took advantage of a COVID-era expansion of the child nutrition program.",
      "State auditors have faulted the Minnesota Department of Education for its handling of the situation, too. Minnesota's Office of Legislative Auditor said last year the state agency \"created opportunities for fraud\" by missing warning signs and failing to address complaints.",
      "The report also claimed the agency was stymied by Feeding Our Future's history of accusing the state of racial discrimination when officials started taking a closer look at the group. The organization's founder is White, but most of those charged in the scheme are of Somali descent, and the group said in a 2020 lawsuit against the state that it primarily served minority communities.",
      "State officials spotted early signs of fraud before the COVID-19 pandemic began, but faced pressure from Feeding Our Future to stop asking questions, CBS News previously reported. An attorney for Bock denied that she pressured state officials.",
      "Trump weighs in \u2014 and links it to Somalia",
      "Mr. Trump has ripped Minnesota over the controversy, calling the state a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and claiming Somali immigrants have \"ripped off that state.\"",
      "He has lashed out at Somali people in often-incendiary terms, calling them \"garbage\" and claiming they \"contribute nothing.\" Frequent targets of his ire include Walz and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager.",
      "Walz and Omar, in turn, have denounced the president for his rhetoric, which the governor called \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Roughly 76,000 people of Somali descent lived in Minnesota last year, 52% of whom were born in the U.S. and 42% of whom were naturalized citizens, according to Census Bureau data.",
      "Immigration authorities launched a crackdown in early December in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and Mr. Trump has said he will revoke deportation protections for potentially hundreds of Somali migrants in Minnesota.",
      "The fraud scandal itself has also drawn attention from the Trump administration. The U.S. Treasury says it is investigating whether Minnesota tax money went to the Somali terror group al Shabaab, following allegations in the conservative magazine City Journal. But multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "\"The vast majority of the money that these folks made went to spending on luxury items for themselves,\" said Andy Luger, the former U.S. attorney who led the office which prosecuted these frauds from 2022 until January. \"There was never any evidence that this money went to fund terrorism nor was there any evidence that was the intent of the 70 people we indicted.\"",
      "A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that funding from one program was going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have found their way to terrorists.",
      "Walz's handling of fraud scandal under scrutiny",
      "Republicans at the state and national level have criticized Walz for years, accusing him and other state officials of being slow to act on warning signs of fraud. Walz has led Minnesota since 2019, but he gained national prominence after serving as the Democratic nominee for vice president last year.",
      "Earlier this month, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee opened an investigation into alleged fraud in Minnesota state programs, requesting documents from Walz.",
      "Walz has long defended the state's handling of the situation. He said in 2022 that officials caught the Feeding Our Future scheme early on, but couldn't take further action due to an order from a judge and a request from the FBI not to do anything that could harm its investigation.",
      "The governor said last week that he will \"take responsibility\" for the mistakes that led to theft of taxpayer dollars. But he added that the \"guardrails were taken off\" by the federal government during the pandemic, and \"the guidance was to move the money.\"",
      "Walz launched a new fraud prevention program on Dec. 12, led by a former FBI agent. He applauded the new federal charges on Thursday.",
      "\"This is exactly the type of strong action we need from prosecutors to ensure fraudsters are put behind bars,\" Walz said in a statement. \"We will not tolerate fraud, and we will continue to work with federal partners to ensure fraud is stopped and fraudsters are caught.\"",
      "James Clark, inspector general of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said in a statement Thursday the agency \"has been moving more aggressively than ever to suspend payments where we see evidence of fraud.\" He also urged federal officials to share information with the agency, which oversees many of the programs that were hit by fraud allegations.",
      "\"If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses,\" Clark said.",
      "Michael  Kaplan and \n                                                  \n                                  Jonah  Kaplan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used by Brown University shooting suspect Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced late Thursday that the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used eight years ago by the now-deceased man accused of killing two Brown University students and an MIT professor.",
      "\"This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,\" Noem said on X. \"At President Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"",
      "Noem said the suspected shooter, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the United States through the program in 2017 and was issued a green card.",
      "What is the diversity visa program?",
      "Launched in the 1990s, the program offers 50,000 visas per year to people from countries with relatively low rates of immigration to the U.S., with recipients selected at random using a lottery. Every year, tens of millions of people vie for visas through the program.",
      "In order to qualify for a diversity visa, applicants must have at least a high school education or two years of work experience in a field that requires training. They are also required to undergo vetting and an interview before getting a visa.",
      "The program was created by Congress, and it's not clear under what legal mechanism Noem can order a pause. Most visas issued through the lottery are overseen by the State Department, though a small number are processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 which is part of DHS \u2014 for applicants already in the U.S.",
      "Criticism from Trump administration",
      "President Trump is a longstanding critic of the diversity visa lottery program, arguing it could pose security risks and isn't sufficiently merit-based, like employment-based visas. He pushed to end it early in his first term, after a man who had received a diversity visa killed eight people in a truck-ramming attack in New York City. Supporters of the visas say recipients are vetted and argue the program is good for the U.S. economy and the country's image abroad.",
      "The first Trump administration suspended the program in 2020, part of a\u00a0broader set of restrictions\u00a0on legal immigration that cited the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0reversed that policy\u00a0in 2021.",
      "Shooting suspect in the U.S.",
      "Neves Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, officials said in a press conference late Thursday.",
      "More than a decade before getting a diversity visa, Neves Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa in 2000 to attend graduate school at Brown University, according to a local police affidavit that was attached to his arrest warrant. Brown's president says he studied at the Ivy League school for a few months starting in the fall of 2000, but he took a leave of absence in the spring of 2001 and formally withdrew two years later.",
      "Authorities said Neves Valente was found dead by suicide in a storage unit in New Hampshire late Thursday, ending a days-long investigation following a shooting at Brown that killed two students and wounded nine over the weekend. Authorities say he is also believed to be responsible for the deadly shooting of an MIT professor in suburban Boston two days after the shooting at Brown.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:37:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Jack Smith, who oversaw two investigations into President Trump, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for a closed-door deposition Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith reiterated their call for Smith to appear publicly before lawmakers to answer questions about his investigations into President Trump after he testified privately earlier in the week.",
      "Smith appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a closed-door deposition and answered questions for roughly nine hours, his lawyers, Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said in a letter to the panel's chairman, Jim Jordan, that was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Mr. Smith welcomed this opportunity and hopes that it will serve to correct the many mischaracterizations about the work of the Special Counsel's Office,\" they wrote in the letter, dated Thursday.",
      "Breuer and Koski urged Jordan, an Ohio Republican, to promptly release the full videotape of the deposition and said \"doing so will ensure that the American people can hear the facts directly from Mr. Smith, rather than through second-hand accounts.\" Koski and Breuer also reiterated their request for Smith to address lawmakers in an \"open and public hearing.\"",
      "\"During the investigation of President Trump, Mr. Smith steadfastly followed Justice Department policies, observed all legal requirements, and took actions based on the facts and the law. He stands by his decisions,\" they wrote to Jordan.",
      "Politico first reported the letter from Smith's lawyers to Jordan. Two former special counsels, Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have each testified in open forums about their respective investigations. Mueller\u00a0examined Russian interference\u00a0in the 2016 election, and Hur\u00a0probed former President Joe Biden's handling\u00a0of sensitive government documents.",
      "Smith was tapped as special counsel during the Biden administration to take over the Justice Department's investigations into Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents and his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Mr. Trump faced a total of more than 40 charges in both of those cases, though they ended after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Now, with Republicans in control of Congress, they have begun investigating the prosecutions. Smith had offered in October to voluntarily answer questions in an open hearing before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, but Jordan issued a subpoena to the former special counsel demanding Smith's testimony at a closed-door deposition.",
      "In his opening statement to lawmakers, which was obtained by CBS News, Smith defended the prosecutions of Mr. TRump and said he made decisions \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "He said his investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 election developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the president engaged in a scheme to overturn the results of the last presidential contest. As to the case involving the president's handling of documents marked classified, Smith told lawmakers that his investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Smith also defended investigative steps taken by his team, which included obtaining phone records of nine sitting GOP members of Congress as part of his probe related to the 2020 election. The data was for several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to keep Congress from certifying the election results.",
      "The former special counsel said the records were \"lawfully subpoenaed\" and relevant to his investigation.",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith told the Judiciary Committee. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "On his first day back in the White House, the president issued sweeping pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate confirmed Admiral Kevin Lunday as Coast Guard commandant Thursday night after agency guidance on the display of hate symbols such as swastikas and nooses was clarified. Democrats objecting to the guidance had been holding up the confirmation.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, called for and got senators to approve Lunday unanimously in remarks before the chamber adjourned for the year.",
      "After references to the hate symbols as \"potentially divisive\" were removed from Coast Guard policy, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she was lifting a hold she'd placed on Lunday's nomination for the agency's top job.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said on social media that the latest changes were made so no one can \"misrepresent\" the branch's position.",
      "\"The pages of superseded and outdated policy will be completely removed from the record so no press outlet, entity or elected official may misrepresent the Coast Guard to politicize their policies and lie about their position on divisive and hate symbols,\" Noem said.",
      "The move capped back-and-forth revisions of the Coast Guard policy on swastikas, nooses and other hate symbols that had sparked an uproar. The Department of Homeland Security has asserted there \"was never a 'downgrade'\" in policy language.",
      "Rosen had said she was holding up Lunday's nomination because leadership appeared to have \"backtracked\" on a commitment that swastikas and nooses are considered hate symbols and prohibited from display.",
      "Rosen said Thursday on social media that she was lifting the hold and looked forward to working with Lunday to continue strengthening anti-harassment policies at the Coast Guard.",
      "\"While I continue to have reservations about the process by which this happened and the confusion created by leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, I am pleased to see that the policy now directly refers to stronger language against swastikas and nooses,\" she said.",
      "Noem called the delay of Lunday's nomination a \"politicized holdup,\" saying it had gone on long enough and he should be confirmed without delay.",
      "\"He has given nearly 39 years of distinguished service to the Coast Guard, this country, and the American people,\" she said.",
      "The Coast Guard's planned policy change calling hate symbols \"potentially divisive\" emerged publicly last month. It stopped short of banning them, instead saying that commanders could take steps to remove them from public view and that the rule did not apply to private spaces, such as family housing.",
      "DHS has said the change \"strengthens our ability to report, investigate, and prosecute those who violate longstanding policy.\"",
      "The Coast Guard said on social media that it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward hate symbols, extremist ideology, and any conduct that undermines our core values. We prohibit the display or promotion of hate symbols in any form. Any suggestion otherwise is false.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-vaccine-memo-uproar/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad\u200b, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, may signal an effort to to rewrite the rules governing the U.S. vaccine system.",
    "story": [
      "Six days after a senior FDA official sent a sweeping internal email claiming that COVID vaccines had caused the deaths of \"at least 10 children,\" 12 former FDA commissioners released an extraordinary warning in the Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "They wrote that the claims and policy changes in the memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose \"a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security\" and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.",
      "What is unfolding inside the Food and Drug Administration is not a narrow dispute over COVID vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system \u2014 how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.",
      "Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. \"Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it,\" he wrote, telling employees the agency's mission, and its \"worldview,\" would change.",
      "Prasad's email reopened old arguments about COVID vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that FDA staff had found \"at least 10\" deaths in children that happened \"after and because of\" COVID vaccination, using reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.",
      "The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.",
      "On Substack, Inside Medicine reported Dec. 11 that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from COVID shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, \"The FDA's investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there's no final count yet of those deaths.\"",
      "Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have \"harmed more children than we saved,\" adding that \"we do not know if we saved lives on balance.\"",
      "By comparison, more than 2,100 American children died of COVID itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.",
      "Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about COVID vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.",
      "Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it's unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.",
      "\"There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease,\" said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.",
      "Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an \"evidence-based catastrophe,\" questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new \"worldview\" and said anyone who disagreed with his \"core principles\" should resign.",
      "The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to COVID to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.",
      "\"This is really different. And it's really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions,\" former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad's proposed policies \u2014 which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist \u2014 could shake the entire vaccine market.",
      "\"The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.,\" he said. If the proposals advance, he added,\"it won't be a viable business.\"",
      "Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: \"The American people deserve evidence-based science. Dr. Prasad's email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children's deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate.\"",
      "For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad's ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.",
      "Fueling parental doubt",
      "Prasad's memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children's deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an \"early warning system\" for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.",
      "\"VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies,\" said Dr. Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.",
      "Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.",
      "\"Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence,\" said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.",
      "Prasad's framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.",
      "Experts fear this doubt won't stay limited to COVID vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA's honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough \u2014 shots that have protected children for decades.",
      "\"Science must be transparent,\" Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. \"There's a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that's not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet.\"",
      "Delicate vaccine pipeline",
      "Prasad's new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, \"would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses.\"",
      "For fast-changing viruses like flu and COVID, this could be disastrous. There's simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.",
      "There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.",
      "Rising fear, falling standards, and under strain",
      "Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad's memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks \"unethical\" and \"illegal.\"",
      "Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA's Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. \"If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest,\" she said.",
      "Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. \"You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible,\" said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the COVID pandemic.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government has expanded a sweeping pause on legal immigration applications to include those filed by people from an additional 20 countries that President Trump added to his \"travel ban\" proclamation this week, a U.S. official with direct knowledge told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "The move, which mainly affects immigrants who hail from certain African and Asian countries, further escalates a wide-ranging crackdown on legal immigration expanded by the Trump administration this month. Many of those affected by the pause are likely to be legal immigrants who are currently in the U.S. and are seeking to change their status or become citizens.",
      "Earlier in December, the Trump administration directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to completely freeze all immigration petitions \u2014 including requests for American citizenship and permanent residency \u2014 made by those already in the U.S. who are nationals of the 19 countries he banned or restricted travel from in June. That order is colloquially known as the \"travel ban.\"",
      "It was one of several immigration restrictions the administration announced in the wake of the Thanksgiving week shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., an attack allegedly carried out by an Afghan national. The administration also suspended all decisions for asylum cases handled by USCIS and the processing of all immigration and visa requests by Afghans.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump expanded that \"travel ban\" proclamation to include 20 additional nations, fully barring immigrants and travelers from 5 new countries and partially restricting the entry of people from another 15 nations.",
      "A U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal changes that have not been formally announced told CBS News on Thursday that USCIS has expanded its suspension of immigration cases to include the new nationalities added to Mr. Trump's proclamation on Tuesday.",
      "The pause will now affect nationals of Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria, the new countries facing full travel bans. It will also impact those hailing from Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The last set of countries face partial restrictions under the latest proclamation.",
      "Previously, the suspension of immigration cases applied to nationals of Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Laos, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Yemen and Venezuela. In his latest proclamation, Mr. Trump imposed a full entry ban on citizens of Laos and Sierra Leone, which previously faced partial restrictions.",
      "In a statement posed on social media late Thursday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow appeared to reference the expansion.",
      "\"USCIS is conducting a comprehensive review of anyone from anywhere who poses a threat to the U.S., including those identified in the President's latest proclamation to restore law and order in our nation's immigration system,\" Edlow wrote.",
      "Taken together, Mr. Trump's latest \"travel ban\" decree affects nationals of over 60% of the countries in Africa and roughly 20% of all nations across the globe.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued the broad restrictions are designed to safeguard national security and address concerns about the ability to vet people from the affected nations. But critics of his administration have denounced the policy as discriminatory, since it mainly applies to nations in Africa and Asia.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an order to reschedule marijuana to a lower drug classification, one of the most significant changes to drug policy in decades.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to reschedule marijuana to a lower drug classification, one of the most significant changes to drug policy in decades.",
      "\"Today I'm pleased to announce that I will be signing an executive order to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance, with legitimate medical uses,\" Mr. Trump said in a ceremony in the Oval Office on Thursday, flanked by medical professionals. \"We have people begging for me to do this. People who are in great pain.\"",
      "He added: \"I think I probably have received more phone calls on this, on doing what we're doing \u2014 I don't think I received any calls on the other side of it.\"",
      "The order directs the attorney general to \"take all necessary steps to complete the rulemaking process\" to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug \"in the most expeditious manner.\" According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Schedule I applies to substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" \u2014 the agency's most stringent classification, which is also for heroin, LSD and ecstasy in addition to marijuana.",
      "The DEA uses Schedule III for substances \"with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" Other Schedule III drugs include Tylenol with codeine, testosterone, anabolic steroids and ketamine.",
      "\"For decades, this action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more,\" the president said.",
      "Moving the drug to a lower schedule does not change the fact that it remains illegal for recreational use at the federal level. But it could open the door to more research into marijuana and expanded medical uses. It might also lower the tax burden for state-licensed marijuana dispensaries in the dozens of states that have legalized the drug, since federal law bars businesses that sell Schedule I substances from taking some tax deductions.",
      "\"Rescheduling will help accelerate research, reduce stigma, attract new investment, and ease some of the tax burdens that have held the industry back. The next transformation will happen when interstate commerce barriers between states are removed,\" said Vince C. Ning, the co-CEO and co-founder of cannabis wholesale platform Nabis.",
      "\"We will have answers very soon. This will allow us to study this issue and to answer these questions for the American people,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the White House.",
      "The president said during his campaign last year that he believes marijuana should instead be a Schedule III drug.",
      "The Biden-era Department of Health and Human Services also recommended bumping marijuana down to Schedule III. The Justice Department, the DEA's parent agency, proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana last year, but the process became mired in over a year of legal and administrative wrangling, leaving the drug in Schedule I status.",
      "Marijuana has been deemed a Schedule I drug since the classification system was created in 1970. In recent years, however, most states have approved the drug for certain medical uses, and 24 states have legalized the drug recreationally. These state policies technically clash with federal law, but the federal government has opted against cracking down on cannabis businesses that are licensed by states.",
      "Some members of both parties have backed looser federal marijuana regulations, often pointing to potential medical benefits \u2014 and polling that shows Americans are increasingly supportive of legalizing medical or recreational uses of the drug.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump said he planned to vote yes on an unsuccessful Florida ballot measure to legalize marijuana recreationally in the state. The measure drew just under 56% of the vote, falling short of the 60% needed to pass.",
      "\"I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product,\" the president wrote on Truth Social last year.",
      "But some lawmakers remain wary. A group of 22 Republican senators wrote an open letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday urging him to leave marijuana in the Schedule I category, pointing to health concerns along with worries about intoxicated driving and worker absenteeism.",
      "\"We cannot reindustrialize America if we encourage marijuana use,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\"",
      "A group of nine House Republicans penned a letter over the summer urging Attorney General Pam Bondi not to shift marijuana to a lower schedule, arguing \"there is no adequate science or data\" to support the change.",
      "\"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter states. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Democrats called on GOP leaders to hold a last-minute vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits on Thursday as lawmakers are poised to head home for the holidays without addressing the expiring subsidies.",
      "\"We're demanding a vote today on extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits today \u2014 not tomorrow, not next week, not next month \u2014 today,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
      "Around 22 million Americans who purchase their health insurance through Affordable Care Act exchanges face a steep premium increase in the new year with the expiration of the enhanced tax credits on Dec. 31. And despite weeks of debate on Capitol Hill over the issue, which was at the center of the shutdown fight that ended last month, lawmakers have been unable to reach a resolution.",
      "Speaking alongside House Democrats on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday morning, Jeffries and his leadership team cited his discharge petition, which reached the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote on the tax credits a day earlier. Four moderate Republicans signed onto the petition\u00a0Wednesday after days of back and forth on the GOP health care strategy, breaking with their party leadership to back the measure.",
      "\"We have the votes, we have the momentum,\" Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said. \"We have the American people on our side. Let's not waste another second.\"",
      "But even with the success of the petition, a vote on extending the ACA tax credits isn't expected until the chamber reconvenes in January, since seven legislative days must elapse before a discharge motion can be brought to the floor. House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a \"rule that cannot be broken.\"",
      "\"That's the rule,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"There's no way around that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats urged Johnson to act sooner. \"Under no circumstances should the House of Representatives adjourn until we successfully extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for tens of millions of Americans,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Johnson does have the authority to move the process along. Last month, when another small group of Republicans broke with their leaders to sign onto a discharge petition to force the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, Johnson moved quickly to hold a vote on the underlying bill.",
      "But the speaker indicated that Republicans don't intend to address the health care issue until the new year. Johnson told reporters Wednesday that the measure will be considered during the first week of January upon the House's return, calling it \"inevitable.\" He added that Republicans plan to hold additional votes on their health care policies when they return.",
      "\"We'll be back in January to do much more of this,\" Johnson said.",
      "House GOP leaders canceled votes for Friday after the chamber on Wednesday approved a health care bill that Republicans say would lower health insurance premiums for Americans, but does not include an extension of the expiring ACA tax credits.",
      "Jeffries was asked Thursday afternoon whether he would consider supporting other bipartisan proposals to extend the credits with reforms, if the three-year extension makes it out of the House but fails in the Senate.",
      "\"The House has to work its will first,\" he replied. \"Once the House works its will \u2014 which should be taking place today, tomorrow, before the end of the year, but at least as early as when we get back in January \u2014 then we'll send the bill over to the Senate. And we'll see what the senators decide to do. We're not giving up this fight.\"",
      "Though imminent action appears out of the question, the movement on the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. After a meeting between so-called \"problem solvers\" in both the House and Senate on Wednesday, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed optimism about a solution.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told CBS News that the discharge petition in the House \"gives momentum to the bipartisan work that we've been trying to advance on the Senate side.\" She said she expects health care discussions will continue between both chambers over the holiday break. And the discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should moderate lawmakers reach a compromise.",

      "Schumer noted that every Democrat voted for a three-year extension last week. He added that if the measure passes the House, \"we hope Thune would put it on the floor and let it pass.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-kash-patel-erica-knight/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 16:16:50 -0500",
    "summary": "An FBI media adviser has emerged as one of Kash Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the bureau under his leadership.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel was enduring yet another round of negative headlines in October about his frequent use of the FBI's private jet \u2013 this time to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a freestyle wrestling event in State College, Pennsylvania.",
      "An FBI spokesman pushed back on the criticism, citing federal regulations requiring the FBI director to fly on government aircraft. But the most passionate retort came from a little-known FBI media adviser who has emerged as one of Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the FBI under his leadership.",
      "\"Shaming a woman the Director has happily dated for nearly three years is pathetic and, frankly, disgusting,\" Erica Knight wrote on X. \"Hot take \u2013 when someone's arrested 28,000 violent criminals and taken millions in drugs off the streets, maybe we can also support their happiness.\"",
      "It was a heartfelt but strikingly personal response from a law enforcement agency known for its buttoned-up communications style. But Knight is not the typical government spokeswoman. She's Patel's friend and longtime personal publicist, hired earlier this year to help shake up the bureau's communications strategy. She's also amplified the director's public messaging and touted what the FBI leadership sees as its successes.",
      "In one testament to their friendship, shortly after he was sworn in as FBI director, Patel posted a picture of himself in the Oval Office with Knight and wrote on X: \"I have been truly blessed to have the best captain and teammate @_ericaKnight \u2013 she has been there since day 1, without her I would not be in this position today. She is the best publicist in America, an absolute force.\"",
      "Glowing public testimonials like this have left some current and former FBI agents questioning Knight's taxpayer-funded role, especially since the FBI already has a sprawling media department.",
      "Those questions have surfaced amid growing concerns inside the agency. Two bureau sources tell CBS News that they believe Patel is using public resources in ways that push the boundaries of traditionally accepted FBI practice. Beyond the trips to visit his girlfriend, Patel has used FBI aircraft to go to sporting events \u2014 a golf outing in Scotland with friends and a trip to a private hunting reserve in Texas owned by the family of a GOP donor.",
      "He's also been slammed by critics for assigning FBI SWAT agents to protect his girlfriend, country music performer Alexis Wilkins, at taxpayer expense. (Wilkins has said she has been the target of multiple death threats since Patel became FBI director.)",
      "FBI officials say Patel reimburses the government for his personal flights and point out that federal regulations require him to use government aircraft for both personal and official travel. Nevertheless, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, recently announced a probe into Patel's use of public resources and is demanding he turn over documents related to the trips.",
      "Now, Raskin tells CBS News, he has questions about Patel's PR arrangement with Knight. Raskin has called on the FBI to disclose how much she is being paid.",
      "\"Why should an FBI Director have to hire a taxpayer-funded PR fixer to spin away public criticism,\" Raskin said in an email to CBS News. \"And if there's nothing to hide, then the bureau should have no problem releasing Ms. Knight's contract, showing exactly how much the American taxpayers are paying for her crisis PR services.\"",
      "FBI officials vigorously push back against the criticism, maintaining that Knight's job is not about tending to Patel's personal PR. Rather, they say she works closely in tandem with the Office of Public Affairs to promote the bureau's broader mission. In an interview with CBS News, a senior FBI official who asked not to be named called the notion that she serves only the director \"entirely false.\"",
      "\"She is not a PR representative for the director,\" the official said. \"She does specific work related to FBI communications.\"",
      "Still, a number of news outlets, including the New Yorker, CNN, Scripps News and Fox News, identified Knight in their reports as Patel's spokesperson or his adviser.",
      "Inside the agency, speculation about how much she's being paid has been widespread. Typically, such contracts are public, but the agency declined a request from CBS News for details of Knight's compensation, and Knight, in an interview, also declined to disclose information about her salary.",
      "\"The FBI absolutely needs to be more forward-leaning and transparent in terms of its communications,\" said Chris O'Leary, a former senior FBI agent. \"But Patel appears to be putting the spotlight on himself, rather than on the institution \u2013 at taxpayer expense.\"",
      "Federal salaries are typically public information. Knight, who works from outside of Washington, is not a federal employee but rather a contractor \u2013 an arrangement that makes it harder to determine her actual compensation. Her direct employer is Xpect Solutions, a technology and security services firm. The FBI has been a long-time customer of Xpect Solutions, and sources familiar with the arrangement say Knight's salary is paid to the company out of the FBI Office of Public Affairs budget. Xpect Solutions did not respond to a request for comment about Knight's employment.",
      "Ben Williamson, the FBI's assistant director for public affairs, told CBS News that Knight's contract with the FBI is \"entirely consistent with procurement rules and ethical guidelines, and any suggestion otherwise from CBS or elsewhere says more about their lack of basic research than it does anything else.\"",
      "Williamson said he and Knight, who reports both to him and Patel, speak daily. He described her as \"a valuable member of our press and communications office and one of the best operatives I've worked with in a decade.\"",
      "Patel met Knight after he left the first Trump administration in 2021 \u2013 the two were introduced by a mutual friend, according to a source familiar with the relationship. Knight was a publicist and crisis communications specialist with a growing client list; and Patel was on a mission to raise his profile.",
      "With Knight's help, Patel flooded the media with cable news and podcast appearances, lucrative speeches and book events, all aimed at cheering on the MAGA agenda and defending Donald Trump.",
      "The effort helped put him on the short list for FBI director, and when he was selected to the post, Knight came along.",
      "Since joining the government PR team, Knight has become a relentless champion of her client, touting the FBI's law-and-order accomplishments (\"President Trump's administration and Director Patel's FBI are dismantling the cartels and crushing the fentanyl crisis,\" she posted on X last month).",
      "In some ways, the role is not new \u2013 the FBI has long had a vast PR operation \u2014 one FBI source said there are well over 150\u00a0 staff in the bureau's office of public affairs, with 60 or so working out of headquarters in Washington and the rest in the bureau's 56 field offices. J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of bureau headquarters.",
      "For his part, Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, Marine and federal prosecutor, had little time for mingling with reporters and had no social media presence.",
      "James Comey, according to one of his advisers, believed more public engagement was critical to restoring trust in the FBI. Comey hired a law professor and friend, Daniel Richman, as a special government employee who worked on multiple projects for Comey, among them, interacting occasionally with reporters on sensitive investigations.",
      "Patel's immediate predecessor as FBI director, Christopher Wray, was so reticent about putting himself in the spotlight that agents often grumbled that he wasn't aggressive enough in defending the bureau. One close adviser alleged that he regularly admonished agents, \"Be a workhorse, not a show horse.\"",
      "Knight, in an interview, said the FBI's more aggressive public PR strategy aligns with Patel's avowed efforts to be a disruptor at the hidebound agency.",
      "\"Kash and [co-Deputy Director] Dan [Bongiono] were not hired to do business as usual,\" Knight said in an interview. \"They wanted to change the way things were done, help make the American people safe, and restore trust in the FBI. I don't think you can do that without communicating.\"",
      "Those who have interacted with her say Knight is skilled at cultivating relationships with reporters covering Patel. She has a reputation for being responsive to their questions and providing accurate information, even as she pushes for more favorable coverage of Patel.",
      "Her close relationship and direct access to Patel allow her to channel his views or get his personal reaction to the stories they're working on. One reporter called her \"the Kash whisperer.\"",
      "Knight, according to sources familiar with her role, works with Williamson to draft statements under Patel's name, and his talking points for interviews and his posts on X, where he remains a prolific poster.",
      "Knight has represented other clients in the MAGA world, too.",
      "\"Erica is a powerhouse,\" said Alina Habba, who until recently had been serving as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, but stepped down after a federal appeals court ruled that she was unlawfully appointed. Habba hired Knight when she was serving as a private defense lawyer for Donald Trump. Even before Patel completes his first year in the job, supporters and critics say it is hard to dispute the notion that he has been a disruptor, for better or worse.",
      "Patel's supporters say he's dragging the FBI into a new media age, one dominated by social media. And for that, Erica Knight has been there for every step \u2014 and every social media post.",

    "summary": "A federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that sought to require members of Congress to submit requests a week before visiting ICE detention facilities.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that sought to require members of Congress to submit requests a week before visiting and inspecting Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the policy likely violated an appropriations law passed by Congress saying that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, cannot use funds to require lawmakers in Congress to \"provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility\" to conduct oversight.",
      "That DHS policy, announced in June, said members of Congress should file requests to inspect ICE facilities a minimum of seven days before making the visit, and that only Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could waive that requirement. Before that policy, ICE had historically allowed members of Congress to visit ICE facilities, without prior notice.",
      "\"Contrary to Defendants' suggestion, then, (appropriations law) does entitle Members of Congress to access ICE facilities without being subject to a notice requirement,\" Cobb wrote in her ruling Wednesday.",
      "The D.C.-based judge's order stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the groups Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight on behalf of a dozen Democratic lawmakers in Congress who attempted to inspect ICE detention centers.",
      "In a statement, New York Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said Wednesday's order vindicated lawmakers' \"statutory right to conduct oversight.\"",
      "\"For months, masked, unidentified ICE agents have detained law-abiding immigrants in inhumane and unconstitutional conditions, while DHS has repeatedly and unlawfully blocked me and other Members of Congress from inspecting these facilities,\" Goldman said.",
      "The Trump administration has argued ICE detention site visits by members of Congress should not interfere with President Trump's constitutional powers. It has also accused Democratic lawmakers of going to ICE facilities for political purposes.",
      "DHS said in a Thursday statement: \"In Fiscal Year 2025, we supported more facility visits than any year under the Biden-Harris administration. These requests must be part of legitimate congressional oversight activities, and far too often they are just for a media act. Without proper support, such visits threaten the safety of ICE personnel, the detainees, and Members of Congress alike.\"",
      "The Justice Department charged Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey with assaulting law enforcement during a clash at an ICE detention facility in Newark. McIver has called the charges politically motivated.",
      "Wednesday's order also suspended a Trump administration policy that argued ICE field offices were not detention centers and thus not subject to unfettered congressional oversight. Democratic lawmakers have argued those facilities, even though they're not long-term detention centers, should be subject to inspections since they have been used to hold detainees for days in some cities, including in New York.",
      "The ruling comes amid a historic expansion of ICE's detention system under the second Trump administration.",
      "As of Nov. 30, ICE was holding roughly 66,000 individuals facing deportation in detention centers across the U.S., an all-time high, according to agency figures. Roughly 47% of those detainees lacked criminal records and were being held solely due to civil violations of immigration law. Some 26% of the detainees had criminal convictions and the other 26% had pending charges, the statistics show.",

    "summary": "North Carolina was among the GOP-led states this year that redrew congressional lines mid-decade in an attempt to benefit Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina Republicans redrew the state's congressional maps this fall, in the hopes of improving their chances at ousting a Democrat in one of the country's most competitive districts.",
      "In doing so, they may have created a window for a Democrat to make what has been a reliably Republican neighboring seat more competitive.",
      "CBS News has learned that Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran, plans to file Thursday for North Carolina's third congressional district seat. The race in the South could become a key contest in Democrats' quest to win back a majority next fall in the U.S. House.",
      "\"I'm running for Congress because the people of North Carolina's 3rd congressional district deserve someone who will show up and fight for them,\" Jaslow said in a campaign statement.",
      "GOP Rep. Greg Murphy has held the seat since a summer 2019 special election, and won another term in the 2024 election with more than 77% of the vote.",
      "But the physician's political future became a bit more muddled this fall, after Republican legislators in Raleigh changed the boundaries of his seat in an attempt to make the Democratic-held 1st Congressional District more favorable to Republicans. In part, the new map transferred a large swath of the eastern portion of Murphy's 3rd Congressional District to the 1st District, which is held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis.",
      "GOP leaders made the move as similar efforts played out around the country to try to protect the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House.",
      "Murphy announced afterwards that he would run for another term in Congress and was soon endorsed by President Trump.",
      "\"I am very excited about serving my old friends again in Greene, Lenoir and eastern Wayne while looking forward to new friendships in western Wayne and Wilson County,\" Murphy said in a statement at the time. \"These new counties will further strengthen my commitment to our beloved veterans and active-duty military, local manufacturing interests as well as North Carolina's cherished and vital agricultural economy.\"",
      "While the 1st and 3rd Districts are both still viewed as Republican-leaning areas, the impact brought about by redistricting isn't without political risk for conservatives.",
      "Murphy's district is now 43% Democratic, up from 39% Democratic before it was redrawn, whereas Davis' seat went from being 48% to 44% Democratic, according to a CBS News analysis of 2024 presidential election data.",
      "Mr. Trump has won North Carolina in the last three presidential elections, though each of the races in the state has been close. He has offered his support to Murphy.",
      "\"Greg knows the Wisdom and Courage required to Defend our Country, Support our Brave Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,\" Trump said in an October social media post.",
      "Hefty political spending is already expected to head to the state for next year's midterms, where former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper represents his party's best chance at winning back a GOP-held seat in the Senate. To have a reasonable shot at defeating Murphy, Democrats will likely need plenty to break their way, along with the typical political gravity of an incumbent president's party struggling in the midterms.",
      "Jaslow also brings a notable biography to the contest. After the 2018 midterms, Jaslow worked as the executive director of House Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to her Linkedin page. Her departure, along with several other staffers, became public in July 2019 during concerns over a lack of diversity at the party organization, according to earlier CBS News reporting.",
      "Until earlier this year, she had worked as the CEO of The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. In announcing her departure, a news release described her as having \"made history in 2023 as the first woman and first openly gay veteran to lead a major veterans service organization.\"",
      "As of Thursday, she does not live in the district, but is expected to soon.",
      "And in opening her campaign, Jaslow made clear what kind of focus she plans to take against the Republican incumbent within this newly shaped North Carolina district.",
      "\"As an American who has dedicated my life to serving my country, first in uniform and with the responsibility of leading soldiers in wartime, I'm furious that Greg Murphy seems to believe that public service is about serving himself and his friends and not his constituents,\" Jaslow said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The proposals run counter to the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday unveiled a series of regulatory actions designed to effectively ban gender-affirming care for minors, building on broader Trump administration restrictions on transgender Americans.",
      "The sweeping proposals include cutting off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from being used to fund such procedures.",
      "\"This is not medicine, it is malpractice,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of gender-affirming procedures on children in a news conference on Thursday. \"Sex-rejecting procedures rob children of their futures.\"",
      "Thursday's announcements mark the most significant moves the administration has taken to restrict the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical interventions for transgender children. They would imperil access in nearly two dozen states where drug treatments and surgical procedures remain legal and funded by Medicaid, which includes federal and state dollars.",
      "The proposals run counter to the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations. And advocates for transgender children strongly refuted the administration's claims about gender-affirming care and said Thursday's moves would put lives at risk.",
      "\"The multitude of efforts we are seeing from federal legislators to strip transgender and nonbinary youth of the health care they need is deeply troubling,\" said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, of The Trevor Project, a nonprofit suicide prevention organization for LBGTQ+ youth, who called the changes a \"one-size-fits-all mandate from the federal government\" on a decision that should be between a doctor and patient.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care.",
      "The Supreme Court's recent decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. Tennessee's law, known as SB1, prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. As CBS News previously reported, Tennessee argued that it had a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "The proposals announced by Kennedy and his deputies are not final or legally binding. The federal government must go through a lengthy rulemaking process, including periods of public comment and document rewrites, before the restrictions becoming permanent. They are also likely to face legal challenges.",
      "But the proposed rules will likely further intimidate health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children and many hospitals have already ceased such care in anticipation of federal action.",
      "Nearly all U.S. hospitals participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the federal government's largest health plans that cover seniors, people with disabilities and low-income Americans. Losing access to those payments would imperil most U.S. hospitals and medical providers.",
      "The same funding restrictions would apply to a smaller health program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, when it comes to care for people under the age of 19, according to a federal notice posted Thursday morning.",
      "Kennedy also announced Thursday that the HHS Office of Civil Rights will propose a rule excluding gender dysphoria from the definition of a disability.",
      "In a related move, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to a dozen companies that market chest-binding vests and other equipment used by people with gender dysphoria. Manufacturers include GenderBender LLC of Carson, California and TomboyX of Seattle. The FDA letters state that chest binders can only be legally marketed for FDA-approved medical uses, such as recovery after mastectomy surgery.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Thursday called transgender treatments \"a Band-Aid on a much deeper pathology,\" and suggested children with gender dysphoria are \"confused, lost and need help.\"",
      "Polling shows many Americans agree with the administration's view of the issue. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling transgender issues.",
      "Chloe Cole, a conservative activist known for speaking about her gender-transition reversal, spoke at the news conference to express appreciation. She said cries for help from her and others in her situation, \"have finally been heard.\"",
      "But the approach contradicts the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to restrict care for gender dysphoria.",
      "\"In an effort to strongarm hospitals into participating in the administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda, the Trump Administration is forcing health care systems to choose between providing lifesaving care for LGBTQ+ young people and accepting crucial federal funding,\" Dr. Jamila Perritt, a Washington-based OB/GYN and president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said in a statement.",
      "\"This is a lose-lose situation where lives are inevitably on the line. \"",
      "The announcements build on a wave of actions President Trump, his administration and Republicans in Congress have taken to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that declared the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. He also has signed orders aimed at cutting off federal support for gender transitions for people under age 19 and barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "On Wednesday, a bill that would open transgender health care providers to prison time if they treat people under the age of 18 passed the U.S. House and heads to the Senate. Another bill under consideration in the House on Thursday aims to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for children.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive hormone-blocking drugs that delay puberty, followed by testosterone or estrogen to bring about the desired physical changes in patients. Surgery is rare for minors.",

    "story": [
      "A Kremlin envoy will travel to Florida to discuss a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official said Thursday, as European Union leaders weighed a major loan to help the Ukrainian government.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is set to meet with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday, according to an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that hasn't yet been publicly announced.",
      "The official said that Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week, in which they discussed U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan aimed at ending the war.",
      "Asked about the meeting in Miami, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow was preparing for contacts with the U.S. to learn about the results of the meetings in Berlin, but didn't give further details.",
      "Witkoff will also meet Friday in Miami with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss the next phase of the Gaza deal, a senior State Department official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The first phase of the Gaza peace plan began on Oct. 10, halting fighting and exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month he planned to meet with Mr. Trump soon to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, 2022, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin's demands in peace talks.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured yet.",
      "The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a \"legitimate target.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the trans-Atlantic alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "At the same time, Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow's demands that it pull back its troops from other areas that Russia hasn't been able to take by force.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian officials were expected to hold negotiations in the U.S. on Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"We have progress in our dialogue with the American side regarding some of our points, they also speak with Russian side,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Brussels where EU leaders were set to decide whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine's military and financial needs over the next two years.",
      "\"We are in the war and United States are decision-makers, who can really stop Putin and I count on this,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I really count on pressure from United States. Putin does not want to stop this war, but he can if United States will pressure more.\"",
      "As European allies gathered for the high-stakes summit, Russia and Ukraine exchanged more aerial attacks.",
      "Ukraine's air force said that Russia fired 82 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight, 63 of which were intercepted or jammed.",
      "In Cherkasy, Russian drones that targeted critical infrastructure wounded six people and left parts of the city without electricity, regional administration head Ihor Taburets said. Russian drones also wounded four people in Kryvyi Rih and seven near Odesa, according to local officials.",
      "In Russia's Rostov region, three people were killed by Ukrainian drones overnight, including two crew members of a cargo ship that was hit in Rostov-on-Don and another man who died in Bataysk. At least 10 others were wounded, according to local officials.",

    "summary": "Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, saying \"the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.\"",
      "Smith was subpoenaed to testify earlier this month by the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel during the Biden administration. The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of Mr. Trump led by Smith.",
      "\"Any objective person who listened today to the deposition would know without any doubt that Jack Smith's investigation is based purely on the facts and the law and the evidence, nothing more and nothing less, and that's what you would expect of Jack, a career public servant who has served this nation for over 30 years as a public servant committed to the rule of law,\" Lanny Breuer, a lawyer for Smith, told reporters after the deposition.",
      "Following the question-and-answer session, Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Panel, said Smith answered every question to \"the satisfaction of any reasonable minded person in that room.\"",
      "Smith \"spent several hours schooling the Judiciary Committee on the professional responsibilities of a prosecutor and the ethical duties of a prosecutor,\" Raskin said. \"And he's a sensational and honorable public servant, and we are lucky to have him in the bar in the United States.\"",
      "Rep. Daniel Goldman, a Democrat from New York, criticized Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jim Jordan for having Smith testify behind closed doors first. Previous special counsels, including Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have appeared before lawmakers for public hearings. Mueller investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Hur probed former President Joe Biden's handling of sensitive government documents.",
      "\"The accusations against him are complete bogus, and the American people should hear that for themselves,\" he said.",
      "The president was indicted on more than 40 federal charges in two separate cases. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The president has denied wrongdoing and claimed Smith's investigations were politically motivated \"witch hunts\" that intended to harm his candidacy for the White House.",
      "Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "In portions of Smith's opening statement to the committee obtained by CBS News, the former special counsel defended his prosecutorial record and told lawmakers that he made decisions in the investigations \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "\"The decision to bring charges against President Trump was mine, but the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions, as alleged in the indictments returned by grand juries in two different districts,\" Smith told lawmakers.",
      "He continued: \"Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "Smith said the documents investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, Smith said, \"then repeatedly tried to obstruct justice to conceal his continued retention of those documents.\"",
      "In other portions of his opening statement, Smith defended investigative steps taken by his team, including obtaining phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers as part of the 2020 election probe. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, published a document in October alleging that the FBI obtained phone data from eight GOP senators and one Republican House member as part of the probe.",
      "The records, Smith said, \"were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation.\"",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith said. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "Breuer, one of the attorneys who represents the former special counsel, told reporters before the deposition that Smith \"is showing tremendous courage in light of the remarkable and unprecedented retribution campaign against him by this administration and this White House.\"",
      "Smith is also under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position as special counsel. His lawyers called the ethics probe by the Office of the Special Counsel \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",
      "Jaala  Brown, \n                                                  \n                                  Patrick  Maguire and \n                                                  \n                                  Melissa  Quinn\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Every night, Abdullah Ibrahim retreats from the streets into a wooded stretch along the Potomac River.",
      "As night falls and temperatures drop, he erects a tent and builds a fire beneath a canopy of pine, hemlock, and cedar trees.",
      "He evades authorities by rotating use of three tents of different colors at three campsites. As day breaks, he dismantles his shelter, rolls up his belongings, and hides them for the next night. \"They don't see you if you're in the woods,\" the 32-year-old said. \"But make sure it's broken down by morning or they'll find you.\"",
      "During the day, he wanders, stopping at a public library to warm up or a soup kitchen to eat. What's important is to not draw attention to himself for being homeless.",
      "\"Police want us out of the way,\" he said, dressed in a gray jacket and carrying none of his possessions. \"Out of sight, out of mind.\"",
      "Ibrahim has been deliberate about blending in since August, when President Trump placed the district's police under federal control and ordered National Guard soldiers to patrol its streets. The president also ordered homeless people to leave immediately. \"There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY,'\" he posted.",
      "The Trump administration says encampment sweeps have reduced the visibility of homelessness, thereby enhancing the city. \"There is no disputing that Washington, DC is a safer, cleaner, and more beautiful city thanks to President Trump's historic actions to restore the nation's capital,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.",
      "While there may appear to be fewer homeless people in the nation's capital now, they have not disappeared.",
      "In interviews, homeless people said they are in a constant shuffle, hiding in plain sight. During the day, they stay on the move, grabbing meals at soup kitchens and resting on occasion in public libraries, on park benches, or at bus stops. At night, many unsheltered people bed down in business doorways, on park sidewalks, and on church stoops. Some ride the bus all night, while a few shelter in emergency rooms. Others find respite in the woods or flee to suburbs in Virginia or Maryland.",
      "There are about 5,100 homeless people in Washington, D.C., including in temporary shelters, according to an early-2025 homelessness tally. After Mr. Trump ordered the crackdown on public homelessness, people living in makeshift communities scattered and are now living in the shadows. City officials estimated in August that nearly 700 homeless people were living outdoors without tents or other shelter.",
      "As winter draws near, they are exposed to the elements and grow sicker as chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease go untreated. Street medicine providers say that, since the National Guard was deployed, they have faced enormous difficulty finding patients. Many caught up in sweeps have had their lifesaving medications thrown away, and they are more likely to miss medical appointments because they are constantly on the move. Street medicine providers say they can't find their patients to deliver medication or transport them to medical appointments. The constant chaos can suck patients with mental illness and substance use deeper into drug and alcohol addiction, raising the risk of overdose.",
      "Caseworkers report similar disruptions, saying as clients get lost, they break connections essential for obtaining housing documents, particularly IDs and Social Security cards.",
      "District officials and health providers say this cascade will make homelessness worse, threatening public health and public safety and racking up enormous costs for the health care system.",
      "\"It was already hard locating people, but the federal presence just made it worse,\" said Tobie Smith, a street medicine doctor and the executive director of Street Health D.C.",
      "The homeless shuffle",
      "Chris Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but now is homeless, having been pushed out of his tent near the White House in the initial days of the federal homelessness crackdown. He said two of his tents were taken during sweeps. Now, sleeping on a sidewalk outside a church, he doesn't bother trying to get another one. \"Why? What's the point? It'll just get thrown away again.\"",
      "Jones, 57, has a severe knee injury that prevents him from walking some days and said he was scheduled for a knee replacement in December. He said it's important to stay where he is \u2014 he relies on a nearby drugstore to refill his medications for bipolar disorder, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When he's hungry, he goes to a soup kitchen for a meal or tries to get a cheeseburger and a soda from a fast-food joint across the street.",
      "It's important for him to stay outside the church, he said, so his case manager can find him when a permanent housing slot opens up. If it gets too cold, he said, he will cross the street and sleep in the doorway of a business, which can provide a bit more shelter. He wants to get indoors, but for now, he waits.",
      "Since taking control of Washington's police force, the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on cities and counties across the nation to clear homeless encampments under threat of arrest, citation, or detention. It has ordered or threatened similar National Guard deployments in Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and other cities with large homeless populations.",
      "Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said the president is maintaining National Guard and federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital \"to ensure the long-term success of the federal operation.\" Since March, city and federal officials have removed more than 130 homeless encampments, she said, though some local homelessness experts say that number could be inflated.",
      "The Supreme Court last year made it easier for elected officials and law enforcement to fine or arrest homeless people for living outside. Then, in July of this year, the president issued an executive order calling for a nationwide crackdown on urban camping, including a massive removal of people living outdoors and forced mental health or substance use treatment.",
      "President Trump is also spearheading an overhaul of homelessness policy, moving to slash funding for permanent housing and services for homeless people. The move would limit the use of a long-standing federal policy known as \"Housing First\" that offers housing without mandating mental health or addiction treatment. The National Alliance to End Homelessness warns the move risks displacing at least 170,000 people in permanent supportive housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development paused the plan on Dec. 8 to make revisions, which it \"intends\" to do, federal housing officials said.",
      "City officials say they are complying with the Trump administration's forceful campaign against homeless people sheltering outside. Pressured by the White House, local officials said they've gotten more aggressive in breaking up camps. Advocates for homeless people say some of the sweeps have been conducted at night and others with little or no notice to move. City leaders believe they could be done more compassionately by offering services and shelter.",
      "\"We've pivoted from the notion of allowing encampments if they didn't violate public health or safety to a position of, 'We don't want you in the streets,'\" said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for District of Columbia Health and Human Services, who oversees encampment cleanups. \"It's unsafe, it's unhealthy, and it's dangerous.\" Yet he acknowledges the encampment sweeps can waste city resources as caseworkers and street medicine providers scramble to find their clients and patients.",
      "Advocates say the Trump administration is inciting fear and mistrust between homeless people and those working to help them while wasting taxpayer dollars used to provide care and place people into housing. There are, however, far fewer tents and large-scale encampments visible to tourists and residents.",
      "\"People found safety in those communities and service providers could find them. Now there are people with guns and flashing lights dislocating folks experiencing homelessness without notice and just throwing stuff away,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center.",
      "District officials say some people have accepted emergency shelter. But even as the city works to connect people with services and expand shelter capacity, officials acknowledge there isn't enough permanent housing or temporary beds for everyone.",
      "And there will be fewer places for people living outside to go.",
      "The city, in its fiscal year 2026 budget, concentrated its homelessness funding on families, funding 336 new permanent supportive housing vouchers. Yet it cut funding for temporary housing for both families and individuals and provided no new permanent supportive housing vouchers for individuals. That means fewer housing slots for single adults, who make up most of those wandering the streets. City officials said, however, that they have slotted 260 more permanent housing units for homeless individuals or families into their construction pipeline.",
      "Worsening health care",
      "The fallout is inundating local soup kitchens with demand, including Miriam's Kitchen in Foggy Bottom. The local institution provides hot meals, housing assistance, and warm blankets to people in need.",
      "Caseworkers say it's becoming increasingly difficult to help clients secure IDs and other documents needed for housing and other social services.",
      "\"I'm looking everywhere, but I can't find people,\" said Cyria Knight, a case worker at Miriam's Kitchen. \"Most of my clients went to Virginia.\"",
      "It's unclear how much of the district's homeless population has fanned out to neighboring Virginia and Maryland communities. There were an estimated 9,700 homeless people in the region in January, months before the Trump crackdown. Four of six counties around Washington saw homelessness rise from 2024, while it fell 9% in the district.",
      "\"I'm not seeing my patients for a month or more, and then when I do, their chronic conditions are uncontrolled. They've been in and out of the ER, and they're more likely to be hospitalized,\" said Anna Graham, a street medicine nurse practitioner for Unity Health Care, a network of clinics in Washington. \"It's just setting us back.\"",
      "Graham's team stations its mobile medical van outside Miriam's Kitchen at dinnertime to better find patients.",
      "Willie Taylor, 63, was figuring out where to sleep for the night after grabbing dinner from Miriam's. He saw Graham to receive his medications for advanced lung disease, seizures, chronic pain, and other health disorders.",
      "He has difficulty walking and needs a wheelchair, which is complicated because he doesn't have a permanent address. Taylor and his medical providers say his previous wheelchairs have been stolen while he slept outdoors at night. He uses a shopping cart to keep him steady, walking around all day, until nightfall.",
      "On a cold November night, Graham helped Taylor figure out his daily medications and checked his vitals. The team handed him a warm coat and hand warmers before sending him back outside.",
      "After walking for about 45 minutes, he found a piece of park pavement where he could build a bed out of tarps and sleeping bags.",
      "\"My body can't take this,\" Taylor said, preparing to sleep. \"There's ice on the concrete. I'm in so much pain; it hurts so much worse when it's cold.\"",
      "Homeless people die younger and cost the health care system more than housed people, largely because conditions go untreated on the streets, and when they do seek care, many go to the ER. Among Medicaid enrollees, homeless people have been estimated to incur $18,764 a year in spending, compared with $7,561 for other enrollees.",
      "Over at the So Others Might Eat soup kitchen earlier that day, Tyree Kelley was finishing his breakfast of a sausage sandwich and hard-boiled eggs. He was considering going into a shelter. The streets were becoming too dangerous for someone like him, he said, referring to the police and National Guard presence. He was feeling the loss of an encampment community that would watch his back.",
      "He's been to the ER at least seven times this year to get care for a broken ankle he sustained falling off an electric scooter. The accident caused him to lose his job and health insurance as a garbageman, he said. His situation has caused him to sink deeper into a depression that began three years ago after his mother died, he said.",
      "Then his father and sister died this year. He began to numb his pain with beer.",
      "\"You get so depressed, being out here,\" said Kelley, 42. \"It gets addictive. You start to not care about even changing your clothes.\"",
      "His depression also led him to seek out marijuana. Then he smoked a joint laced with fentanyl. The overdose sent him to the hospital for days.",
      "\"I actually died and came back,\" he said, crediting other homeless people with administering naloxone and saving his life. \"I need to get out of this, but I feel so stuck.\"",
      "A few blocks west of the White House sits a vacant plot of land that earlier this year held more than a dozen tents. Workers in the area sense what they don't always see.",
      "\"I was here when this was all cleared. A bulldozer came in, and all their stuff was thrown in a garbage truck,\" said Ray Szemborski, who works across the street from the now-empty lot. \"People are still homeless. I still see them around underneath the bridge. Sometimes they're at bus stops, sometimes just walking around. Their tents are gone but they're still here.\"",

      "From \"Sleepy Joe\" Biden references to painting Republican icon Ronald Reagan as a fan of a young Mr. Trump, the plaques include language written in Trumpian style.

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department is suing more than a dozen landlords on allegations of sexual harassment, a problem one top department official called \"traumatic for the victims\" and \"inappropriate and illegal.\"",
    "story": [
      "In a crowded neighborhood of duplexes, small apartments and one-story bungalows near a liquor store and pizza shop, William Asper serves as a landlord for nearly two dozen properties.",
      "The Detroit suburb of Westland, Michigan, 10 minutes north of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, is where Asper helps manage some weathered rental properties, many of which were built in the early 1970s and are more affordable to low-income families in this working-class region, according to federal records published by the Justice Department.",
      "Amid surging housing costs, rent in the neighborhood is more affordable, including for families who use federal subsidies and have no other options for housing.",
      "The Justice Department has alleged Asper tried to take advantage of the needs of his tenants, leveraging his position to seek sexual favors. The agency said Asper threatened to withhold repairs or evict tenants who did not comply.",
      "In a court filing in Michigan earlier this month, the Justice Department alleged Asper told one tenant in 2019 \"that there were 'different ways' she could pay rent.\" The government's attorneys also said he \"touched the tenant without her consent, regularly pulling her hair, grabbing her buttocks and kissing her head.\" And they alleged he \"regularly pulled his penis out of his pants in front of the tenant while at her home, often times while her young son was in the room.\"",
      "In their court documents, Justice Department lawyers also alleged that in 2018, Asper told a \"female tenant that he was lonely, wanted someone to spend time with him, and asked if she would go to a hotel with him. Asper allegedly \"told the female tenant that if she did not engage in sexual relations with him, he would give her a 24-hour eviction notice.\"",
      "The allegations appeared in a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Asper, arguing he violated the federal Fair Housing Act. His civil case is pending in the Eastern District of Michigan federal court, and his formal response to the allegations has not yet been posted.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Asper said the accusations are false.",
      "\"I offer low-income housing and people want to blame the landlord or make excuses why they couldn't pay the rent,\" Asper said. \"These women wanted to do more/be my 'girlfriend', side chick and that was not going to happen.\"",
      "Asper isn't the only landlord facing such claims. It is one of at least 52 federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and misconduct against landlords since 2017.",
      "\"It's traumatic for the victims,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. \"People may not believe them. And they may have been the victim multiple times.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which seeks to combat these types of cases, was launched in the first year of the first Trump administration in 2017. Dhillon's team continues to pursue the cases. Several former Justice Department attorneys, including appointees of both the Biden and Trump Administrations, have lauded the program and its work since 2017.",
      "There are 14 federal sexual harassment civil cases pending across the United States, including Asper's case in Michigan.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Dhillon said the filings of these suits can serve as a deterrent to future harassment and abuse. She said the legal challenges \"made all the women in that property feel like they've been seen and heard.\"",
      "Dhillon said the Fair Housing Act, which passed in 1968 amid the sweeping changes of the Civil Rights era, prohibits any kind of quid pro quo involving sex, sexual acts or sexual harassment, either for renting, continuing to rent or obtaining repairs.",
      "\"Every American deserves to feel safe and know this sexual harassment is inappropriate and illegal,\" Dhillon said.",
      "A CBS News review of some of the dozens of recently filed Justice Department cases shows parallels to the accusations against Asper.",
      "In a separate legal challenge filed against a central New York landlord in 2018, the Justice Department alleged the harassment spanned three decades. The Oswego man is accused of \"Demanding that female tenants engage in, or pressuring them to engage in, sexual intercourse, oral sex, or other sexual acts with him in order to obtain or keep rental housing.\"",
      "In a 2017 Justice Department complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, a Wichita-area landlord is accused of entering a female tenant's apartment \"unannounced\" and \"touching her body while she slept in her bed.\" The landlord is also accused of \"Conditioning tangible housing benefits, including forgiving or reducing rent, on engaging in sexual conduct.\"",
      "And in a legal challenge initially filed in Minnesota in 2020, the feds alleged a landlord offered to overlook or excuse unpaid rent and utilities in exchange for sex acts. The landlord was also accused of \"Expressing a preference for renting to single female tenants.\"",
      "The legal challenges filed by the Justice Department can help secure civil penalties against landlords and damages for victims. A CBS News review of Justice Department records showed the agency has recovered approximately $1.5 million since January.",
      "And in the New York, Kansas and Minnesota cases, the Justice Department struck written agreements with the landlords that, among other things, required them to hire independent property managers so they would no longer need to come into contact with tenants themselves.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Fair Housing Alliance, a civil rights group that advocates for tenants and combats discrimination, said instances of sexual harassment by landlords are likely more pervasive than current statistics indicate.",
      "\"Sexual harassment in housing is one of the most underreported instances of housing discrimination, given that the victims often fear facing retaliation or eviction if they file a complaint,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which handles Fair Housing Act sex harassment probes, has experienced a purge of veteran employees this year, amid a Trump-ordered downsizing of the federal government \u2014 led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 and the Trump Administration's dramatic shifts in some of the office's priorities.",
      "Justice Connection, a newly formed organization that supports ousted or resigning Justice Department prosecutors, estimated nearly 75% of career attorneys in the division have departed this year.",
      "Dhillon said the unit that handles the housing cases has been less impacted by the changes and cuts. She told CBS News, \"I don't think we're losing people in that section, and people are pretty happy with the type of work we're doing.\" Dhillon said the Civil Rights section has hired approximately 50 people this year, amid the larger turnover in the agency.",
      "Some tenants have filed their own individual federal civil lawsuits alleging sex harassment in violation of the Fair Housing Act.",
      "In one case, an Alabama woman filed a complaint in federal court alleging a series of personal harms. Her suit alleged \"emotional distress, including humiliation and mental anguish\" from a landlord who \"offered to reduce her rent in exchange for sex.\" The lawsuit alleged: \"When [she] refused his sexual advances, he raised her rent.\"",
      "Housing advocates said low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to harassment, under fear that they could lose their housing if they reject a landlord's unlawful advances.",
      "The Justice Department's posted guidance on its protections of the Fair Housing Act says that \"women, particularly those who are poor, and with limited housing options, often have little recourse but to tolerate the humiliation and degradation of sexual harassment or risk having their families and themselves removed from their homes. The Department's enforcement program is aimed at landlords who create an untenable living environment by demanding sexual favors from tenants or by creating a sexually hostile environment for them.\"",
      "The National Fair Housing Alliance spokesperson told CBS News: \"Each investigation\u2014and especially every resolution\u2014sends a clear message that this egregious conduct, which targets the most vulnerable, will not be tolerated. Home should be a safe place, and these actions ensure that promise is upheld.\"",
      "Justice Connection, an organization of former Justice Department employees, told CBS News it estimates the agency's housing unit has lost nearly half of its staff this year.",

      "The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), established in 1960 as a federally funded research and education hub in Boulder, Colorado, will be broken up, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said on social media.",
      "Any of its operations deemed \"vital,\" such as weather research, will be moved \"to another entity or location,\" he said.",
      "\"This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,\" Vought said.",

      "The plan was first\u00a0reported\u00a0by USA Today. It said moves to dismantle NCAR will begin immediately.",
      "Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished NCAR scholar,\u00a0told The Washington Post breaking up the laboratory would result in a major loss of scientific research.",
      "Trenberth, an honorary academic in physics at New Zealand's University of Auckland, said the center was crucial to the search for advanced climate science discoveries.",
      "Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which oversees NCAR, told the Post that, \"Any plans to dismantle NSF NCAR would set back our nation's ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to severe weather and other natural disasters.\"",
      "The White House noted that NCAR's budget\u00a0more than doubled\u00a0from the 1980s to the 1990s and called it \"the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy,\" pointing to examples of its research on wind turbines and air pollution.",
      "Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement on Tuesday that he hadn't been briefed on the plans by White House officials, but said, \"If true, public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dinosaur-tracks-found-italian-alps-region-winter-olympics/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that 10 of its retail partners are testing that approach to pricing, describing such practices as a standard way stores assess customer preferences.",

      "One day after retired NASCAR driver Greg Biffle and his family died in a private plane crash in North Carolina, his mother in-law said the family doesn't know how they're going to fill the \"huge hole\" left behind.",
      "Biffle, his wife, Christina Grossu Biffle, their son Ryder and Biffle's daughter Emma were among the seven people killed when a Cessna C550 crashed while landing at Statesville Regional Airport in North Carolina on Friday morning. The other three people aboard the flight were identified as Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton.",
      "Cathy Grossu said she and her daughter were texting \"all day long,\" including during the flight.",
      "\"Then she said something like 'We're in trouble, emergency landing.' And I texted back, 'What's wrong with the plane?'\" Grossu told CBS News. \"Then the next thing was (the SOS alert) that you get from your automatic Apple phones when you have an accident or something. And so I knew that something was wrong.\"",
      "Grossu called the airport. She said she was told there was a fire.",
      "\"That's when we knew that they crashed,\" Grossu said.",
      "A\u00a0picture of the plane\u00a0shows the craft engulfed in flames. Debris fell along a nearby golf course, witnesses said.",
      "A flight path available on the tracking website FlightAware appears to show that the plane departed, then looped back towards the airport. North Carolina State Highway Patrol confirmed that the plane had departed and was returning to the airport on reapproach, but did not say why. The cause of the crash has not been determined.",
      "Grossu said she had last seen the family on the day before the crash, but didn't remember what her final words to them had been.",
      "\"It's a cliche, people say to say 'I love you' to your loved ones all the time, and to embrace them and everything else. And that's the other regret I have, is I know when we said goodbye on Wednesday, we hugged. I don't know what my last words were,\" Grossu said, through tears. \"Maybe it was 'I love you.' I don't know. I don't remember.\"",
      "Grossu remembered the family as \"good people\" who \"lived life to the fullest.\"",
      "\"It was way too soon for all of them to lose their lives, but they didn't hold back and they were always giving,\" Grossu said.",
      "Grossu said 14-year-old Emma, whom Biffle shared with her mother Nicole Lunders, was a \"good girl.\" Ryder, 5, was a \"bundle of energy\" who called his grandparents Mimi and Baba. He was at Grossu's house all the time, she said. He dreamed of being an F1 driver.",
      "\"All of his presents under the tree were in that regard. And he asked me on Wednesday, he said, 'Mimi, can I open up one of my presents?' And I said 'No, you gotta wait till Christmas,'\" Grossu said. \"And I regret that, saying that, every hour since this happened, why I didn't let him open one present. I didn't, and I feel so badly about that.\"",
      "Tributes from the racing community and beyond have been pouring in since the family's deaths were confirmed. NASCAR remembered Biffle as \"more than a champion driver\" and a \"friend to so many.\" North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson wrote on X that Biffle was a \"great NASCAR champion\" and \"extraordinary person as well.\" A family statement called Biffle and his wife, devoted parents who built their lives around their children. The statement also said Dennis Dutton and his son, Jack, were \"deeply loved\" and that Craig Wadsworth was \"beloved by many\" in the NASCAR community.",
      "\"It's hard. We're devastated,\" Grossu said.",
      "\"We're just taking it one minute at a time,\" Grossu continued. \"I can't talk about it without bawling. I try not to, but it's impossible.\"",

    "summary": "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits over allegations of poor care.",
    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",
      "DraftKings said its app, which is expected to be available in major app stores within days, will connect with multiple exchanges, starting with the derivatives marketplace CME Group.",
      "Once they have a DraftKings account, users can enter the DraftKings Predictions app and start trading by clicking on the yes/no questions associated with an event, such as an NFL game, and deciding how much money they want to wager.",

      "\"We're handling that order and it's getting sent to an exchange for it to be executed,\" she explained.",
      "DraftKings faces growing competition from prediction markets \u2014 including Kalshi and Polymarket, now valued at $9 billion and $11 billion, respectively \u2014 that enable users to speculate on the outcome of sports and other events.",
      "In October, DraftKings\u00a0announced\u00a0the acquisition of Railbird Technologies, a federally regulated prediction market. At the time, DraftKings said the deal supports its \"broader strategy to enter prediction markets.\"",
      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Providence, R.I. \u2014 Information from a tipster who had a strange encounter with another man on a sidewalk outside Brown University was key to police identifying the suspect they believe killed two students at the school and then two days later gunned down a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.",
      "Known only as \"John\" in a Providence police affidavit, the source is being hailed by investigators as the key figure who gave law enforcement the details needed to determine who was behind the Brown shooting, as well as the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who was shot in his Brookline home Monday.",
      "Ever since a shooter unloaded more than 40 rounds inside a Brown engineering building, anxiety and frustration has plagued the Providence, Rhode Island, community as police appeared no closer to identifying the person.",
      "Yet on the sixth day of the investigation, the case gathered steam, ending with police announcing late Thursday they had found the suspected gunman dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "The tipster, John, was the reason.",
      "\"He blew this case right open,\" said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha of the information provided by the individual that resulted in finding the gunman nearly 24 hours later.",
      "\"When you crack it, you crack it,\" he said.",
      "According to police, John had several encounters with 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente before Saturday's attack. As police posted images of a person of interest \u2014 now identified as Neves Valente \u2014 John began posting on the social media forum Reddit that he recognized the person and theorized that police should look into \"possibly a rental\" gray Nissan. Reddit users urged him to tell the FBI, and John said he did. The police affidavit said they learned about the tip on Dec. 16, three days after the shooting and a day after the tip line was created.",
      "Up until that point, the police affidavit says officials had not connected a vehicle to the possible shooter.",
      "That detail led them to get more video of a Nissan Sentra sedan with Florida plates and enabled Providence police officers to tap into a network of more than 70 street cameras operated around the city by surveillance company Flock Safety.",
      "The affidavit says John gave investigators additional critical details: He encountered Neves Valente in the bathroom of the engineering building just hours before the attack, where John noted the suspect's clothing was \"inappropriate and inadequate for the weather.\"",
      "During his police interview, John recognized photos of the suspect's car and then what John thought was probably the suspect from photos of him at an Alamo car rental in November, according to the affaidavit.",
      "John also bumped into Neves Valente outside, mere blocks from the building, where John watched Neves Valente \"suddenly\" turn around from the Nissan when he saw John. What ensued was then a \"game of cat and mouse,\" according to John's testimony - where the two would encounter each other and Neves Valente would run away.",
      "At one point, John says he yelled out \"Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?\"",
      "\"The Suspect responded, 'I don't know you from nobody,' then Suspect repeatedly asked, 'Why are you harassing me?'\" according to the affidavit.",
      "John told police he eventually saw Neves Valente approach the Nissan sedan once more and decided to walk away.",
      "\"Respectfully, I have said all I have to say on the matter to the right people,\" John wrote on Reddit Wednesday night.",
      "On Friday, the FBI would not reveal whether John will receive the $50,000 reward the bureau had offered for information about the Brown shooting.",
      "\"The FBI maintains longstanding policy not to confirm the identity of individuals who assist the FBI by providing tips or information,\" the bureau said in a statement to CBS News. \"Additionally, the FBI will not comment on whether reward money has been paid and to whom. The FBI takes this position for privacy protection, and to ensure the public's continued cooperation and incentivization with any future assistance. Receiving tips from the public remains one of the FBI's best tools in preventing, detecting, and deterring crime.\"",
      "On Thursday, Ted Docks, special agent in charge of the FBI, said it was possible when asked by reporters if John would receive the reward money.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted to rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "\"I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, confirmed the vote by the board to name the performing arts institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the Kennedy Center website had updated its logo to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to put his stamp\u00a0on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts soon after he returned to the White House for his second term. He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \"honored\" and \"surprised\" by the vote, and praised the board as \"very distinguished.\"",
      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and opened its doors in 1971. It recognizes achievements in music, theater and dance each year with its honors ceremony. The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, will\u00a0air on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",
      "Because the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, any change to its name would appear to require approval from lawmakers. Still, Mr. Trump from sought to unilaterally make sweeping changes to other federal entities that would require congressional action.",
      "The president in September signed an executive order to begin the process of renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The directive allowed the Pentagon to start using Department of War as a \"secondary title\" and let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title of secretary of war.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that sought to dismantle the Department of Education. Fully eliminating the agency would require an act of Congress.",

      "Fall of 2000 and spring of 2001",
      "Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa and began graduate school at Brown University, where he took physics classes at the Barus & Holley building. He took a leave of absence in April 2001 and formally withdrew from the school in July 2003.",

      "Friday, Nov. 28 (15 days before the shooting)",
      "A Brown University custodian spots a man in a surgical mask and the same clothes as the suspect, in the Barus & Holley building. The man walked into a bathroom, across from room 166, the auditorium where the shootings will eventually happen. The man was walking with a limp.",
      "Monday, Dec. 1 (12 days before the shooting)",
      "According to the affidavit, Valente rented a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida plates from an Alamo Rent-a-Car on Atlantic Avenue in Boston at 11:36 a.m. Foley said he then drove \"to the vicinity\" of Brown University.",
      "The Brown University custodian sees the same man again in Barus & Holley.",
      "Foley said Valente's rental car was \"observed intermittently\" between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 in the area of Brown University.",
      "Saturday, Dec. 13 \u2014 the day of the Brown University shooting",
      "At 10:35 a.m., the suspect is seen on surveillance video wearing a mask, walking at Manning and Cooke streets in Providence, about five minutes away from the Barus & Holley building at Brown University.",

      "At 2:16 p.m., he encountered another person, later identified by police as \"John,\" on George Street. Valente then ran away from John, who ran after him. The two are then seen again \"in close proximity.\"",

      "At 4:03 p.m., a camera on a Brown University shuttle bus showed him walking away from the Barus & Holley building.",
      "At 4:06 p.m., he is spotted briefly on surveillance video walking at the corner of Hope and Waterman streets. This short video was the first clip released to the public as the manhunt began.",
      "At 4:08 p.m., he is shown walking on Waterman Street.",

It was parked in front of the little shack behind the Rhode Island Historical Society on the Cooke St. side. I know because he used his key fob to open the car, approached it and then something prompted him to back away. When he backed away he relocked the car. I found that odd so when he circled the block I approached the car that is when I saw the Florida plates. He was parked in the section between the gate of the RIHS and the corner of Cooke and George St.\"",
      "Based on the tip, police took another look at surveillance video in the area and spotted the Nissan.",
      "Wednesday, Dec. 17",

      "Later Wednesday evening, the Reddit poster approached police at the Brown University Alumni Hall on Meeting Street and identified himself. \"John\" went to the police station with officers and agreed to a recorded interview.",
      "He said he first encountered the suspect in a bathroom at the Barus & Holley building between 1:45 and 2 p.m. on Dec. 13, about two hours before the shooting. He gave investigators an extremely detailed description of Valente and his clothes, which he described as \"inappropriate and inadequate for the weather.\" John said Valente left the building and went to the parking lot. He then followed Valente up Manning Street.",
      "John then went into further detail about the encounter described in his Reddit post and told officers the suspect would switch directions every time they saw each other, and that it turned into a \"game of cat and mouse\" between the two of them.",
      "At one point, on George Street, they got within two feet of each other.",
      "According to the affidavit, \"John asked the Suspect, 'Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?' The Suspect responded, 'I don't know you from nobody,' then Suspect repeatedly asked, 'Why are you harassing me?'\"",
      "John said he walked away and never saw the man again. Less than two hours later, the gunman opened fire on students in the Barus & Holley building.",
      "Police showed John two photos from a license-plate reader camera, known as Flock images, of the Nissan and he said \"Holy s---. That might be it.\"",
      "Police had obtained the images of the car after a Brown faculty member came to them on Dec. 17 about seeing a Nissan with Florida plates driving \"unusually slow\" in the area near campus on Thursday, Dec. 11 \u2014 two days before the shooting.",
      "Police searched Flock cameras around the east side of Providence and found 14 images of the Nissan dating as far back as Dec. 1.",
      "Investigators traced the car's license plate to the Alamo rental center in Boston and found it was rented by Valente. ATF agents went to the Alamo and started looking through their surveillance video. Video from Dec. 1 showed Valente.",
      "Police also found video of Valente at the Alamo as far back as Nov. 17.",

    "summary": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used by Brown University shooting suspect Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced late Thursday that the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used eight years ago by the now-deceased man accused of killing two Brown University students and an MIT professor.",
      "\"This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,\" Noem said on X. \"At President Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"",
      "Noem said the suspected shooter, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the United States through the program in 2017 and was issued a green card.",
      "What is the diversity visa program?",
      "Launched in the 1990s, the program offers 50,000 visas per year to people from countries with relatively low rates of immigration to the U.S., with recipients selected at random using a lottery. Every year, tens of millions of people vie for visas through the program.",
      "In order to qualify for a diversity visa, applicants must have at least a high school education or two years of work experience in a field that requires training. They are also required to undergo vetting and an interview before getting a visa.",
      "The program was created by Congress, and it's not clear under what legal mechanism Noem can order a pause. Most visas issued through the lottery are overseen by the State Department, though a small number are processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 which is part of DHS \u2014 for applicants already in the U.S.",
      "Criticism from Trump administration",
      "President Trump is a longstanding critic of the diversity visa lottery program, arguing it could pose security risks and isn't sufficiently merit-based, like employment-based visas. He pushed to end it early in his first term, after a man who had received a diversity visa killed eight people in a truck-ramming attack in New York City. Supporters of the visas say recipients are vetted and argue the program is good for the U.S. economy and the country's image abroad.",
      "The first Trump administration suspended the program in 2020, part of a\u00a0broader set of restrictions\u00a0on legal immigration that cited the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0reversed that policy\u00a0in 2021.",
      "Shooting suspect in the U.S.",
      "Neves Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, officials said in a press conference late Thursday.",
      "More than a decade before getting a diversity visa, Neves Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa in 2000 to attend graduate school at Brown University, according to a local police affidavit that was attached to his arrest warrant. Brown's president says he studied at the Ivy League school for a few months starting in the fall of 2000, but he took a leave of absence in the spring of 2001 and formally withdrew two years later.",
      "Authorities said Neves Valente was found dead by suicide in a storage unit in New Hampshire late Thursday, ending a days-long investigation following a shooting at Brown that killed two students and wounded nine over the weekend. Authorities say he is also believed to be responsible for the deadly shooting of an MIT professor in suburban Boston two days after the shooting at Brown.",

    "summary": "Jack Smith, who oversaw two investigations into President Trump, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for a closed-door deposition Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith reiterated their call for Smith to appear publicly before lawmakers to answer questions about his investigations into President Trump after he testified privately earlier in the week.",
      "Smith appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a closed-door deposition and answered questions for roughly nine hours, his lawyers, Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said in a letter to the panel's chairman, Jim Jordan, that was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Mr. Smith welcomed this opportunity and hopes that it will serve to correct the many mischaracterizations about the work of the Special Counsel's Office,\" they wrote in the letter, dated Thursday.",
      "Breuer and Koski urged Jordan, an Ohio Republican, to promptly release the full videotape of the deposition and said \"doing so will ensure that the American people can hear the facts directly from Mr. Smith, rather than through second-hand accounts.\" Koski and Breuer also reiterated their request for Smith to address lawmakers in an \"open and public hearing.\"",
      "\"During the investigation of President Trump, Mr. Smith steadfastly followed Justice Department policies, observed all legal requirements, and took actions based on the facts and the law. He stands by his decisions,\" they wrote to Jordan.",
      "Politico first reported the letter from Smith's lawyers to Jordan. Two former special counsels, Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have each testified in open forums about their respective investigations. Mueller\u00a0examined Russian interference\u00a0in the 2016 election, and Hur\u00a0probed former President Joe Biden's handling\u00a0of sensitive government documents.",
      "Smith was tapped as special counsel during the Biden administration to take over the Justice Department's investigations into Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents and his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Mr. Trump faced a total of more than 40 charges in both of those cases, though they ended after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Now, with Republicans in control of Congress, they have begun investigating the prosecutions. Smith had offered in October to voluntarily answer questions in an open hearing before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, but Jordan issued a subpoena to the former special counsel demanding Smith's testimony at a closed-door deposition.",
      "In his opening statement to lawmakers, which was obtained by CBS News, Smith defended the prosecutions of Mr. TRump and said he made decisions \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "He said his investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 election developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the president engaged in a scheme to overturn the results of the last presidential contest. As to the case involving the president's handling of documents marked classified, Smith told lawmakers that his investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Smith also defended investigative steps taken by his team, which included obtaining phone records of nine sitting GOP members of Congress as part of his probe related to the 2020 election. The data was for several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to keep Congress from certifying the election results.",
      "The former special counsel said the records were \"lawfully subpoenaed\" and relevant to his investigation.",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith told the Judiciary Committee. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "On his first day back in the White House, the president issued sweeping pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack.",

      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts posted a photo of Neves Valente on social media late Thursday night.",
      "He was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, Florida, officials said during a news conference Thursday night.",
      "He studied at Brown in 2000-2001 and then moved to the U.S. in 2017 after receiving a green card through a visa lottery program, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media post late Thursday.",
      "Where was the suspect found?",
      "Officials said Neves Valente died by suicide at a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, where he had rented a unit. A satchel and two firearms were found with him.",
      "\"We are 100% confident that this is our target, and that this case is closed from a perspective of pursuing people involved,\" Neronha said.",
      "But so far the motive remains a mystery.",
      "\"I don't think we have any idea why now, or why \u2014 why Brown? Why these students? Why this classroom? That is really unknown to us. It may become clear, I hope that it does, but it hasn't as of right now,\" Neronha said.",
      "How was the suspect identified?",
      "Security footage and hotel, rental car and storage unit records all helped in the case. And police said\u00a0information from a tipster who encountered the suspect near Brown University was key to making the identification.",
      "Leah Foley, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, provided a timeline at a news conference Thursday night.",
      "She said the suspect stayed in a hotel room in Boston in late November, and then on Dec. 1 he rented a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida plates from a car rental agency in Boston and drove \"to the vicinity\" of Brown University. Providence is about an hour's drive from Boston.",
      "His car was \"observed intermittently\" between Dec. 1 and Dec. 12 in the area of Brown University, Foley said. The shooting took place on Saturday, Dec. 13, and suspect then returned to Massachusetts, where MIT professor Nuno Loureiro was shot at his home in Brookline on Monday, Dec. 15.",
      "A tipster known as \"John\" in a Providence police affidavit reported that he encountered a man near Brown resembling the person of interest. John began posting on the social media forum Reddit that police should look into \"possibly a rental\" grey Nissan.",
      "Following up on that tip \"blew this case right open,\" Neronha said.",
      "\"Investigators identified the vehicle that he had rented in Boston and drove to Rhode Island,\" Foley said, and they also obtained footage of him from the rental car location. She said a financial investigation also linked him to the car and hotels.",
      "Security footage also showed the suspect within a half-mile of Loureiro's apartment, and there was footage showing him entering \"in the location of the professor's apartment,\" Foley said.",
      "About an hour later, he was seen entering the storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire.",
      "When he was found dead Thursday he was dressed in the same clothes that he was seen wearing right after Loureiro's murder, Foley said.",
      "\"We found records, with the help of the FBI and others, that that was his storage area,\" Neronha said.",
      "What was the suspect's connection to Brown University?",
      "Neves Valente was enrolled at Brown University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2001, Brown's president, Christina Paxson, said. He was admitted to the graduate school to study in a PhD physics program.",
      "Paxson said he took a leave of absence in April 2001, before formally withdrawing on July 31, 2003.",
      "He was only enrolled in physics classes while at the school, which were held in the same building where the shooting took place.",
      "\"The majority of physics classes at Brown have always been held at the Barus & Holley classrooms and labs,\" Paxson said.",
      "What was the suspect's connection to the MIT professor?",
      "Both the suspect and MIT professor Nuno Loureiro were from Portugal and attended the same university program there.",
      "In a statement, the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Portugal confirmed that Neves Valente had been a student at its Institute for Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion, studying for a degree in Engineering Physics between 1995 and 2000. Loureiro took the course during the same period, the institute said.",
      "\"My understanding is that they did know each other,\" Foley said.",
      "They were close in age \u2014 the suspect was 48 and Loureiro was 47 \u2014 and both studied physics. Loureiro went on to become a prominent scholar in the field of fusion energy research and was director of MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center.",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors announced new indictments Thursday in the widening Minnesota fraud scandal, this time involving two Philadelphia-based men accused of traveling to Minneapolis after a friend told them the taxpayer-funded programs there presented \"a good opportunity to make money.\"",
      "Anthony Waddell Jefferson and Lester Brown are accused of siphoning millions from federally funded programs administered by Minnesota officials that were meant to help people with disabilities and those suffering from addiction.",
      "Unlike many of the individuals previously caught up in the state's sprawling fraud scandal, they don't appear to have ties to Minnesota's large Somali-American community. Prosecutors say they don't appear to have ties to Minnesota at all.",
      "\"Minnesota has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry \u2014 people coming to our state purely to exploit and defraud its programs,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, who brought the new charges. \"This is a deeply unsettling reality that all Minnesotans should understand.\"",
      "Court filings allege the men submitted up to $3.5 million in \"fake and inflated bills\" for Medicaid reimbursements after they set up a company intended to provide housing and other services to individuals who qualified for the program. They allegedly fleeced the housing program in Minnesota despite \"living on the other side of the country and having no network in or connections to Minnesota or its communities.\"",
      "Jefferson and Brown were among six people indicted for fraud on Thursday.",
      "Abdinajib Hassan allegedly registered a company to help channel state resources to the families of children with autism, spending some of the $6 million he took from the program on the purchase of a Freightliner semi-truck.",
      "Hassan Ahmed Hussein and Ahmed Abdirashid Mohamed are accused of pocketing $750,000 intended to help Medicaid recipients find housing, then using the money on international travel.",
      "Kaamil Omar Sallah allegedly submitted $1.4 million in fraudulent claims as part of a housing stabilization services fraud scheme. He spent $150,000 of it on crypto and fled to Amsterdam after he was subpoenaed, officials say.",
      "Asha Farhan Hassan, who was previously charged in multiple fraud schemes, pleaded guilty Thursday to one count of wire fraud.",
      "Prosecutors said Thursday that they are investigating roughly $18 billion spent on social programs in Minnesota since 2018. CBS News asked how much they believe was fraud, and they said they've \"seen more red flags than legitimate providers.\" Thompson suggested half of the $18 billion or more could be fraudulent",
      "James Clark, the inspector general of Minnesota's Department of Human Services, said in a statement: \"Speculation that half of Medicaid payments for some services are fraudulent is shocking. If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses.\"",
      "Clark said the state is \"moving more aggressively than ever\" to halt possibly fraudulent payments, and requested a meeting with federal prosecutors.",
      "The newest allegations came as the Trump administration and its allies have stepped up attacks on Minnesota's leadership, including Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democratic Party's nominee for vice president in the 2024 elections.",
      "Walz has acknowledged his state fell short in its fraud fighting efforts and listed a series of steps he has taken to implement more safeguards for taxpayer-funded social services.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump-appointed heads of at least three cabinet agencies have signaled fresh investigations into the state's handling of federal funds \u2014 actions that a spokesperson for Walz called \"politically motivated\" in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\"While the governor has been fighting fraud, the Trump administration has spent the past month sending dozens of letters, statements and social media posts filled with threats to withhold funding and investigate the state,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Minnesota is not the only state to be hit by such crimes. Yesterday, federal prosecutors indicted two men in Massachusetts for stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) money meant for needy children.",
      "But Thursday's indictments in Minnesota were the latest development in a string of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes that have plagued that state. So far, federal prosecutors have convicted 62 people in connection to the scandal, which tops the list of the nation's most costly COVID-era fraud sprees. Federal prosecutors estimate taxpayer losses exceed $1 billion.",
      "The initial scheme involved a nonprofit organization that tricked state and federal officials into paying them to serve food to thousands of hungry children but never provided the meals. That group, Feeding Our Future, allegedly raked in $250 million.",
      "Additional fraud cases have since come into focus. This year, in August, state officials shut down a housing program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities, citing \"large-scale fraud.\" In September, prosecutors charged eight people with defrauding the program by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Also in September, a person was charged with defrauding another state program that provides services to kids with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program. She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program.",
      "The Treasury Department announced it would investigate whether any of the alleged fraudsters, many of whom are of Somali descent, funnelled money to al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. Multiple federal investigators told CBS News there is no evidence taxpayer dollars ever went to al Shabaab, and prosecutors have yet to present evidence linking any of the fraudsters to terrorism.",
      "\"The vast majority of the money that these folks made went to spending on luxury items for themselves,\" said Andy Luger, the former U.S. Attorney who prosecuted these frauds from 2022 until January.",
      "CBS News obtained dozens of files and photos that reveal how some Minnesota fraudsters blew through millions in taxpayer dollars, spending it on cars, property, jewelry and luxury travel. Videos show them popping champagne at an opulent Maldives resort. In a text message, one defendant boasts: \"You are gonna be the richest 25 year old InshaAllah [God willing].\"",

      "A top prosecutor suggested on Thursday that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could be $9 billion or more.",
      "According to First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, 14 Medicaid services under audit and deemed \"high risk\" for fraud have cost the state $18 billion since 2018.",
      "Thompson said a substantial amount of money billed across those programs is fraudulent, but the exact amount is still under investigation.",
      "\"I don't make these generalizations in a hasty way,\" he said. \"When I say significant amount, I'm talking on the order of half or more. But we'll see. When I look at the claims data and the providers, I see more red flags than I see legitimate providers.\"",
      "Minnesota Department of Human Services Inspector General James Clark released a statement, saying speculation of the amount of fraud occurring is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses,\" Clark said. \"We have been moving more aggressively than ever to suspend payments where we see evidence of fraud and refer criminals to law enforcement for prosecution. I've previously sent letters to the U.S. Attorney's Office asking them to share evidence of fraud and I'm requesting a meeting immediately to discuss how we can partner to stop criminals now.\"",
      "Thompson said the scale of fraud in Minnesota outpaces that of other states and puts services at risk for people who really need them.",
      "While prosecutors typically see fraud manifest as providers overbilling, Thompson said during a news conference in Minneapolis that companies have been created to provide zero services while pocketing federal funds for international travel, luxury vehicles and lavish lifestyles.",
      "\"The magnitude cannot be overstated,\" Thompson said. \"What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "The investigators' new findings may bolster President Trump in his claims that Minnesota is a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" under Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in last year's presidential election.",
      "Trump has capitalized on the fraud cases to target the Somali diaspora in Minnesota, calling them \"garbage\" and saying he doesn't want immigrants from the East African country in the U.S.",
      "More than 90% of the people charged in the major fraud cases announced before today were of Somali descent, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Minnesota.",
      "Walz has denounced Trump's comments, saying an audit due for completion by late January should give a better picture on the extent of the fraud. He said his administration is taking aggressive action to prevent fraud in the future. A spokesperson for Walz did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday.",
      "Five new defendants have been charged in connection with a Minnesota housing services fraud, Thompson said. Two of them pocketed $750,000 instead of helping Medicaid recipients find stable housing, he said. Prosecutors allege they used the proceeds to travel to international destinations, including London, Istanbul and Dubai.",
      "One defendant submitted $1.4 million in fraudulent claims, using some of the funds to purchase cryptocurrency, Thompson said. Federal officials say he fled the country after receiving a subpoena.",
      "The five charged include two Philadelphia residents who have been accused of \"fraud tourism\" after they registered as Minnesota providers, Thompson said, adding that for them the scheme was \"easy money.\"",
      "\"Minnesota has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry \u2013 people coming to our state purely to exploit and defraud its programs,\" Thompson said. \"This is a deeply unsettling reality that all Minnesotans should understand.\"",

      "Ferguson said it would \"take some time to get the debris off the runway to get it safe again.\" He added that the airport had no information about what caused the crash. AccuWeather said there were clouds and some drizzle at the time.",
      "The Statesville Regional Airport, which is about 45 minutes north of Charlotte, provides corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, the airport says on its website.",
      "Golfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.",

    "summary": "Instacart's \"unlawful tactics\" hurt shoppers and raised the cost of groceries, according to the FTC.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that 10 of its retail partners are testing that approach to pricing, describing such practices as a standard way stores assess customer preferences.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced that U.S. service members will receive a $1,776 bonus, which he called a \"warrior dividend,\" before Christmas.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the plan in a White House address billed as focusing on affordability, said the amount was inspired by the year of the nation's founding.",
      "The money is \"to both thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the U.S. military has been defending the nation,\" the White House said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about the dividend.",
      "Is it a recurring bonus?",
      "The \"warrior dividend\" is a one-time pay bump for the nation's 1.45 million\u00a0military service members, according to the White House.",
      "\"1776; as you know, our great nation was founded in the crucible of revolution in that year,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media video posted Thursday.",
      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",
      "Active duty service members who fell under the pay grades of O-6 or below as of Nov. 30 are eligible for the checks. Reserve component service members on active duty orders of 31 days as of that same date also qualify for the payments, according to the White House.",
      "In the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force, that includes people with the officer rank of colonel or below. For the Navy and Coast Guard, it includes those with the rank of captain or below.",
      "Active duty officers with an O-6 pay grade and two years of experience or less earn $8,340.90 a month, according to 2025 military pay charts. O-1 officers with the same amount of experience earn $3,998.40 monthly.",
      "When will the warrior dividend be paid?",
      "Military members are expected to receive their bonuses \"in the coming days,\" according to the White House.",
      "\"The checks are already on the way,\" Mr. Trump said from the White House on Wednesday. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military, and I say, 'congratulations' to everybody.\"",
      "In its statement on Thursday, the White House said service members can expect to receive the payments before Dec. 20.",
      "How is the dividend funded?",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested the \"warrior dividend\" payments are being funded both by his administration's tariffs and the\u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law this summer.",
      "The payments, which are expected to total $2.6 billion, will come from a $2.9 billion appropriation to the military in the new tax and spending law, a senior administration official told CBS News.",

      "Law enforcement officials in Providence, Rhode Island, on Wednesday confirmed that witnesses' description of the gunman in the\u00a0Brown University\u00a0shooting matches the images they have released of the person of interest in the case.",
      "As the search entered its fifth day, authorities have so far been unable to identify the person of interest in the shooting that killed\u00a0two students\u00a0and wounded nine others over the weekend. Police on Wednesday also released a map of the area showing the streets where they say a person of interest is confirmed to have been on Saturday, the day of the shooting.",
      "Police on Wednesday also\u00a0asked for the public's help\u00a0in identifying someone who they say was seen in the area near the person of interest, so they could speak to him. Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez  said the person investigators want to speak to appeared to have come near the person of interest at the corner of Benevolent and Cooke streets. In a video released by police, the person of interest appeared to suddenly stop and turn around as he approached the corner.",
      "\"I want to urge you, the public, not to rely on AI generated images that are currently being shared on social media,\" Perez warned at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. \"The updates and information you're getting will be provided exclusively through this department's social channels.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter if \"any items of interest\" have been found during the search so far, specifically clothing, Perez responded \"nothing as we speak, no.\"",
      "In order to avoid any misinformation, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said police have created a page on the department's website where all the digital evidence is currently published.",
      "Two of the wounded victims have so far been treated and released from the hospital, according to Smiley. One person remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition, and five others are in stable condition. The ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries.",
      "Several videos of a person of interest in the case were released earlier this week. They show what police say are \"enhanced\" images captured on the East Side of Providence on Saturday afternoon, approximately two hours before the shooting.",
      "The person of interest, who is wearing a face covering, is seen walking on a sidewalk and looking around \u2014 but it does not clearly show where the person went afterward, police said.",
      "\"At this point it's unknown to us where this person works, it's unknown to us if he was an affiliate of Brown, that's all unknown to us,\" Perez said.",
      "Perez also confirmed Wednesday that only one weapon was used. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha then interrupted a reporter's question about the gun, saying that certain details about the case don't advance the investigation if they're released to the public.",
      "\"As we interview witnesses, we don't want them to learn facts from these press conferences. We want them to relay the facts they have in their heads,\" Neronha said. \"We're being careful about the facts that we're sharing for that reason.\"",

      "Some of the footage released Tuesday by the Providence Police Department on social media appeared to be digitally enhanced versions of previously released videos. Police urged anyone with information to contact the FBI tip line online or at 401-272-3121.",
      "\"Even small details may be critical to this,\" police said.",
      "A source briefed on the investigation told CBS News the lack of usable surveillance video is significantly hampering the search for the shooter. That limitation is key reason police widened their request for video and photos on Wednesday to large perimeter around Brown University's campus.",
      "Investigators are specifically looking for footage that could show the suspect entering a vehicle, apartment, or residence in the moments after the shooting. An image released earlier Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far since the shooting on Saturday.",
      "The FBI said the person of interest is about 5-foot-8 with a stocky build. The agency has also shared a timeline of when the videos were captured, including some videos that appear to have been obtained from residents' private cameras. The person of interest is seen from about 2 p.m. on Saturday until just after 4 p.m., around the time the shooting took place.",
      "Police said the individual was walking near Hope and Benevolent streets, just down the block from the Barus & Holley engineering building where the gunman opened fire. Authorities said Monday they had no information about a motive at this point.",
      "The FBI has offered a\u00a0$50,000 reward\u00a0for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the gunman.",
      "Amid growing questions about campus security measures and the lack of better surveillance video, the university released a statement Wednesday saying that while Brown has \"an expansive network of security cameras,\" the cameras \"do not extend to every hallway, classroom, laboratory and office across the 250+ buildings on campus.\"",

    "summary": "Putin claims no \"willingness from Ukraine\" to negotiate a peace deal as he touts battlefield gains, and Kyiv claims a brazen strike on a ship far from Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his country was \"not seeing the willingness from Ukraine\" to negotiate a peace deal, again blaming the country he ordered a full-scale invasion of nearly four years ago for the continuation of a war he's refused even to acknowledge is a war.",
      "Putin said he was open to a negotiated end to what he calls a \"special military operation,\" but only on his terms, insisting, as he has for years, that Ukraine must accept a massive, formal forfeiture of occupied territory and some degree of national demilitarization \u2014   both terms that Kyiv has rejected.",
      "The Russian president said his forces had \"fully seized strategic initiative\" in the conflict and would take even more ground along the roughly 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine before the end of the year.",
      "\"Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,\" Putin said during the live, wide-ranging end-of-year news conference that has been a hallmark of his tenure.",
      "His remarks came as Ukraine claimed a dramatic new blow against Russia, but also as divisions among European nations over how to keep supporting Kyiv \u2014 fueled, many believe, by Moscow's pressure tactics \u2014 were laid bare.",
      "Putin's latest casting of blame for the war at both Kyiv and its backers in Europe also came as a senior\u00a0Russian envoy prepared to meet again for talks with Trump administration officials in Florida this weekend. The White House is pushing hard for a negotiated resolution to the conflict that President Trump had vowed to end quickly when he took office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday called proposals being negotiated with the U.S. \"very workable,\" suggesting they could be finalized in a matter of days, allowing American officials to discuss with their Russian counterparts.",
      "Ukraine claims drone strike on Russian \"shadow fleet\" tanker in Mediterranean",
      "Ukraine has been defending itself with the support of the U.S. and its European partners, and as Putin spoke in Moscow, Kyiv claimed a significant expansion of its wartime resistance, with a first purported attack on an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's sanctions-violating \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency said Friday that it had \"struck a tanker belonging to Russia's 'shadow fleet' in neutral waters in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time,\" touting it as an \"unprecedented special operation more than 2,000 km [1,200 miles] from the territory of our state.\"",
      "The SBU said it used aerial drones to disable the Oman-flagged oil tanker Qendil, which it said was empty at the time, and thus \"did not pose any threat to the ecological situation in the region.\"",
      "The SBU shared a black-and-white video, seemingly captured by a drone, of the purported strike that shows several explosions on the deck of a tanker.",
      "\"Russia used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" a source in the SBU told CBS News. \"Therefore, from the point of view of international law and the laws and customs of war, this is an absolutely legitimate target for the SBU. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will strike it anywhere in the world, wherever it may be.\"",
      "Ukraine has long targeted\u00a0fuel tankers and\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0in Russian ports and on land as part of its efforts to undermine Moscow's war funding, but only this month has Kyiv acknowledged attacking vessels outside Russia's territorial waters. CBS News reported on the first such strikes, targeting tankers off the coasts of Turkey and West Africa, just over a week ago.",
      "The SBU said the new strike had disabled the Qendil, which ship tracking website MarineTraffic.com confirmed was located in the eastern Mediterranean as of Friday afternoon. According to MarineTraffic, the vessel \u2014   which has not been listed by the U.S. Treasury among the Russian shadow fleet ships subjected to sanctions \u2014   was sailing from the Indian port of Sikka to the Russian port of Ust-Luga.",
      "The U.S. government has sanctioned many vessels and maritime companies in an effort to crack down on Russia's shadow fleet, ships with often murky registration and ownership that Moscow allegedly uses to evade heavy Western sanctions on its energy products, providing vital revenue for its war effort.",
      "The Trump administration accuses several major oil producers, including Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, of using a global fleet of such ships, and just last week, U.S. military forces seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0after it left a port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News.",
      "Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was\u00a0sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago\u00a0for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the Middle East.",
      "Asked Friday about the strike on the Qendil during his news conference, Putin was dismissive, but vowed to respond.",
      "\"They're pursuing some utilitarian purposes,\" the Russian leader said, without confirming any specifics. \"They want to raise insurance premiums, but this will not bring about the result they desire. This is not going to disrupt the supplies. This would only create additional threats, and Russia is certainly going to respond.\"",
      "Despite divisions, EU agrees on financial lifeline for Ukraine",
      "The European Union, meanwhile, stepped up overnight to offer a support package for Ukraine worth more than $100 billion \u2014 but the bloc could not agree on proposals pushed by leaders to use frozen Russian assets to do it.",
      "After failing to agree on specifics, the EU ended up taking out an interest-free loan for Ukraine, against its own budget, intended to fund the country's military and economic needs for two years.",
      "EU leaders wanted to finance the aid package with the frozen Russian assets, but there was always resistance to that idea among some members \u2014   most notably Belgium, where much of the ringfenced Russian money is held.",
      "Putin renewed threats in his remarks on Friday that there would be severe consequences for European nations that chose to use the Russian money, held as part of the sanctions against Moscow.",

      "Russia has been accused repeatedly in recent months of waging a hybrid war against Ukraine's European partners, with a series of unclaimed drone incursions, including around airports and military bases, Russian warplanes violating European \u2014   and NATO \u2014   airspace, and other acts of alleged sabotage targeting vital infrastructure.",
      "\"If Europe had walked away today without an agreement, we would not only have failed Ukraine, we would have failed ourselves,\" Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said Friday, putting a positive spin on the agreement that was reached.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the agreement for a \"zero-interest loan\" for Ukraine, and leaving room for the Russian assets to be leveraged in the future.",
      "\"These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come,\" Merz said, noting that the frozen Russian assets will remain blocked unless and until Russia pays reparations to Ukraine for the huge damage inflicted during the war.",
      "\"If Russia does not pay reparations, we will \u2014   in full accordance with international law \u2014   make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan,\" the German leader said.",
      "Ukraine's government welcomed the deal, but made it clear that Kyiv still feels Russia's frozen assets should be accessed in support of its defense.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:33:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia will use a sweeping buyback scheme to \"get guns off our streets,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney\u00a0\u2014 Australia will use a sweeping buyback scheme to \"get guns off our streets,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday, showing his government was keen to take quick action less than a week after a terrorist attack left 15 people dead at a Jewish holiday gathering on Sydney's famed Bondi Beach.",
      "Sajid Akram and his son Naveed are accused of opening fire on the festival, which was organized to mark the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday, in what was one of Australia's deadliest mass shootings.",
      "Just hours after the attack, Albanese vowed to toughen national gun laws that allowed 50-year-old Sajid to own six high-powered rifles.",
      "\"There is no reason someone living in the suburbs of Sydney needed this many guns,\" he said.",
      "Australia would pay gun owners to surrender \"surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms.\"",
      "Albanese said Monday that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\" He specifically suggested measures that could limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and mandating a review process for existing licenses.",
      "The prime minister said the federal government would evenly split the cost of the buyback program with Australia's state and territorial administrations, with further details to be worked out when lawmakers return to work next week.",
      "Investigation continues as Sydney remains on high alert",
      "Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in a gunfight with police, but his 24-year-old son Naveed survived. The unemployed bricklayer was charged earlier this week with 15 counts of murder, an act of terrorism, and dozens of other serious crimes after waking up from a coma in a Sydney hospital.",
      "Albanese said the attack was inspired by ISIS ideology, and Australian police are still investigating whether the pair may have met with Islamist extremists during a visit to the Philippines just a couple weeks before the shooting.",
      "They spent most of November in the south of the Asian nation, in a hotel in Davao City. A hotel employee told CBS News on Thursday that the father and son extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said staff noticed nothing particularly suspicious about the men during their nearly monthlong stay.",
      "Sydney, meanwhile, remains on high alert almost a week after the shootings.",
      "Armed police released seven men from custody on Friday, a day after detaining them on a tip they may have been plotting a \"violent act,\" as they reportedly headed for Bondi Beach.",
      "Police said there was no established link with the alleged Bondi gunmen and \"no immediate safety risk to the community.\"",
      "A second major Australian gun buyback spurred by a mass shooting",
      "The new buyback, assuming it is approved by lawmakers next week, will be the largest such government-funded program since 1996, when then-Prime Minister John Howard cracked down on firearms in the wake of another mass shooting, in which 35 people were killed in the town of Port Arthur.",
      "Just 12 days after that attack, Australian lawmakers approved legislation banning the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forcing people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy any firearm, and initiating the massive, mandatory gun-buyback for banned weapons.",
      "The government confiscated and destroyed nearly 700,000 firearms in the wake of the law's adoption, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.",
      "\"It is incontestable that gun-related homicides have fallen quite significantly in Australia,\" former premier Howard, who defied many in his own conservative party to usher in the 1996 law, told CBS News' Seth Doane two decades later, in 2016.",
      "In the 15 years before those laws were passed, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia. In the two decades after, there wasn't a single one. Gun homicides overall decreased by nearly 60% in the same period.",
      "Asked to respond to critics who said the fall in gun deaths did not necessarily happen because of the legislation, Howard told CBS News: \"The number of deaths from mass shootings, gun-related homicide has fallen, gun related suicide has fallen \u2026 Isn't that evidence? Or are we expected to believe that that was all magically going to happen? Come on!\"",
      "A study published earlier this year, however, found Australia still has some way to go to fully implement the 2016 legislation, called the National Firearms Agreement. The\u00a0paper, by the Australia Institute think tank, said some of the measures had yet to be brought into force 29 years later, and others were being inconsistently enforced across different states.",
      "The law \"was ambitious, politically brave, and necessary for public safety,\" the report concluded, lauding Howard's will to defy his fellow lawmakers.",
      "But \"Australia still allows minors to hold firearm licenses, still lacks a National Firearms Register, and still has inconsistent laws that make enforcement difficult,\" the group said, adding that overall gun ownership across the country had actually boomed over the last three decades.",
      "\"There are now over four million registered privately owned guns in Australia: 800,000 more than before the (1996) buyback,\" the institute said in its May report. \"Australians needs gun laws that live up to the Howard Government's bravery, and right now Australia does not have them.\"",
      "Albanese, along with state and territorial leaders, agreed on Monday to look at ways to bolster gun laws, including by accelerating the launch of the national firearms register called for in the 1996 legislation, making gun licenses available only to Australian citizens, and imposing new restrictions the types of weapons that are legal for licensees to own.",
      "A memorial at sea, and a day of reflection planned for Bondi Beach victims",
      "Hundreds of people plunged into the ocean at Bondi Beach on Friday to honor the 15 people killed in the terror attack, forming a massive ring in the sea on surf and paddle boards, as Albanese announced a national day of reflection to be observed on Sunday.",
      "Albanese urged Australians to light candles at 6:47 p.m. on Sunday, \"exactly one week since the attack unfolded.\"",
      "On Friday, swimmers and surfers paddled into a circle, bobbing in the gentle morning swell, splashing water and roaring with emotion.",
      "\"They slaughtered innocent victims, and today I'm swimming out there and being part of my community again to bring back the light,\" security consultant Jason Carr, 53, told AFP. \"We're still burying bodies. But I just felt it was important.\"",
      "Carole Schlessinger, a 58-year-old chief executive of a children's charity, said there was a \"beautiful energy\" at the ocean gathering. \"To be together is such an important way of trying to deal with what's going on.\"",
      "\"It was really lovely to be part of it,\" she said, adding: \"I personally am feeling very numb. I'm feeling super angry. I'm feeling furious.\"",

The 10-year-old girl, who has been publicly identified only as Matilda, has become a symbol of the country's grief for the 15 people killed by two gunmen.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is set to meet with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday, according to an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that hasn't yet been publicly announced.",
      "The official said that Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week, in which they discussed U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan aimed at ending the war.",
      "Asked about the meeting in Miami, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow was preparing for contacts with the U.S. to learn about the results of the meetings in Berlin, but didn't give further details.",
      "Witkoff will also meet Friday in Miami with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss the next phase of the Gaza deal, a senior State Department official confirmed to CBS News.",

The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month he planned to meet with Mr. Trump soon to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, 2022, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin's demands in peace talks.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured yet.",
      "The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a \"legitimate target.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:11:21 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's announcement of plan to sell Taiwan a record $10 billion worth of weapons draws an angry response from China.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all.",
      "The tension between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest single economies, has ebbed and flowed during Mr. Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to reunify with the mainland. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to make that a reality.",
      "If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during the Biden administration.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.",
      "The State Department said the sales serve \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"",
      "\"The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\" the statements said.",
      "China blasts U.S.-Taiwan arms deals, says they \"will only end up backfiring\"",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",
      "\"The 'Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.",
      "\"This cannot save the doomed fate of 'Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for 'Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\" Guo added.",
      "The U.S. role in Taiwan's \"self-defense capabilities\"",
      "Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.",
      "President Trump, in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes aired in early November, said Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't bring up the issue of Taiwan when the two leaders met in late October, but he said Xi knew \"the consequences\" of taking military action against the island.",
      "\"He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But they understand what's gonna happen. He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell whether he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if Xi did move militarily on the island, Mr. Trump said, \"I can't give away my secrets.\"",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \"sufficient self-defense capabilities\" and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \"is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\" the ministry said.",
      "Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.",
      "The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Mr. Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.",
      "The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Mr. Trump is expected to sign Thursday. Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.",

      "A lawyer from the firm representing him, Ornella Spatafora, said he would appeal.",
      "An investigation was launched in 2017, after suspicious cardiac arrests were recorded during operations on patients considered low-risk.",
      "During the more than three-month trial, prosecutors called for Pechier to be jailed for life, saying he \"used medicine to kill.\"",
      "They say he contaminated IV bags with potassium, local anaesthetics, adrenaline, and even an anticoagulant to trigger cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients being treated by colleagues.",
      "His goal, prosecutors said, was to \"psychologically hurt\" caregivers with whom he was in conflict and to \"feed his thirst for power.\"",
      "Pechier had argued during the probe that the majority of poisonings were the result of \"medical errors\" made by his colleagues.",
      "He admitted during the trial that there had been a person poisoning patients in one of the two clinics where he worked, but said it was not him.",
      "\"I am not a poisoner,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever the outcome of all this, my career is over,\" Pechier told reporters at a press conference in 2019, BBC News\u00a0reported. \"You cannot trust a doctor who, at one point, has been labeled a poisoner. ... My family is broken and I am afraid for my children.\"",
      "Some colleagues described the doctor as a \"star anesthetist,\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",
      "One colleague described Pechier as a very good doctor with an \"oversized ego.\"",
      "Le Monde reported\u00a0that one of Pechier's lawyers withdrew from the case, citing insufficient compensation.",
      "In tears during the trial earlier this month, Pechier recounted trying to kill himself in 2021.",

      "He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",

      "Ecuadorian police said on Wednesday that Mario Pineida, a 33-year-old Barcelona de Guayaquil defender and former national team player, was shot dead in an apparent attack as violence escalates in the Andean nation.",
      "Another person who police did not identify was also killed in the incident, and a third was wounded.",
      "Ecuador's Interior Ministry confirmed Pineida's death without providing details. Barcelona de Guayaquil said in a statement its fans are saddened by Pineida's death. \"Rest in peace,\" the team wrote in a separate social media post paying tribute to Pineida.",
      "Pineida played eight games for Ecuador but was not involved in the team qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. His last game for Ecuador was at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, as a late substitute in a group-stage game against Brazil. He also went to the 2017 edition.",
      "Pineida started his professional career at Independiente del Valle, where he played from 2010 to 2015. He then moved to the club of the coastal city of Guayaquil in 2016 and won two league titles there. The defender also had a brief spell at Brazil's Fluminense in 2022.",
      "Ecuadorian media reported the incident took place in the region of Samanes in the north end of Guayaquil, which lies 165 miles southwest of the capital Quito.",
      "Playing soccer in Ecuador can be deadly, with match-fixing mafias part of a global criminal empire that earns gangs some $1.7 trillion per year, according to a recent United Nations estimate.",
      "In November, a 16-year-old footballer of Independiente del Valle died from a stray bullet, also in Guayaquil. Miguel Nazareno was at home \"when he unfortunately became a victim of the insecurity affecting our country,\" the soccer team\u00a0said in an Instagram post, citing a wave of criminal violence began in Ecuador almost five years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Four people were killed in a U.S. military strike Wednesday on an alleged drug-running boat in the Eastern Pacific, the Pentagon said. It marks the latest in a series of strikes dating back to early September that the U.S. has conducted on what it claims are drug-trafficking vessels in the region.",
      "In a social media post, U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Central and South America, said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the \"lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters.\"",
      "As has been the case with previous such strikes, Southern Command also posted unclassified video showing the boat as it was struck.",
      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,\" Southern Command said.",
      "The victims were described as \"four male narco-terrorists.\" The U.S. military provided no evidence to support allegations that the boat was ferrying drugs.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted 26 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific or Caribbean since Sept. 2, killing at least 99 people, according to the Pentagon.",
      "In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny on the strikes after the White House, following a report by The Washington Post, confirmed that in the Sept. 2 attack, the same boat was struck twice, or what has been described as a \"double tap\" or follow-on strike.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that the follow-on strike killed two people who had survived the first strike and were waving overhead. A separate source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the two survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat.",
      "A total of 11 people were killed by both strikes on Sept. 2, according to the U.S. military.",
      "While video of the Sept. 2 strikes has been shown to some congressional lawmakers in classified briefings, there has been a push for the Pentagon to release the video publicly. However, Hegseth, speaking Tuesday on Capitol Hill,\u00a0said he would not do so.",
      "\"Of course we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,\" Hegseth told reporters.",
      "Some lawmakers and legal experts have contended that the second strike could constitute a war crime.",
      "The vessel strikes have been part of a pressure campaign by the Trump administration on embattled Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom it accuses of being involved in trafficking drugs to the U.S. and collaborating with drug cartels. Venezuela has criticized the boat strikes, and Maduro denies working with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

      "Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, the assistant rabbi at the local Chabad-Lubavitch of Bondi, who had helped to organize what started out as a joyous event on the famous beach, was the first to be mourned on Wednesday.",
      "The funeral took place just a few blocks from where he and other members of Sydney's tight-knit Jewish community were gunned down.",
      "After sharp criticism over what many saw as lax security for the Sunday event, there was a heavy police presence around the synagogue on Wednesday. Officers were seen checking the identification of those heading toward the funeral.",
      "\"He was an angel,\" Rabbi Moshe Gutnick told CBS News as Schlanger's body was transported. \"He was goodness personified. Everything that he did was about doing good for people.\"",
      "\"He was the heart and soul of the synagogue,\" he added. \"We are all going to miss him terribly.\"",
      "Gutnick's brother-in-law, 62-year-old Reuven Morrison, was also among those killed on Sunday, as he hurled stones at one of the attackers, Morrison's daughter told CBS News earlier this week.",

    "summary": "The votes follow a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The latest Democratic-led attempt to limit President Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region failed Wednesday, as tensions with the South American country continue to escalate.",
      "House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump has warned that land strikes against the country could commence \"soon.\" Mr. Trump's threats come amid a months-long military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 95 people.",
      "Both measures fell short.",
      "The first measure, introduced by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, would remove U.S. armed forces \"from hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere,\" unless Congress has declared war or authorized the use of military force for such purposes. It failed in a 210 to 216 vote.",
      "A second measure from Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts would remove the armed forces \"from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" Some 211 voted in favor and 213 voted against it.",
      "Meeks' resolution had the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Don Bacon of Nebraska, while Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against it.",
      "Three Republicans \u2014 Massie, Bacon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 supported McGovern's resolution. Cuellar was the lone Democrat to vote against.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. But the White House has suggested that the decades-old law does not apply to the boat strikes because it does not view the attacks as putting service members in harm's way.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held two separate classified briefings Tuesday for all senators and House members. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee received a more detailed briefing on Wednesday with Navy Adm. Frank Bradley, who ordered a second strike killing survivors of the initial Sept. 2 boat attack.",
      "Meeks left Tuesday's House briefing saying members received no adequate explanation for why the Trump administration has not consulted Congress before the strikes. He also questioned the president's motivations.",
      "\"It doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking,\" Meeks told reporters Tuesday. \"So if this is about regime change, it seems to me that the administration should say that's what it is, and should come to Congress to ask for that authorization, which has not taken place.\"",
      "Bacon said after Wednesday's briefing that he would vote to authorize military action against Venezuela, but he still believes that Mr. Trump needs to get approval from Congress.",
      "\"I think there's enough support in Congress to pass an authorization,\" Bacon added. \"The mission is right, but continued hostilities does require congressional approval.\"",
      "A day before the votes, Vanity Fair published a piece based on nearly a dozen interviews with Mr. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, in which she said the president \"wants to keep on blowing boats up until [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.\"",
      "The statement appeared to be in contradiction with the administration's stance that it is conducting the strikes to stop the flow of drugs to the U.S., not ousting Maduro.",
      "Wiles conceded that strikes on land would require congressional approval.",
      "\"If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then [we'd need] Congress,\" she told Vanity Fair.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"very concerned\" about the U.S. actions around Venezuela.",
      "\"At this point, we still don't have a clear idea of what the president is trying to accomplish,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"But it sure looks like he's trying to accomplish regime change in Venezuela, and that he's willing to go to war and accomplish that, all without any congressional authorization.\"",
      "In a further escalation of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Maduro, the president on Tuesday said he was declaring the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization\" and called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that the president has the authority to order the boat strikes under his constitutional authority.",
      "\"It is certainly appropriate,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. \"It's necessary to protect the United States and our interests.\"",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued the president does not need congressional authorization to carry out \"precise, limited strikes.\"",
      "\"This president wants to be the judge, jury and the executioner,\" said Meeks, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat.",

    "story": [
      "A Second Amendment clash has erupted between the federal government and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "The U.S. government sued the U.S. territory, its police department and Police Commissioner Mario Brooks on Tuesday, accusing them of obstructing and systematically denying American citizens the right to possess and carry guns.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands requires that applicants demonstrate \"good reason to fear death or great injury to his person or property,\" and to have \"two credible persons\" to vouch for their need of a firearm. Local law also requires that someone have \"good moral character\" to obtain a gun permit, which is valid for up to three years and applies to a single weapon.",
      "The lawsuit states that no specific standard has been set or defined for the requirement of character. It also claims that the defendants \"regularly\" refuse to issue permits to those who by law are \"deemed to be an improper person\" by the territory's police commissioner.",
      "The lawsuit states that those in the U.S. territory also must \"submit to intrusive and warrantless home searches\" as one condition to obtain a gun permit. If an applicant refuses a home inspection, which takes \"several months to a year to schedule and complete,\" the government will not process their request, according to the lawsuit.",
      "It also notes that the police department \"denies firearms licenses to otherwise qualified applicants whenever it deems that the applicant has 'too many' firearms.\"",
      "In addition, the lawsuit accuses the U.S. Virgin Islands of demanding that applicants \"unnecessarily spend money to install a safe,\" and that it be bolted to the floor or wall of their home.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the defendants of defying \"binding Supreme Court precedent to frustrate the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens.\"",
      "It notes that those citizens \"have a fundamental right to possess guns in their homes\" and carry handguns publicly for the purpose of immediate self-defense.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It asks that a judge find that the defendants are violating the Second Amendment and seeks an injunction to prohibit them from implementing local laws tied to the issuance of firearms licenses.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands government said in a statement late Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit and taking the allegations seriously.",
      "It noted that the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. and Lt. Gov. Tregenza A. Roach \"is committed to protecting constitutional rights while maintaining public safety.\"",
      "The statement said that the allegations would be addressed in court, and that no further comment would be issued.",
      "The lawsuit was filed as the administration of President Trump pushes to expand gun rights. Last year, Trump claimed that the Second Amendment was \"under siege\" and described himself as \"the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After Bondi Beach attack, Britain's two biggest police forces indicate they will arrest people who use \"phrases causing fear in Jewish communities.\"",
    "story": [
      "Britain's two biggest police forces announced Wednesday that officers would take an \"enhanced approach\" to counter antisemitism, arresting protesters who use certain slogans and phrases, in response to a surge in\u00a0hate crimes targeting Jewish people in the United Kingdom.",
      "The\u00a0announcement was a response, the London Metropolitan and Greater Manchester Police forces said, to Sunday's\u00a0terrorist attack in Bondi Beach, Australia, targeting a Hanukkah event, in which 15 people were fatally shot. Police also cited a spate of incidents on British soil, including a vehicle and knife assault outside a synagogue in Manchester in October that left two Jewish people dead.",
      "\"Antisemitic hate crime has surged, protests have intensified, and online abuse has grown since 2023,\" the police forces said. \"The increased fear in Jewish communities, and high number of terrorist attacks disrupted in recent years requires an enhanced response.\"",
      "\"The words and chants used, especially in protests, matter and have real world consequences,\" the statement said. \"Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive.\"",
      "The forces said that officers \"have consistently been advised\" by British prosecutors that \"many of the phrases causing fear in Jewish communities don't meet prosecution thresholds\" under the U.K.'s current hate speech laws, so the new approach would work largely under the existing Public Order Act.",
      "\"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalize the intifada' and those using it at future protest or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action,\" the police said. \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\"",
      "\"The current laws are inadequate,\" said the statement attributed to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and Manchester Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson, adding that the forces welcomed a planned review by the government of existing public order and hate crime laws.",
      "\"Jewish communities across London, Greater Manchester, and the rest of the United Kingdom are already worried and scared,\" the police statement said, and that the attacks in Australia and Manchester \"only adds to it.\"",
      "The police said officers would be briefed on this new approach, calling the measures \"practical and immediate,\" but offering little detail on what, beyond the specific phrase about a global \"intifada,\" might now be deemed illegal behavior.",
      "It said there had already been stepped-up police patrols around synagogues, Jewish schools and community venues.",
      "\"Our intent is clear: create a hostile environment for offenders and a safer environment for Jewish communities, while protecting lawful protest,\" the police said. \"It is possible to protest in support of Palestinian people without intimidating Jewish communities or breaking the law.\"",
      "One of the leaders of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.K., Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal, criticized the announcement by the British police, calling it \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights,\" according to CBS News' partner network BBC News.",
      "He said there was no consultation with his organization \"before making this far-reaching statement on our rights.\"",
      "\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Jamal said.",
      "The Board of Deputies of British Jews advocacy group said in a social media post that its members \"strongly welcome this necessary intervention\" by the police forces, which it said came \"after repeated urging from the Board of Deputies and others.\"",
      "Australia takes a different approach",
      "Authorities in Australia are still in the early days of their investigation into the Bondi Beach attack, but they have faced sharp criticism from the Jewish community in Sydney and abroad over a perceived lack of preparedness given a documented rise in antisemitism.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said it was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" and he and was quick to label it \"an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism.\"",
      "Albanese said just hours after the attack that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\"",
      "Police have said the suspects \u2014 a father and son \u2014   used rifles and shotguns owned legally by the older man. Albanese proposed new laws to limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and a review into how existing licenses could be subject to renewal over time.",
      "Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales state, where Bondi Beach is located, said Monday that the attack \"demands an overwhelming response,\" announcing that more than 320 police officers would be \"deployed today, and we will continue to increase that number.\"",
      "He said Tuesday that the state was looking at reforms that could include denying permission for protests after terror events.",
      "\"My concern is that a mass demonstration in this combustible situation with our multicultural community could light a flame that would be impossible to extinguish,\" Minns told reporters, according to The Guardian newspaper. \"In many cases, particularly in relation to restrictions on protests, there are constitutional issues. So, it has to be drafted in a particular way. We have to be very clear about the designation and the reason for it. I'm being crystal clear about it. I'm worried about a combustible situation and community harmony. That's the reason we would introduce this legislation. It's begun, the drafting process has begun. But when it's completed I'll let you know.\"",
      "The state premier added, however, that there had been \"a lot of conflation that protests lead to violence because some chants are being said, yet the events on Sunday were not related to a protest at all.\"",
      "Minns said any new law brought in would target no specific group, but rather \"be a blanket rule in place\" only in the wake of a terrorist incident.",
      "Albanese, speaking in a radio interview on Wednesday, highlighted some of the measures his government has already taken to address antisemitism, including appointing the nation's first ever envoy dedicated to the topic.",
      "\"We've strengthened legislation to address antisemitism and hateful conduct \u2014 criminalized hate speech advocating violence,\" Albanese said, noting also \"a landmark ban on the Nazi salute and hate symbols\" adopted last year.",
      "\"We've enhanced protection of Jewish communities,\" the prime minister said, adding in conclusion: \"There's more to do.\"",

    "summary": "Ahmed al Ahmed, the Syrian-Australian father who wrestled a shotgun from one of the gunmen attacking a Jewish gathering, is facing a long road to recovery.",
    "story": [
      "Like many Australians strolling at Bondi Beach on long, warm summer evenings, Ahmed al Ahmed just wanted a cup of coffee with a friend. Around him, a bloody massacre erupted as two gunmen targeted Jews during Hanukkah festivities at a park close to the shore.",
      "Soon al Ahmed was creeping, bent over, between two parked cars, before barreling directly toward one of the unsuspecting shooters. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the 44-year-old father can be seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker.",
      "The story of the Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner who put an end to the rampage of one of the shooters on Sunday has been seized upon by a country desperately seeking comfort after one of its darkest hours: the slaying of 15 people as they celebrated their Jewish faith.",
      "\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday, as he left a Sydney hospital where al Ahmed is being treated for gunshot wounds. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",
      "A fundraising page established by Australians who had never met al Ahmed had attracted by Tuesday night donations by some 40,000 people, who gave 2.3 million Australian dollars ($1.5 million). Among the supporters was the billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who pledged AU$99,000.",
      "Al Ahmed, who is married with two young daughters, faces a long struggle ahead, those who have spoken to him since Sunday's massacre say. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman in the attack as the man fired indiscriminately from a footbridge.",
      "He has already undergone surgery and more operations are scheduled, said Lubaba alhmidi Alkahil, a spokesperson for the Australians for Syria Association, who visited al Ahmed in a hospital late Monday. The \"quiet and humble\" man was conscious but frail and faced at least six months of recovery, Alkahil said.",
      "Under Australia's national, tax-funded health care system, Al Ahmed, who is a permanent legal resident of the country, is unlikely to face any bills for his care.",
      "In the days since the attack, a pile of floral tributes and notes of thanks has grown outside the small convenience store al Ahmed owns opposite a train station in suburban Sydney. Meanwhile, he has received visits at the hospital from Australia's leaders, apparently telling Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, that he'd take the same action again.",
      "He has been hailed as a hero by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia's Governor General, who is the representative of Britain's King Charles in the country. Minns said al Ahmed saved \"countless\" lives in what the premier said was \"the most unbelievable scene I've ever seen.\"",
      "Al Ahmed lived in the town of Nayrab in Syria's Idlib region before he arrived in Australia, his cousin Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. He left Syria in 2006 after finishing his studies, before the 2011 mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad that were met with a brutal crackdown and spiraled into a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "Nayrab was heavily bombed by Assad's forces with most of the town's houses flattened and reduced to rubble. On Tuesday, al Ahmed was the talk of the town.",
      "\"Ahmed did really a heroic job,\" his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. \"Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.\"",
      "Ahmed al Ahmed's parents, who came to Sydney this year to reunite with their son, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that their son had served with the police and in the central security forces in Syria. Father Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said his son's \"conscience and soul\" compelled him to act on Sunday.",
      "\"I feel pride and honor because my son is a hero of Australia,\" the father said.",
      "In the aftermath of the mass killing, a country roiling from one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever on its soil - allegedly committed by an Australian resident who arrived from India in 1998 and his Australian-born son - looked for hope amid their grief.",
      "Other stories of heroism have also emerged.",
      "They included the tale of a married couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were both killed while trying to stop one of the shooters as he climbed from his car and began the massacre, their family has told Australian news outlets.",
      "\"Bondi locals, together they lived honest, hardworking lives and treated everyone they met with kindness, warmth and respect,\" the family said in a statement. \"Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void.\"",
      "Reuven Morrison, 62, was also killed while trying to stop the horror, according to his daughter, Sheina Gutnick. After al Ahmed wrestled the gun from one shooter, Morrison can be seen throwing objects at the gunman - before he was shot by the second man.",
      "\"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members,\" Gutnick told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "Acts of courage like these were cited by many on social media and in news outlets as examples of what being Australian should mean.",
      "\"When he did what he did, he wasn't thinking at all about the background of the people he's saving, the people dying in the street,\" Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said of his son. \"He doesn't discriminate between one nationality and another, especially here in Australia there's no difference between one citizen and another.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:02:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

    "summary": "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that the terror attack on Jewish people at Bondi Beach was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "The father and son suspects in the terror attack on Jewish people gathered for a Hanukkah event in Bondi Beach, Australia, spent most of November in the Philippines, police said Tuesday. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, meanwhile, that the attack was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
      "New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went between Nov. 1 and 28. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, and his 24-year-old son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, had listed the southern city of Davao as their final destination on the trip.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC reported the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Asian nation, citing security sources.",
      "Philippine officials denied it. Presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "\"People have traveled and networked amongst these groups, but very, very rarely,\" Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News. \"And this is often overblown.\"",
      "The Philippines' history with Islamist insurgency",
      "Islamist separatists have operated in the southern Philippines for decades \u2014 it's \"an insurgency which is almost 100 years in the making,\" according to Smith.",
      "He said two longstanding militant groups \u2014 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, known as the MILF, and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF \u2014 have been \"sort of the grandfather, old rebellious groups of the Islamist movement\" in the Philippines.",
      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the country.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

    "summary": "The men suspected of attacking a Jewish gathering on Bondi Beach were inspired by the ISIS terror group and spent weeks last month in the Philippines, officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday that the father and son suspects in the antisemitic terror attack on a Hanukkah gathering on Bondi Beach were inspired by ISIS, as officials in India confirmed that the older man was originally from that nation.",
      "Authorities also revealed that gunmen had recently returned from the Philippines, where they traveled to an area known as a hotbed for terrorist groups.",
      "The mass shooting on the famous beach left 15 innocent people dead, including a 10-year-old girl and an Holocaust survivor. The attack was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" Albanese said Tuesday as he visited one of the heroes who tried to stop the attackers.",
      "Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett also said Tuesday that it was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" referring to the now disparate group that, for several years, held a huge swathe of territory spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "The suspects, a father and son aged 50 and 24, used guns that were owned legally by the older man, whom officials in New South Wales state have named as Sajid Akram. He was shot dead at the scene, and his son was still being treated in a hospital on Tuesday, where he had regained consciousness.",
      "Police said Wednesday that the younger man was charged with 59 offenses including 15 counts of murder and one of terrorism.",
      "Indian police confirm father was from Hyderabad",
      "Police in the southern Indian state of Telangana confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Sajid Akram was originally from the city of Hyderabad. In a statement, the police said he earned a degree in Hyderabad before migrating to Australia in November 1998, where he married a woman of European origin.",
      "Sajid Akram held an Indian passport, while his son Naveed and a daughter were both born in Australia and are citizens of the country, the police said, confirming previous statements by Australian officials about the son's nationality. U.S. officials had told CBS News soon after the attack that at least one of the Akrams was believed to be a Pakistani national, but that appears to have been a case of mistaken identity, and a man with the same name as the younger suspect has come forward in Sydney to say he was wrongly identified.",
      "The Telangana police said the elder Akram had \"limited contact with his family in Hyderabad over the past 27 years,\" visiting six times since he migrated to Australia, \"primarily for family-related reasons.\"",
      "The police statement said family members in India had \"expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalization, and that the son's apparent radicalization appeared \"to have no connection with India.\"",
      "Australian officials have confirmed that homemade ISIS flags were found \u2014   along with an improvised explosive device \u2014   in the suspects' vehicle at Bondi Beach on Sunday, and police provided new information on Tuesday about their recent movements.",
      "Suspected gunmen spent most of November in the Philippines",
      "Both men traveled to the Philippines in November, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters on Tuesday, adding that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went.",
      "The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said both Sajid Akram and his son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, spent most of November \u2014 from the 1st until the 28th \u2014   in the Philippines, and listing the city of Davao as their final destination.",
      "Muslim separatists, including the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group that once publicly backed ISIS, are active in that part of the southern Philippines. ABC, the Australian public broadcaster, said the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But Philippines presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "That group and others in the region have drawn and trained some foreign militants from across Asia, the Middle East and Europe in the past, according to the Associated Press, though Abu Sayyaf has been weakened in recent years by repeated military offensives.",
      "The AP cited Philippine military and police officials as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Did Australian officials fail the Jewish community?",
      "Australian officials confirmed Monday that Naveed Akram was under investigation for about six months during 2019 for suspected links to a Sydney-based terror cell, though the nation's primary spy agency found he represented no threat, and officials said the probe had focused on associates.",
      "Australia's ABC network\u00a0reported that his ties included \"longstanding links\" to members of a pro-ISIS cell in Australia, including contact with alleged jihadist spiritual leader Wisam Haddad and a man named Youssef Uweinat, who was convicted of recruiting young people in Australia to Islamic extremism.",
      "A lawyer for Haddad has denied that the cleric had \"any knowledge of or involvement in the shootings that took place at Bondi Beach,\" according to the network.",
      "Many people, from the daughter of one of the victims, to a former Australian leader, have told CBS News the men's history should have raised serious red flags, if not stopped them before they claimed so many lives.",
      "Israeli officials have harshly criticized Australia's government for failing to protect Jewish people amid a sharp rise in recent years of antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We are now facing here a surge of antisemitism, and Australians of Jewish faith are not feeling secure in their own country, and this is insane,\" Israeli Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon told CBS News on Tuesday, urging Australian leaders to create opportunities for young people of different faiths to come together, \"and not once a year, but on a weekly basis.\"",
      "Maimon also said \"boundaries should be set\" by Australian authorities, referring to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been held in the country.",
      "\"I believe that it's very important to make sure that while the principle of freedom of expression should be kept, there should be also a limit to the language that some protesters, and in some protests, we hear,\" he said. \"I always believe that there is room to do more. Always. I'm asking myself every day, 'what can I do better? How can I do better?' And I'm trying to do it. And I do expect the Australian government to do better.\"",
      "Former Australian leader says there are no easy answers",
      "Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told CBS News on Tuesday that the national government undoubtedly had some very big questions to answer, but he stressed that intelligence gathering \u2014 for all nations \u2014 is an imperfect science.",
      "\"This type of terrorism has been, the elements of that, have been present in Australia for a long time, and our agencies spend a lot of time keeping an eye on them, but it's hard to track every single person,\" said Turnbull, who was Australian prime minister from 2015 to 2018.",
      "\"Certainly, it's a very big question: Why does somebody living in the suburbs of Sydney need six long arms, as he [Sajid Akram] had, even though they were licensed? Second question is, why were they licensed to a man who had a son who had been on an ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organization] watchlist because of links to ISIS-related entities? \u00a0\u2026 And that trip to the Philippines raises another question: Why were they there? And so, you know, this gets back to the problem that I think we face all around the world, is databases talking to each other? Are we actually putting all the dots together in time?\"",
      "\"There are holes in everybody's intelligence gathering,\" Turnbull said. \"But as you know, the terrorist only has to be right once. The security agencies have to be right every time.\"",
      "Regarding the sharp criticism levelled by many in the Jewish community, in particular, over perceived failings in detecting the threat posed by the suspects, and also in sufficiently protecting the pre-planned Jewish event on Bondi Beach, Turnbull said he wasn't sure how much more could have been done by his successor Albanese.",
      "\"I've been prime minister, right? And I'm on the opposite side of politics, so I'm not trying to be partisan about this, but I struggle to see what he could have done that was different. I mean there have been people saying he shouldn't have allowed pro-Palestine marches. Well, you know, we do have freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Australia. I mean we have restrictions in Australia on speech, on hate speech, and on guns, in particular.\"",
      "\"When I ask people, they will say he should have condemned antisemitism more often. Well, I've never heard him do anything other than condemn it, but my question really is to say, what would difference would that have made? To those terrorists, you know, they're not going to listen to a lecture on the evils of antisemitism from you or me or Anthony Albanese.\"",
      "\"Remember, terrorism is a political act, right? So, you've got to try to interrupt people being radicalized, particularly young men, it's the most vulnerable group, and that involves monitoring what is being said online, what they're being taught, you know, in schools or in mosques or in other places. And the intelligence agencies are doing that all the time,\" he said.",

      "President Trump on Tuesday called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela, as the administration heaps pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro at sea and leaves the door open for possible land strikes.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment. The Pentagon referred CBS News to the White House.",
      "Last week, the U.S. military seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News. Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump's Tuesday night announcement suggests that further seizures are possible. It's not clear how many vessels are covered by the planned blockade.",
      "The Maduro government called last week's boat seizure \"robbery\" and \"piracy.\" In a statement late Tuesday, Venezuela called the blockade a \"grotesque threat\" and a violation of international law, and accused the Trump administration of seeking to \"appropriate the oil, land and minerals of the country through gigantic campaigns of lies and manipulations.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes any future boat seizures are unlikely to lead to increases in global oil prices, he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0over the weekend. He didn't specify whether a total blockade was on the table, but said the administration is trying to crack down on a \"black market for oil.\"",
      "Venezuela is a major oil producer with some of the world's largest petroleum reserves. But its oil industry has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for years, with the Biden and Trump administrations citing human rights concerns and widespread allegations of fraud in Venezuela's last two elections.",
      "Heavily sanctioned oil producers like Venezuela, Russia and Iran have sought to export their oil despite the U.S. restrictions, in some cases allegedly turning to a global \"shadow fleet\" of older oil tankers with questionable registrations \u2014 a move that has\u00a0vexed\u00a0federal authorities.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he has ramped up economic pressure on Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of colluding with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has denied those allegations.",
      "Last week, the administration sanctioned six ships accused of carrying oil from Venezuela, along with three nephews of Maduro, two of whom were accused of narcotics trafficking and one of whom worked for the country's state oil company.",
      "Late Tuesday, Mr. Trump alleged in a social media post that the Maduro regime was using oil exports to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration has\u00a0taken steps to designate the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a loosely organized group it says is led by Maduro \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization. And Maduro himself faces a $50 million reward for his capture, after he was\u00a0charged with narco-trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020.",
      "Venezuela has also faced pressure from the U.S. military, which has moved naval vessels and fighter jets into the Caribbean and conducted strikes against at least 25 boats it claims were trafficking drugs from Latin America.",
      "And Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested\u00a0he may order strikes on land-based drug targets in Venezuela and other countries, which would mark a significant escalation.",

    "summary": "From a diaper bank in South Carolina to a community clinic in Florida and a village in India, pregnant women are getting a healthier start thanks to free prenatal multivitamins from Vitamin Angels and its partners. Their stories reveal how targeted nutrition support can help moms carry to term and give babies a stronger beginning.",
    "story": [
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "While everyone\u2019s experiences and needs are different, and prenatals should be taken as a part of a healthcare provider\u2019s recommended prenatal care plan, Ty\u2019hara valued the healthy foundation they delivered during her pregnancy. The vitamins help the baby\u2019s organs \"function and form correctly,\" she said, \"as well as\u2026helping me with my iron and minerals and all the things that I need to support successful growth for her.\"",
      "Across the globe in India, a mom-to-be named Santoshini took Vitamin Angels supplements to round out her healthy routine. Like many of her neighbors, she got the vitamins free of charge from a program partner that collaborates with the Indian government to offer health education, childcare, immunizations, and more. \"I feel like these supplements help me get through the day without feeling tired,\" Santoshini said. That\u2019s important because, while she was pregnant, she also cared for her active\u00a0two-year-old son.",
      "Indeed, Vitamin Angels\u2019 impact goes far beyond underserved communities in the US to reach more than 74 million women and children annually in 65 countries worldwide. In low-resource areas, problems from insufficient nutrition from pregnancy until a child\u2019s fifth birthday can include additional and irreversible complications like blindness.",
      "But both at home and away, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a big difference. Case in point: A single dollar donation can impact four children;\u00a0$5 dollars reaches 20.",
      "\"Supporting moms during pregnancy is one of the smartest investments you can make,\"\u00a0Scott Minger, Vitamin Angels Chief Development Officer, said. \"For the cost of a few cups of coffee, we can provide a woman with a full course of prenatal multivitamins that help her stay healthy, carry to term, and welcome a stronger, healthier baby.\"",
      "Prevagen\u2019s leadership agrees the investment is well worth it, said Tom Dvorak, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Quincy Bioscience. \"At Prevagen, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Vitamin Angels allows us to transform that belief into meaningful action by supporting mothers and children with the essential nutrition they need to thrive.\"",

      "For others, the issue stems from neurobiological differences that affect how the brain manages time.",
      "Chronic lateness may not stem from poor planning, but from psychological and neurobiological factors. (iStock)",

      "A deadly insider attack that killed two U.S. service members in Syria is prompting fresh scrutiny of the Trump administration\u2019s counter-ISIS approach and its rapid embrace of Syria\u2019s new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "While Republican lawmakers largely urge a stronger campaign to contain ISIS, the shooting has exposed vulnerabilities inside Syria\u2019s fledgling security institutions and raised new questions about whether the U.S. can rely on Syrian forces as the administration seeks to stabilize the country.",
      "The incident has now become a flash point in a broader debate: whether the administration is underestimating ISIS\u2019s resilience, overestimating the reliability of Syria\u2019s fledgling institutions and potentially risking a withdrawal that could give the terror group room to rebound.",

      "Syrian officials say the gunman was part of the new post-Assad security apparatus and had been flagged internally for extremist leanings. He reportedly was in the process of being reassigned when he opened fire on American personnel, killing two service members and injuring an American civilian before being shot dead.",
      "The attack immediately raised questions about the strength of U.S.\u2013Syrian cooperation \u2014 a partnership that hinges on Washington\u2019s willingness to trust a government led by a man who was, until recently, a wanted terrorist himself. Trump officials have argued that al-Sharaa is essential to stabilizing Syria after Bashar al-Assad\u2019s downfall, but critics say the weekend shooting reveals glaring cracks in that strategy.",

      "Reed and others argue that the ambush underscores why a U.S. presence in Syria remains necessary despite political pressure from Trump\u2019s base to reduce deployments abroad.

      "\"There will undoubtedly be some calls from his base to bring troops home from Syria. He will need to resist those calls,\" Shapiro said in an email to Fox News Digital Monday. \"Leaving Syria when Syrian national forces are still finding their footing against ISIS and need support would almost certainly give ISIS more room to breathe.

      "Shapiro said that as the U.S. intensifies cooperation with Syrian national forces and the SDF, Syria will become increasingly dependent on U.S. intelligence to identify infiltrators or sympathizers within its ranks.",
      "Still, Shapiro warned that U.S. forces must remain cautious because the Syrian government\u2019s ability to follow through remains uncertain, and so the Syrian forces must prove themselves as trustworthy \u2014 or else sanctions that the Trump administration lifted in May could return, he said.",

      "How AI photo matching kept the search going",

      "She said, \"We went up and down the streets day and night. We went online in the neighborhood and on Love Lost. We put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Friends and neighbors were looking for him. I went to the animal shelter, posted him there, and went every day for over a month, hoping to find him.\"",
      "Pam uploaded Grayson's photo to Petco Love Lost right away. She checked her daily match alerts and hoped she would see his familiar face pop up. She told CyberGuy, \"I received match alerts almost every day from Lost Love, but never saw Grayson. His profile had been on their site for over 90 days.\"",
      "The moment everything changed",
      "Missy, a nearby resident, spotted a thin cat in an alley near her home. She brought him inside, took a picture of him and then turned to Love Lost to see if anyone had reported a missing cat like him.",
      "Missy explained how simple the process felt. \"I used Lost Love to reunite them,\" she said. \"I uploaded a photo of the cat that we found, and it was matched through AI with the photo that the owner uploaded.\"",
      "She soon received an AI match alert and learned that the cross street Grayson's owner, Pam, had listed in her lost post was only a mile from her home. Missy contacted Pam right away.",
      "That message changed everything. \"I am sure that if we had not posted his picture and enabled the ability to match the images, we would never have known what happened to Grayson,\" Pam said. \"And we would not have connected with Missy.\"",

      "Grayson is almost 12 and has never lived outdoors. That made this reunion feel even more emotional, Pam said.",
      "\"I am still amazed at Grayson's journey,\" she added. \"I look at him and cannot believe he made it through those 103 days. He is almost 12 years old, so he is not a young kitty.\"",
      "Pam said she still thinks about what those months were like for him. \"[I] guess I will always wonder where he was and how many stops he made before he reached Missy's loving home,\" she said. \"He must have known she would take care of him.

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

      "Recreational exoskeletons have been popping up for years, but the new IRMO M1 exoskeleton feels like a turning point. This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions. Early backers on its global crowdfunding campaign are already pushing the project toward major funding goals.",

      "How the IRMO M1 exoskeleton boosts your stride",
      "The M1 straps onto your waist and legs with modular fast-release bands. Each leg module weighs between 2.2 and 2.6 pounds. A 1,000 W motor provides up to 45% assist on each stride. IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",
      "Inside the frame sits a nine-axis IMU paired with an AI engine that studies your gait in real time. This lets the M1 fine-tune each push as it learns how you move. That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "How to buy the IRMO M1",
      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",
      "Since this is a crowdfunding project, you should review the refund rules, shipping details and risk notes before you back it.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you love the outdoors but feel the strain of long climbs or steep descents, this technology looks to help you reopen trails that once felt out of reach.

      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",

      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",

    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",

      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "Coaches can now review 3D bat paths and body sequencing using standard high-speed video. (Photo by Thien-An Truong/Getty Images)",
      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking. It reflects where the field as a whole is headed toward integrated markerless solutions that give athletes and coaches clearer insight with far less friction.\"",

But most of these headlines leave out important context that can help you breathe a little easier.",
      "First, smart home hacking is rare. Most incidents stem from weak passwords or from someone you already know, rather than from a stranger with advanced tools. Today's smart home brands push out updates to block intrusion attempts, including patches for new AI-related vulnerabilities that often make headlines.",

      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",

      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",
      "Steps to stay safe in your smart home",

      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A convincing layout doesn't mean it is legitimate. Always look at the domain name first. If it doesn't match the official site or uses odd spelling or extra characters, close it. Attackers rely on the fact that people recognize a page's design but ignore the address bar.",
      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

    "summary": "Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University designed a 21-foot dome that combines aquaculture and hydroponics to create a self-sustaining urban food system.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A futuristic food dome at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai offered a surprising look at how cities may grow fresh food close to home.",
      "Inspired by a classic greenhouse, the Inochi no Izumi or Source of Life dome showed how a compact closed-loop ecosystem could sit on rooftops or in small urban spaces. It looked like a tiny house full of produce powered by nature.",

      "LIVING IN GIANT MOON GLASS SPHERES COULD BE OUR FUTURE",
      "This dome creates a full food ecosystem by recycling water and nutrients in a closed loop. (VikingDome)",
      "Inside the Source of Life dome",
      "The 21-foot structure sits on a base with four water zones that support marine fish, brackish species and freshwater species. Their waste creates the nutrients that feed the plant layers above. Microbes convert ammonia into nitrates that plants love.",
      "Above the tanks are four hydroponic tiers. Salt-tolerant greens grow over the seawater tank. Tomatoes and semi-salt-tolerant veggies thrive in the brackish zone. Herbs and lettuce sit above freshwater species like sturgeon. Edible flowers fill the top layer where sunlight hits strongest. The layout functions like an ecological slice from ocean to land instead of floors.",
      "Transparent ETFE panels pull in light and help the dome keep a stable climate. Water pumps send nutrients upward and then return clean water to each tank. The loop creates almost no waste and keeps cycling with little input.",
      "BEEF INDUSTRY SLAMS LAB-GROWN HYBRID MEAT AS SCIENTISTS PROMISE GREENER STEAKS",
      "Plants grow in stacked hydroponic layers that match the salinity zones of the aquatic life below. (VikingDome)",
      "How cities may use systems like this",
      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",
      "Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology designed the system to copy nature. It follows the same recycling found in healthy wetlands. By letting biology do the work, the system reduces strain on land and water.",
      "The system shows how cities may produce fresh food on rooftops and small urban spaces. (VikingDome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This model hints at a future where fresh food sits closer to your kitchen. A dome like this could sit on an apartment building or a school and provide herbs, produce and edible flowers. It cuts travel time from farm to table and gives communities more control over their food supply.",
      "If a storm or disaster blocks access to farms, a closed-loop dome can keep growing. For people with tiny yards or no soil, it offers a realistic way to produce clean food in small spaces.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Source of Life dome may be a prototype, but it delivers a vivid preview of urban food production. It combines architecture, ecology and aquaculture in a compact package that uses every drop of water. If future cities adopt systems like this, access to fresh food could improve for millions.",

The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported 479 drone incidents at federal prisons in 2024, a substantial rise from 23 incidents in 2018. Unlike the federal government, states cannot shoot down a drone or jam its radio frequencies.",
      "Joel Anderson, director of South Carolina's Department of Corrections, said his team is leading the nation in developing drone detection systems. South Carolina reported 262 drone incursions over its prisons in 2022, up from 69 in 2019.",

      "Anderson has watched drone smuggling missions become more elaborate in recent years. When smugglers first went airborne, he said drones only carried about four pounds and reached a top speed of 45 miles per hour. Now, massive heavy-lift drones traveling more than 75 miles per hour are hauling 25-pound duffle bags of contraband over prison fences.",

      "Currently, detection and confiscation is all states can do when a drone flies over its prison. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits states from bringing down drones because they are considered registered aircraft.",
      "Anderson agreed that shooting down a drone could be dangerous for people inside and outside the prison because they often carry deadly drugs.",
      "\"We picked up enough fentanyl, one institution to kill the entire prison system one time.

      "Nuno F. Gomes Loureiro, 47, was a professor of nuclear science and engineering and the director of MIT\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center. Loureiro was a renowned figure in fusion-energy research, a field that seeks to recreate the power of the sun inside fusion reactors on Earth.

He also focused on plasma \u2014 a super-hot form of matter found in stars and in experimental fusion reactors.",

      "The Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK) report says this more than doubles the total of 975 executions that the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights counted in 2024. The U.N. noted that the 2024 figure was the highest recorded since 2015. The group counted a similar total of 1,001 executions in 2024.",
      "According to MEK documents provided to Fox News Digital, a free-falling Iranian currency, nationwide protests, factional power struggles, \"snapback\" U.N. sanctions and fractures among leaders are stoking the increase in executions.

Today, innocent civilians are being used as scapegoats for the regime\u2019s military and economic failures.\"",
      "The spokesperson continued, \"The Trump Administration restored the policy of maximum pressure, ending the Biden Administration\u2019s policy of announcing fig-leaf sanctions while handing the regime billions.\u00a0 Since January, we have designated dozens of people and over 180 vessels in Iran\u2019s shadow fleet to deplete the regime\u2019s coffers.\"",

He told Fox News Digital that the U.S. has \"been lagging behind\" other Western partners who have responded to Iranian human rights violations with sanctions and other measures, most recently Canada, which sanctioned four individuals after a protest in the Iranian city Mashhad in December.",
      "\"The lack of practical measures to support the Iranian people is a strategic own goal,\" Taleblu said.",

      "\"The imperative for Washington to support Iranian protesters\u2026 stands,\" Taleblu said. \"But that should be a constant in U.S. foreign policy, given the disposition of the Iranian street, which is almost entirely against the Iranian state.\u00a0U.S. human rights policy towards Iran should not be limited to merely having social media accounts that are the stenographers for Iran's decline into failed state status.\"",

      "For years, Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has defied predictions of collapse. Sanctions, diplomatic isolation and internal unrest have failed to unseat him. But the latest escalation by the Trump administration \u2014 including the seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker and the enforcement of a blockade on sanctioned vessels \u2014 has hit the regime where it is most vulnerable: its oil trade.",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that while the timeline and outcome remain uncertain, the regime\u2019s dependence on oil leaves it uniquely vulnerable. \"One thing is clear: the Maduro regime can\u2019t sustain itself without oil revenue,\" she said.",
      "While the U.S. move has raised concerns among European allies, who warned that the escalation could undermine regional stability and complicate efforts toward a political resolution in Venezuela, Ford Maldonado says the administration\u2019s approach is striking at the core of Maduro\u2019s power.",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Rich Edson joins \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 with details on President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming national address and his move to designate Nicolas Maduro's regime as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "The Trump administration has moved its hemispheric security doctrine into full force in Venezuela, ordering a sweeping naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers and labeling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 a dramatic escalation aimed at choking off the regime\u2019s primary source of revenue and confronting what the White House calls a growing threat of cartel-driven \"drug terrorism\" and foreign influence in the region.",
      "Announcing the move on social media, Trump said Venezuela was now \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America,\" a strike at an oil sector that accounts for roughly 88% of the country\u2019s export earnings.",
      "The administration\u2019s new National Security Strategy (NSS) places the Western Hemisphere at the center of U.S. national security planning, elevating regional instability, mass migration, cartels and foreign influence as direct challenges to American security. While the document does not single out Venezuela by name, its framework positions crises like Venezuela\u2019s collapse as central to protecting what the strategy calls America\u2019s \"immediate security perimeter.\"",
      "MADURO\u2019S FORCES FACE RENEWED SCRUTINY AS US TENSIONS RISE: \u2018A FORTRESS BUILT ON SAND\u2019",
      "According to the NSS, U.S. policy toward the hemisphere now focuses on preventing large-scale migration, countering \"narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations,\" and ensuring the region remains \"reasonably stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration.\" It also pledges to assert a \"Trump Corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine, aimed at blocking \"hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets\" by strategic competitors.",
      "A senior White House official said the Western Hemisphere chapter is designed to \"reassert American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere\" by strengthening regional security partnerships, curbing drug flows and preventing pressures that fuel mass migration. The official said the strategy situates the hemisphere as a foundational element of U.S. defense and prosperity.",
      "Newly released footage shows U.S. forces securing a Venezuelan oil tanker. (@AGPamBondi via X)",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the NSS reflects what the administration sees as a historic realignment of U.S. foreign policy. \"President Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy builds upon the historic achievements of his first year back in office, which has seen his Administration move with historic speed to restore American strength at home and abroad and bring peace to the world,\" Kelly told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"In less than a year, President Trump has ended eight wars, persuaded Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defense, facilitated U.S.-made weapons sales to NATO allies, negotiated fairer trade deals, obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, and more.\" The strategy, she added, is designed to ensure \"America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.\"",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, said Venezuela illustrates why the hemisphere is now treated as America\u2019s \"first line of defense.\"",
      "\"The Maduro regime functions as a narco-dictatorship closely tied to criminal cartels, which are now considered foreign terror organizations, and supported by China, Iran and Russia,\" she said. \"Confronting this criminal regime is about keeping poison off our streets and chaos off our shores.\"",

      "Roxanna Vigil, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the path ahead depends heavily on how forceful the administration\u2019s approach becomes. \"If it goes in the direction of escalation and conflict, that means there\u2019s going to be very little control,\" she said. \"If there is a power vacuum, who fills it?\"",

      "Jason Marczak, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, said the NSS underscores why the administration views Maduro\u2019s continued rule as incompatible with its regional priorities.",
      "\"All of those goals cannot be accomplished as long as Nicol\u00e1s Maduro or anybody close to him remains in power,\" he said, pointing to the strategy\u2019s focus on migration, regional security and countering foreign influence. \"Venezuela is a conduit for foreign influence in the hemisphere.\"",

      "Both Marczak and Vigil noted that the danger extends beyond Maduro to the criminal ecosystem and foreign partnerships that sustain his rule.

Within this framework, experts say the consequences of inaction could create security risks that extend well beyond Venezuela\u2019s borders.",

It highlights expanded counter-narcotics operations off Venezuela\u2019s coast, including airstrikes on maritime vessels linked to organizations such as Tren de Aragua and the National Liberation Army. The campaign, called Operation Southern Spear, is described as underscoring a commitment to \"defending the homeland from the influx of fentanyl and other illicit drugs ravaging American communities.\"",

In other cases, instructions are delivered remotely through secure channels that bypass standard telecommunications monitoring.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is leaving the possibility of a war with Venezuela on the table.",
      "\"I don\u2019t rule it out, no,\" he told NBC News in a phone interview.",
      "Trump on Tuesday ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers coming and going from Venezuela, increasing pressure on the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The U.S. recently seized an oil tanker captured near Venezuela, as well.",
      "The administration\u2019s campaign has already resulted in 28 boat strikes that have killed more than 100 people, including a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike facing congressional scrutiny.",
      "In his phone interview, Trump said \"I don't discuss it\" when he is asked whether he rules out the possibility that such actions could lead to war.",
      "But when he was pressed, he confirmed it was a possibility and said there will be additional seizures of oil tankers. Asked for a timeline, Trump replied: \"It depends. If they\u2019re foolish enough to be sailing along, they\u2019ll be sailing along back into one of our harbors.\"",
      "Trump also declined to say whether ousting Maduro was his ultimate goal.",
      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",
      "In his speech after he won the election, Trump said he was \"not going to start a war; I\u2019m going to stop wars.\"",
      "The administration has claimed that the strikes have been on alleged drug boats and that Venezuela is using oil revenue to finance \"drug terrorism.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump sought to defend his economic policies in a national prime-time address as voters continue to indicate that they're struggling with the cost of living.",
      "In the speech, Trump announced a $1,776 \u201cwarrior dividend\u201d that will go to nearly 1.5 million members of the military in honor of the nation\u2019s founding almost 250 years ago.",
      "Trump told NBC News that people would start getting the payments \"very soon\" \u2014 \"I would say within the next few days, it\u2019ll all be out\" \u2014\u00a0and said they will be funded through the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" and revenue from tariffs.",
      "\"We're making so much money with tariffs that we are able to do that and have plenty left over,\" he said.",
      "A senior administration official said the one-time bonus for troops will cost about $2.6 billion and be paid drawing from military housing funds from the One Big Beautiful Bill. The legislation, which Trump signed in July, allocated $2.9 billion to reduce the out-of-pocket cost for service members for two years.",
      "A Senate appropriations source also said that the money will come from there, not tariffs, and that the Defense Department decided instead to give the money as a one-time payment instead of creating a precedent for housing costs down the line.",
      "Trump also touched on health care in his remarks Wednesday night, blasting \"gigantic health insurance companies that have gotten rich on billions of dollars of money that should go directly to the people.\"",
      "He said people should be able to \"buy their own health insurance, which will give far better benefits at much lower cost. It will be far better health insurance.\"",
      "Millions of people who get coverage through the Affordable Care Act are set to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket next year, after House Republicans refused to call a vote this week to extend the subsidies.",
      "Trump said he doesn't believe it's necessary to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
      "\"I don\u2019t have to do anything, because Obamacare would just repeal itself automatically because nobody\u2019s going to want to use it. Too expensive,\" he told NBC News.",
      "He also said he has no plans to announce a broader health care plan.",
      "\"As far as I\u2019m concerned, I rolled it out last night,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s a very simple plan. The insurance companies have become totally rich and beyond any comprehension. They get billions and billions of dollars a year, and we\u2019re not going to let that happen.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay the money directly to the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can use health care accounts. They can use \u2014 you know, there are many ways of doing it, but we\u2019re going to let them buy their own health care. They\u2019ll get much better health care at a much lower price.\"",
      "A central focus for both parties next year will be November's midterm elections, with the Republicans cognizant that losing control of either chamber of Congress could lead to investigations and headaches for the White House.",
      "Asked whether he thinks Republicans will hold on to both chambers, Trump replied: \"I think so. I certainly hope so.\""

    "story": [
      "This article is part of \u201cPastors and Prey,\u201d a series investigating sex abuse allegations in the Assemblies of God.",
      "The policies sound simple: Mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse. Reference checks for all church staff and volunteers. Restrictions on who can use the title \u201cpastor\u201d to keep bad actors from operating under a cloak of authority.",
      "These are child safety measures that the Assemblies of God, the largest Pentecostal denomination in the world, has chosen not to require in the United States. Denomination leaders in the U.S. urge congregations to adopt child protection policies, but say they cannot force all 13,000 of their churches to comply.",
      "Halfway across the world in Australia, it\u2019s a different story.",
      "Amid a national reckoning over sex abuse a decade ago, Australia\u2019s largest Assemblies of God organization voted unanimously in 2015 to require that all affiliated churches adopt child protection policies.",
      "The safeguards that the U.S. denomination has rejected \u2014 saying they run counter to a religious structure grounded in local church autonomy \u2014 have now been implemented in Australia with the goal of keeping children safe.",
      "Ryan Beaty, a former Assemblies of God minister in Texas and Missouri, said the reforms in Australia demonstrate that the U.S. church could impose child safety rules without running afoul of core theology.",
      "\u201cCould they do it? Yes, I absolutely think they could do it. Would they do it? That\u2019s the real question in my mind,\u201d said Beaty, a communications professor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who studies religious institutions. \u201cAs of now, no Assemblies of God U.S. leaders are either willing or able to recognize that there is a problem that rises to the level of forcing a change.\u201d",
      "The approach in the U.S., where the global Assemblies of God movement was founded a century ago, has persisted despite decades of sexual abuse scandals and alleged cover-ups within the denomination\u2019s churches and efforts by survivors to push for change. An NBC News investigation identified about 200 Assemblies of God pastors, employees and volunteers accused of sexual abuse in the last 50 years. Some accused pastors were rehabilitated and moved to other positions of authority, freeing them to abuse again, the investigation found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just no oversight or accountability anywhere \u2014 it\u2019s up to each leader how they want to address it,\u201d said Jen Doyle, who says she was sexually abused by a worship leader in her Assemblies of God church in Pennsylvania in the late 1990s when she was 13. \u201cThe victims are the ones that are going to suffer the worst.\u201d",
      "\u2018Pastors and Prey\u2019: NBC News investigates sex abuse in Assemblies of God churches",

      "Part 4: Dozens of boys say they were abused in an Assemblies of God scouting program that vowed to raise godly men.",
      "The General Council of the Assemblies of God, the U.S. denomination\u2019s national governing body, responded to NBC News\u2019 reporting by stressing its commitment to child protection, including \u201cstringent standards\u201d and voluntary training that it recommends to all churches, along with background checks it requires for all credentialed pastors. The denomination\u2019s leaders argued that local church autonomy means instituting national standards is \u201cimpossible.\u201d",
      "When asked about Australia\u2019s approach, the General Council said the Assemblies of God\u2019s national church organizations around the world operate independently and sometimes adopt different rules and governing structures.",
      "Sex abuse cases have also surfaced in Assemblies of God churches in England, Nicaragua, Argentina and other countries; the church has nearly 90 million members worldwide. Nowhere, however, has the issue prompted as big of a national outcry \u2014 and an urgent call for action \u2014 as it did in Australia.",
      "The Assemblies of God took root in Australia nearly a century ago, and denomination leaders there also considered the autonomy of each church to be sacrosanct.",
      "Then came the backlash.",
      "Australian Christian Churches \u2014 the country\u2019s largest Assemblies of God\u2019s organization with more than 1,100 churches and 400,000 parishioners \u2014 was subject to an unprecedented national investigation into child sex abuse, prompted by mounting reports and allegations of cover-ups.",
      "Australia\u2019s Royal Commission, a government-appointed panel with broad investigative authority, led the inquiry, driven by the mishandling of child sex abuse in the Catholic Church. Its sweeping investigation, which was unveiled in 2012, expanded to cover other religious and secular institutions, including the Assemblies of God.",
      "The commission took evidence from 1,200 witnesses from 2013 to 2017, and aimed to determine the nature and cause of abuse and who should be held accountable. And while it could not dictate policy changes, it could force leaders into the national spotlight to explain what went wrong \u2014 and how they planned to fix it.",
      "Sen. David Shoebridge, an Australian legislator who was among those who called for the commission\u2019s creation, described it as an emergency measure.",
      "\u201cThe church was well aware of credible allegations of child sexual abuse \u2014 and yet instead of protecting survivors and potentially future victims, acted to protect the reputation of the church,\u201d Shoebridge said of Australian Christian Churches, pointing to church records and testimony. \u201cIt is a deep, deep betrayal of not just Christian values, but I think basic human values.\u201d",
      "One case caused an instant furor.",
      "The commission determined that a leading Assemblies of God pastor in Australia, Frank Houston, had sexually abused a 7-year-old boy decades earlier, and that when church leaders found out, they didn\u2019t report it to police. Instead, the leaders \u2014 including Houston\u2019s son, Brian Houston, the founder of the global megachurch Hillsong \u2014 allowed the pastor to quietly retire.",
      "For many within the Assemblies of God, it was the first time they\u2019d heard allegations that Frank Houston had committed crimes against children \u2014 and that his son, who was then president of the church\u2019s national organization, had failed to go to the authorities. (Brian Houston was later acquitted of a charge of criminally concealing his father\u2019s sex crimes after he said the victim in the case had asked him not to report it.)",
      "\u201cWe were gutted. We were gutted like a fish,\u201d said Bob Cotton, a former Assemblies of God pastor who leads a church in Maitland, Australia.",
      "The Royal Commission concluded in 2015 that the Assemblies of God had mishandled the Houston case and others like it. The commission faulted the denomination for failing to adopt necessary safety measures to prevent and respond to abuse \u2014 and for ultimately giving \u201cpriority to the protection of pastors over the safety of children.\u201d",
      "The commission singled out the church\u2019s decentralized structure.",
      "\u201cPerhaps the most significant factor that affected institutional responses to allegations of child sexual abuse was the autonomous nature of Pentecostal churches, which meant that senior pastors had discretion about whether to adopt child protection policies, including in relation to the training, supervision and discipline of staff,\u201d the commission said in its final report.",
      "In their defense, top church officials had argued during public hearings that the Australian Christian Churches was fundamentally a \u201cfellowship of autonomous independent churches,\u201d and that the national organization had no authority to require individual churches to follow specific policies \u2014 the same defense used by leaders in the U.S.",
      "But the prominence and power of Australia\u2019s Royal Commission put enormous pressure on Australian Christian Churches, among other denominations, to make internal reforms.",
      "In 2017, the leaders of Australian Christian Churches returned to testify before the commission. This time, they acknowledged the shortcomings of the denomination\u2019s child protection policies \u2014 and described a big change.",
      "\u201cWe did a lot of soul searching,\u201d pastor Wayne Alcorn, the denomination\u2019s national president at the time, told the Royal Commission. \u201cWe realized that many things that we were asking of our churches were recommended. Now they are no longer recommended \u2014 they are required. And, really, that was the primary thing.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Australian Christian Churches said it is \u201ccommitted to ensuring all aspects of church ministry to be safe.\u201d",
      "The group still considers itself to be a \u201cvoluntary cooperation\u201d of self-governing churches. At the same time, all affiliated churches must adopt its minimum child protection policies, including requirements to report suspected abuse and for all staff members and volunteers to undergo reference checks.  The group\u2019s new national office and state offices for church safety oversees these policies.",
      "\u201cThe way we\u2019ve written the ACC policy is to say, \u2018Here\u2019s what you will need to adhere to,\u2019\u201d said Peter Barnett, director of Creating Safer Communities, an independent child protection organization that Australian Christian Churches hired to help draft and implement the changes, and that now operates the group\u2019s hotline for reporting safety concerns. \u201cEach local church has to actually sign off that they will do that.\u201d",
      "The denomination also now requires \u201canyone referred to as a Pastor\u201d to be credentialed by Australian Christian Churches, a process requiring criminal background and reference checks. In the U.S., each Assemblies of God church\u2019s senior pastor must be similarly vetted and credentialed, but youth pastors, worship leaders and other associate ministers are not required to receive the same level of scrutiny from the national organization.",
      "Many Australian survivors and advocates believe that the changes don\u2019t go far enough.",
      "Critics point out that there is little way to know if churches are actually following the rules. Australian Christian Churches doesn\u2019t have a formal audit process; the denomination didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether any noncompliant pastors or churches had been expelled.",
      "\u201cThe mice are still in charge of the cheese,\u201d said Cotton, the former Assemblies of God pastor, who left the denomination over its mishandling of child sexual abuse.",
      "And just like in the U.S., some abuse survivors in Australia say they feel betrayed by church leaders who have fought efforts to seek accountability and compensation.",
      "Peter Townsend, who was sexually abused in the 1970s by an Assemblies of God youth pastor and Royal Rangers scouting leader when he was about 12, helped send his abuser to prison in 2017. But when he sued Australian Christian Churches two years later, the denomination denied it was liable, arguing that it had no control over its member churches when the abuse occurred.",
      "\u201cThey pushed me under the bus and watched the bus run over me,\u201d said Townsend, whose lawsuit was unsuccessful.",
      "Still, the Australian denomination has done more than U.S. Assemblies of God leaders have been willing to do.",
      "In 2019 and 2021, the General Council of the Assemblies of God in the U.S. considered a similar proposal to require churches to adopt child safety policies. But when it came time to vote, church leaders objected.",
      "The measure would play \u201cright into the hands of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u201d and expose the church to greater liability if victims sued, General Secretary Donna Barrett said in 2021. The General Council declined to adopt the measure.",
      "Beaty, the former Assemblies of God minister, said the decision reflected an unspoken belief among senior church leaders: that the institution\u2019s well-being comes before all else.",
      "\u201cIf the Assemblies of God falters, people go to hell,\u201d Beaty said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they believe. And they will sacrifice some members to protect that mission.\u201d"

President Donald Trump repeatedly delayed the ban, which was supposed to take effect in January. In September, Trump signed an executive order facilitating a TikTok deal that could transfer majority ownership of the app to Americans. But its fate was largely still up in the air, until Thursday.",
      "By showtime, the platform\u2019s tumultuous year already seemed to be a thing of the past. Audience members mingled with the nominees and nibbled on hors d\u2019oeuvres such as caviar on fried chicken and matcha-flavored petit fours.

      "Director James Cameron has in the past promised two more \u201cAvatar\u201d movies are yet to come.",
      "But in a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Dec. 17, Cameron said moving forward with the final two films, whose budgets would be as enormous as the first three movies, depends on the box-office success of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis can be the last one. There\u2019s only one (unanswered question) in the story. We may find that the release of \u2018Avatar 3\u2019 proves how diminished the cinematic experience is these days, or we may find it proves the case that it\u2019s as strong as it ever was \u2014 but only for certain types of films,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a coin toss right now,\u201d added Cameron. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until the middle of January.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the possible final two installments in the \u201cAvatar\u201d franchise.",
      "What Is the 'Avatar' Franchise About?",
      "The sci-fi franchise, created by Cameron, tells the story of a group of humans in the antagonistic Resources Development Administration (RDA) who clash with indigenous humanoid called the Na\u2019vi after greedily colonizing their moon Pandora to mine a valuable mineral.",
      "The franchise\u2019s long arc also features an unlikely love story between a human, Jake Sully, played by Worthington, and the Na\u2019vi warrior Neytiri, played by Salda\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d introduces a new oceanic Na\u2019vi tribe, the Metkayina clan, who live on Pandora\u2019s reefs, as well as new sea creatures like the whale-like Tulkuns. In \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d viewers get to meet the Mangkwan clan, also known as the Ash People, who are led by their wicked leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin.",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 4\u2019 Be Released?",
      "The year delay in the release of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d pushed back the release dates of the franchise\u2019s final two movies, Deadline reported in June 2023.",
      "\u201cAvatar 4,\u201d which was originally scheduled for a December 2026 release, will now arrive in theaters in December 2029, according to Deadline.",
      "But, as Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this week, he hopes the just-released \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d is another box-office smash in order for him to continue with the franchise.",
      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,\u201d he said.",
      "During a 2023 appearance on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace,\u201d Cameron confirmed he\u2019d already begun working on both final films.",
      "\u201c\u2018Avatar 4\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 are both written. We even have some of \u20184\u2019 in the can,\u201d said Cameron.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun a franchise at this point,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can safely say we\u2019ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films, which was our original goal.\u201d",
      "When Wallace asked if Cameron already knew the final scene of the entire franchise, Cameron responded, \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s all been written. The scripts for 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all finished over five years ago. It\u2019s all mapped out.\u201d",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 5\u2019 Be Released?",
      "\u201cAvatar 5,\u201d which was originally intended to arrive in theaters in December 2028, is now set for a December 2031 release, reported Deadline.",
      "How Will the 'Avatar' Story End?",
      "As far as how the franchise\u2019s story will wrap up, producer Jon Landau dropped a bombshell about the plot of \u201cAvatar 5,\u201d during a 2022 conversation with Gizmodo\u2019s io9 blog.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk about it, but I\u2019ve now subsequently heard that Jim (Cameron) has talked about it a little bit,\u201d Landau said. \u201cIn movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people\u2019s eyes, open Neytiri\u2019s eyes, to what exists on Earth.\u201d",
      "The journey, said Landau, will illustrate to the Na\u2019vi that the colonizing humans in the Resources Development Administration don\u2019t represent all humans.",
      "\u201cEarth is not just represented by the RDA,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like you\u2019re defined by the choices you make in life, not all humans are bad. Not all Na\u2019vi are good. And that\u2019s the case here on Earth. And we want to expose Neytiri to that.\u201d"

Alas, he learned that she wasn\u2019t meeting with anyone before or after the show in an effort to conserve her voice for the concert, which lasted over three hours.",

The Ash People come in handy when the big war rages.",

At one point, Spider is thrown into the middle of their fight. He slips and is at risk of falling to his death. Quaritch attempts to save him but also puts himself in danger \u2014 and Jake helps save them both. The encounter seems to draw them all to a truce.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "Jelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "Jelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion",
      "Lee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.",
      "Much of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" about someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview. \"By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I'm not telling my story anymore. I'm getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story's never been told.\"",
      "Jelly Roll: 'I was a part of the problem'",
      "Before the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Outside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Sheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon",
      "Friends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "\"I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that's not just words,\" Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I'm talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor."

      "Warning; Major spoilers ahead for the \u201cSurvivor\u201d Season 49 finale\u2026",
      "In a teaser for the \u201cSurvivor\u201d Season 49 finale, host Jeff Probst said, \u201cThis has been one of the most unpredictable games we have ever seen.\u201d But did the five remaining castaways deliver an epic ending to the season?",
      "When the three-hour Season 49 finale began on Wednesday, Dec. 17, there were five contestants hoping to win the title of \u201csole \u2018Survivor\u2019\u201d and the $1 million prize: Kristina Mills, Rizo Velovic, Sage Ahrens-Nichols, Savannah Louie and Sophi \"Soph\" Balerdi.",
      "The final five still had a couple Immunity Challenges, the controversial Fire-Making Challenge and Final Tribal Council to get through before the jury voted for a winner. Plus, the after show revealed which two castaways will return for the historic Season 50, arriving Wednesday, Feb. 25,  2026.",
      "Read on to find out everything that happened in the Season 49 finale, including who was crowned the winner, below.",
      "1st  Immunity Challenge",
      "After Soph found an advantage in the jungle to help her in the Immunity Challenge, she learned from Probst at the challenge that half of her puzzle pieces were already placed in the correct spots. But Soph instantly fell behind during the first portion of the challenge and struggled to crawl through the mud.",
      "Meanwhile, Savannah sped through nearly every portion and quickly completed the puzzle, giving her a record-tying fourth Immunity Challenge win and guaranteeing her a spot in the final four.  She also won the reward and chose to take Sage to the Sanctuary to enjoy steak and potatoes.",
      "In her confessional, Savannah smiled wide as she celebrated her win and pointed out how she has been able to outlast her foes all season long.",
      "1st Tribal Council",
      "Back at camp, Kristina \u2014 who assumed Savannah, Soph and Rizo would vote together given that they've been a strong trio for most of the game \u2014 pitched voting out Sage to Soph and Rizo. During the reward meal, Sage suggested to Savannah that the better move was to vote out Kristina since she could beat anyone in the Fire-Making Challenge. Thus, the Tres Leches alliance was at a stalemate going into Tribal Council.",
      "After a back-and-forth between Kristina and Sage at Tribal Council where they both explained why the other was a threat, it was time to vote. Rizo \u2014 who had been holding onto his Hidden Immunity Idol for a record nine Tribal Councils \u2014 finally played his idol for himself before the votes were read.",
      "Probst read the votes and revealed Kristina as the 14th person voted out and seventh member of the jury.",
      "2nd Immunity Challenge",
      "Following an interruption due to an address from President Trump, the show picked up at the second and final Immunity Challenge of the night.",
      "The final four were neck and neck as they reached the final portion of the challenge. Soph pulled out a comeback victory and received her first Immunity Challenge win of the season.",
      "\"Oh my God, this is a dream!\" she said when Probst placed the necklace around her neck.",
      "Fire-Making Challenge",
      "As the winner, Soph had to choose which person to take to the end with her and which two castaways had to face off in the Fire-Making Challenge. She told the other three that they should practice while she contemplated her decision, adding that she didn't want them to plead their cases.",
      "In a confessional, Savannah said she felt betrayed by her \"best friend\" Soph for not instantly wanting to save her. Rizo tried to remain optimistic and said he had more experience making fire compared to Savannah and Sage. Sage also had a positive mentality as she prepared, telling herself that whatever was meant to happen would happen.",
      "At Tribal Council, Probst said Soph's choice could be a $1 million decision. She announced that she wanted to take Sage to the final three and have her two allies, Savannah and Rizo, make fire to earn the last spot.",
      "While Rizo struggled and repeatedly smothered his fire, Savannah nurtured a strong fire that continued to grow until it burned through the rope, making her the winner.",
      "Rizo became the eighth and final member of the jury. Before leaving, Rizo shared some emotional departing words. \"For a little Albanian boy from New York City... to say I have no regrets, to say I made my family proud, to say I made a whole country proud, I truly feel like I left an impact on this game.\"",
      "He asked to be called by his nickname, \"Riz God,\" as Probst snuffed his torch.",
      "Final Tribal Council",
      "As their final breakfast arrived at camp, Savannah, Sage and Soph reflected on being the first all-female final three in 20 seasons. They also shared some of their favorite moments with each member of the jury.",
      "Next, it was time for Final Tribal Council to begin. Rizo kicked things off by sharing kind words for the three ladies. The remaining members of the jury then posed questions that allowed each finalist to elaborate on their strategies and how they outwitted, outlasted and outplayed everyone else.",
      "When asked to name her most strategic move, Soph said she built strong connections outside of her trio that helped her social game. Savannah recalled a conversation with jury member Sophie Segreti where she pitched working together. Sage mentioned her move to vote out Sophie over Savannah.",
      "For their final pitches, Soph noted that she had been to 12 Tribal Councils and voted out more people than anyone else. Savannah said she successfully dodged the most bullets because she was adaptable, prioritized key relationships and dominated in Immunity Challenges. Sage said she had an important social component to her game that worked hand in hand with her strategic game, allowing her to build close friendships.",
      "And the Winner Is\u2026",
      "\"The jury has made their decision. I'll read the votes,\" Probst said. After three votes were revealed, each woman had a vote each. But as he continued to read the votes, Savannah's name appeared again and again. Savannah was crowned the winner of Season 49.",
      "The cast all toasted with champagne as Probst kicked off the after show.",
      "After Show and Final \u2018Survivor\u2019 Season 50 Contestants Revealed",
      "During the after show, Savannah said she felt \"imposter syndrome\" the whole season and it was a \"larger than life feeling\" to win the game. \"I don't even know what to say because I've never experienced anything like this before. It's a crazy feeling,\" she added.",
      "In the final moments of the episode, Probst introduced the first trailer for \"Survivor\" Season 50. At the start of the clip, the host is shown speaking to all the returning players. He tells them he expects them all to give \"everything\" they have to win.",
      "The chaotic trailer also mentioned that Zac Brown, Billie Eilish, Jimmy Fallon and MrBeast will impact the game in some way.",

      "The administration\u2019s campaign has already resulted in 28 boat strikes that have killed more than 100 people, including a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike facing congressional scrutiny.",
      "In his phone interview, Trump said \"I don't discuss it\" when he is asked whether he rules out the possibility that such actions could lead to war.",
      "But when he was pressed, he confirmed it was a possibility and said there will be additional seizures of oil tankers. Asked for a timeline, Trump replied: \"It depends. If they\u2019re foolish enough to be sailing along, they\u2019ll be sailing along back into one of our harbors.\"",

      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",
      "In his speech after he won the election, Trump said he was \"not going to start a war; I\u2019m going to stop wars.\"",

      "For the second year in a row, North Korea\u2019s vast cryptocurrency hacking operation has broken its own record, stealing $2.02 billion in 2025, new research says.",
      "A report published Thursday by the blockchain watchdog company Chainalysis found that North Korea broke its own record of $1.3 billion in hacked and stolen crypto like bitcoin and ethereum. That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",
      "A significant chunk of that comes from the hack of the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit this year. The hackers \u2014 who worked for North Korea\u2019s elite government hacking squad, according to the U.S. Secret Service \u2014 stole around $1.5 billion, mostly in ethereum, in February, Bybit\u2019s CEO said.",
      "Chainalysis is one of a growing number of companies that map out the sprawling network of cryptocurrency transactions, including tracing hacked funds as they\u2019re laundered by criminals.",
      "The United Nations and private researchers have long accused North Korea, which is beset by international sanctions and has relations with only a handful of countries, of deploying its hackers to steal cryptocurrency to help fund its nuclear weapons and missile programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to stop, because there\u2019s an asymmetry where they\u2019re in general so cut off from the world and such a rogue state,\u201d said Matt Pearl, the director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security think tank.",
      "Part of the theft is most likely due to the increasingly common phenomenon of North Korean hackers\u2019 fraudulently obtaining remote technical jobs with international companies, the report said. That access can put them in positions to give their hacker colleagues a foothold to steal cryptocurrency keys and wire crypto to Pyongyang.",
      "There are scattered incidents of other countries\u2019 professional hackers\u2019 stealing large amounts of money. The Secret Service previously linked Chinese government hackers to an operation that stole U.S. Covid relief benefits, and the U.S. and U.K. governments have accused some financially motivated Russian cybercriminals of ties to the Kremlin.",
      "But no country has an alleged operation like North Korea\u2019s, whose hackers working directly for the government routinely steal such large sums from companies around the world.",
      "Leaked documents have previously shown that North Korea has deployed some of the most sophisticated international money laundering operations on the planet.",
      "Crypto is also generally much easier to launder at a large scale than traditional currency. Exchanges often hold it in vast sums, making them extremely ripe targets for North Korea.",
      "Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets, or accounts that can be accessed with private keys, and it remains the case that if hackers gain control of an account, they can quickly wire it to a different wallet that they own. Unlike with traditional finance, there are few ways to reverse a fraudulent transaction.",
      "\u201cDespite their institutional resources and professional security teams, these platforms remain vulnerable because of this fundamental security challenge,\u201d the Chainalysis report found.",
      "Pearl said that given that North Korea is already under extreme sanctions, there\u2019s little left to deter it from continuing to hack digital assets to fund its military operations.",
      "\u201cObviously, the traditional tools we have had have not worked,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to continue to see this.\u201d"

      "\u201cThe Americans are trying to find a compromise,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday. \u201cThey are proposing a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\u201d",

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sound of gentle singing filled the air on Bondi Beach, the site of Australia's deadliest shooting in almost three decades.",
      "Alon Meltzer, 37, an associate rabbi at the nearby Mizrachi Synagogue, was among those who on Monday sang Hebrew prayers about fellowship, compassion and mercy near the place where two attackers targeted a Hanukkah celebration a day earlier. Officials have designated the incident \u201cantisemitic terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole world feels narrow, dark and turbulent, but have no fear,\u201d Meltzer said, describing one of the prayers.",
      "Meltzer and his wife, 41-year-old social worker Simonne Turner, who were at Bondi Beach with their three children, lost friends in the Sunday attack in Sydney, which killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more.",
      "A 10-year-old girl, a former police officer, a Holocaust survivor and two rabbis were among those killed in the attack, which officials said targeted Jewish people at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.",
      "Police identified the two suspects as a father and son, ages 50 and 24. Officers fatally shot the 50-year-old at the scene, while the 24-year-old \u201csuffered critical injuries\u201d and remains hospitalized.",
      "For Australians, the overwhelming feeling is shock. After a 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur that killed 35 people, the country overhauled its gun laws precisely to prevent such an attack from ever happening again. According to police, who seized three firearms and two improvised explosive devices from the scene at Bondi Beach, the 50-year-old suspect was a licensed firearms holder who owned six firearms.",
      "There is also anger. Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitism fueled in part by Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and local Jewish groups have criticized what they see as a lack of support from authorities."

      "For the past couple of years, leaders in Australia\u2019s Jewish community have been seeing a rise in antisemitism and urging the country\u2019s leaders to act.",
      "But Australia, like other countries grappling with a resurgence of what\u2019s been called the \u201coldest hatred\u201d since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, has been slow to react to the threat, Jewish leaders said Monday.",
      "The country saw its deadliest mass killing in nearly 30 years, with the massacre of 15 people this past weekend during a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen every manner of exclusion, abuse, attack, harassment, threats, fire bombings, burning of synagogues,\u201d said Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \u201cThis country has changed fundamentally in two years, and it\u2019s culminated now on the beach.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath of the shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his National Cabinet vowed Monday to eradicate the \u201cevil scourge\u201d of antisemitism and take other steps like further tightening the country\u2019s already stringent gun control measures and establishing a centralized National Hate Crimes and Incidents Database.",
      "Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said Albanese and the Australian government have, thus far, been \u201call talk and no action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the first incident of this kind in Australia, just the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWarm words of embrace are just not going to cut it. We\u2019re looking for action, changes of policies.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Menachem Gluckowsky, the deputy chief justice of the Chabad Rabbinical Court in Israel, echoed Cooper.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call for Australia for sure,\u201d Gluckowsky said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call for all countries. This is not just our battle. It\u2019s not just a battle for the Jewish people. This is a battle on evil. Just because you feel you\u2019re right, you can\u2019t gun down people cold bloodedly.\u201d",
      "Gluckowsky likened the Bondi Beach attack to the pogroms that European Jews endured for centuries. He said governments worldwide, and especially in the West, have been slow to respond to rising anti-Jewish hatred.",
      "Both Gluckowsky and Cooper contend that pro-Palestinian demonstrations have fanned the flames of antisemitism. And Australia\u2019s decision in September to formally recognize a Palestinian state was a \u201csignal\u201d to terrorists determined to attack Jews, Cooper said.",
      "\u201cThey have allowed Jews to twist in the wind,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday, Albanese was asked whether he saw any link between the recognition of a Palestinian state and the Bondi shooting.",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And overwhelmingly, most of the world recognizes a two-state solution as being the way forward in the Middle East,\u201d the prime minister said.",
      "\u201cMy job is to provide support for the Jewish community, is to make it clear that Australians overwhelmingly stand with the Jewish community at this difficult time,\u201d he added in response to a follow-up question.",
      "Cooper\u2019s denunciation came a day after a father-son terror team opened fire on a Hanukkah celebration taking place on the iconic beach. The 50-year-old father died at the scene. His 24-year-old son remained in a coma in a hospital on Monday, officials said.",
      "So far, Australian officials have not released their names or divulged a motive. But since the Israeli-Hamas war erupted two years ago, Australian lawmakers and experts have reported a surge in antisemitic incidents.",
      "The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people in Israel, and the Israeli military response led to the death of over 70,000 in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d an Australian parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism concluded in October 2024.",
      "Earlier this month, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry reported 1,654 anti-Jewish incidents across the country between Oct. 1, 2024, and Sept. 30, 2025.",
      "There were 2,062 such incidents the year before, an all-time high for Australia, the organization reported.",
      "Homes, cars and schools were vandalized with anti-Israel messages. A synagogue and childcare center were targeted by arsonists. Two nurses were suspended for posting online that they would kill or not treat Jewish patients.",
      "And police in January foiled what they said was an antisemitic plot when officers seized a travel trailer packed with explosives.",
      "Most of the threats were reported in Sydney and Melbourne, which are Australia\u2019s biggest cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population of around 117,000.",
      "Previously, Australian lawmakers responded to the threats by passing tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "Now they\u2019re looking into tightening Australia\u2019s gun laws to make it harder for residents to get their hands on the kind of high-powered rifles and shotguns that were reportedly used Sunday to stain the sands of Bondi Beach with blood.",
      "Antisemitism online has also spiked in recent years, fueled by anger around the conflict between Israel and Hamas and enabled by a new freewheeling social media landscape where content moderation on sites like X and others has been loosened.",
      "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches misinformation and extremism, found a 4,963% increase in the number of antisemitic YouTube comments on conflict-related videos, compared to the days before the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "For months after the incident, the institute found that fringe platforms like 4chan, Bitchute, Gab and Telegram saw a 50% increase in daily antisemitic comments made.",
      "Sunday\u2019s shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in Australia since April 1996, when a gunman armed with two semi-automatic weapons went on a rampage in the tourist town of Port Arthur, on the island of Tasmania, that left 35 dead and 23 wounded.",
      "That bloodletting resulted in legislation that banned ownership of most automatic and semiautomatic rifles and drastically reduced the number of mass killings in Australia.",
      "Growing emotional, Gluckowsky said they are \u201cgoing to stand strong and carry on\u201d despite what happened on Bondi Beach.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t be intimidated or inhibited of who we are as Jews,\u201d he said.",
      "Matt Bradley reported from Israel and Ben Goggin and Corky Siemaszko from New York City."
