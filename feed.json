      "Australian senators have voted to censure an Indigenous colleague who yelled at King Charles III during a reception in Parliament House last month",
      "CANBERRA, Australia -- Australian senators on Monday voted to censure an Indigenous colleague who yelled at King Charles III during a reception in Parliament House last month.",
      "The censure of independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe is a symbolic gesture that records her colleagues\u2019 disapproval of her conduct during the first visit to Australia by a British monarch in 13 years.",
      "The motion was carried 46 votes to 12.",
      "Government leader in the Senate Penny Wong said Thorpe\u2019s outburst sought to \u201cincite outrage and grievance.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is part of a trend that we do see internationally which, quite frankly, we do not need here in Australia,\u201d Wong told the Senate.",
      "Thorpe launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles following his speech during his visit to Canberra and Sydney.",
      "\u201cYou are not our king. You are not sovereign,\u201d Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception.",
      "\u201cYou committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\u201d she added.",
      "Following her censure, Thorpe said she would repeat her rant if Charles returned.",
      "\u201cIf the colonizing king were to come to my country again, our country, then I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Thorpe told reporters.",
      "\u201cAnd I will keep doing it. I will resist colonization in this country. I swear my allegiance to the real sovereigns of these lands; First Peoples are the real sovereigns. You don\u2019t have some random king rock up and say he\u2019s sovereign,\u201d she added.",
      "Sen. Mehreen Faruqi, a member of the minor Greens party, opposed the censure motion.",
      "\u201cThe bubble of white privilege that encapsulates this parliament is a systemic issue,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here today, debating a Black senator being censured for telling the truth of the British crown\u2019s genocide on First Nations people and telling it the way she wants to.\"",
      "The vote took place before Thorpe arrived on a flight from Melbourne. Thorpe said she had wanted to be in Parliament for the vote but government senators refused to wait.",
      "Indigenous people account for fewer than 4% of Australia's population and are the nation's most disadvantaged ethnic group."

      "In 1970, after fighting in Vietnam, young Walt Longmire took a job working security for an oil company in Alaska",
      "In December, 1970, Walt Longmire, back in the States after fighting in Vietnam, was working security for an oil company on Alaska\u2019s North Slope. There, he found himself battling predators, both animal and human, in brutal weather conditions.",
      "Now, after his career as sheriff of fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming, comes to an end, Longmire tells the decades-old tale to a friend. The result is \u201cTooth and Claw,\u201d the second short novel (the other being \u201cFirst Frost,\u201d published last May) in which Craig Johnson adds flesh and muscle to the back story of a character featured in 21 novels and the TV series \u201cLongmire\u201d that spanned six seasons on A&E and Netflix.",
      "The action begins when Longmire accompanies U.S. Geological Survey researchers on a flight to a remote pack of frozen sea ice. Things go bad from the start when an enormous polar bear kills and eats a member of the team. Then it gets worse.",
      "A sudden blizzard forces the team to seek shelter in their small plane. Plunging temperatures cause equipment, including some of their weapons, to malfunction. Powerful winds tear the plane from its moorings and send it skittering upside down across the ice. The ice cracks, threatening to drop the plane into the sea. And the bear, whose white coat makes him all but impossible to see in the landscape of snow and ice, is still hunting them.",
      "The crew sees salvation in the form of a ship\u2019s hull in the near distance, but when they flee from the plane and scramble aboard, they discover that it is the SS Baychimo, a legendary ghost ship that has been floating around the Arctic since it was abandoned by its crew in 1931.",
      "They gather in the captain\u2019s quarters, find coal to burn in a stove to keep from freezing to death, and struggle to get the ship\u2019s ancient radio working so they can summon help. But before long, they discover they are not alone. The bear found the ship first and has made it his home.",
      "Meanwhile, the storm and the bear are not their only problems. A few greedy members of the research team have a secret agenda that puts Longmire in further peril.",
      "The action is non-stop in this suspenseful tale of man against nature, and the writing is so tight that the author packs more into 180 pages than many writers squeeze into 300.",

    "story": [
      "The Associated Press says it is looking to cut 8% of its workforce, primarily through buyouts, and employees eligible to leave their jobs would begin getting notifications",
      "The Associated Press said Monday that it would begin offering buyouts and lay off selected employees, part of a plan to reduce the news outlet's staff by about 8% and accelerate a transition to a digital-first organization.",
      "The move is part of what is expected to be a dispiriting end-of-year period in the news industry, which is beset by business woes that go back years. The end of a busy presidential-election cycle was also expected to accelerate reorganization plans.",
      "The AP said those eligible for buyouts were to learn of the offer, which would include severance pay and partial health coverage for 18 months, by the end of Monday. Those whose positions are due to be eliminated would learn about their fates over the next few weeks.",
      "Once considered the world's largest newsgathering organization, the AP no longer makes that claim and does not reveal the size of its staff. As a result, it was impossible to say on Monday how many people would be affected. The AP said less than half of the anticipated cuts would involve its news employees, with the bulk happening within the United States.",
      "The News Media Guild said that 121 of its members would be offered buyouts. The AP, without giving an estimate, said there would be fewer job cuts than that among the union members.",
      "For years, news executives have had to make cutbacks because solutions to their business problems have proven elusive, said Gabriel Kahn, who helps run the media, economics and entrepreneurship program at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. It has become even tougher in the past couple of years as the work of journalists has become much less visible on social media, due to changes in search algorithms and artificial intelligence, he said.",
      "\u201cThey've pulled the plug out of the bathtub and we're watching the water going down the drain,\u201d Kahn said.",
      "The AP, which prides itself on being an unbiased news source, offers news stories, pictures, video, audio and interactive content direct to consumers via the website apnews.com. But the bulk of its business comes from selling its journalism to other news organizations that use it.",
      "Earlier this year, two major news chains, Gannett and McClatchy, said they would stop buying news from AP, in Gannett's case ending a relationship that had lasted more than a century. The AP has diversified its revenue stream in recent years, including accepting philanthropic funding, but is still hurt by the news industry's overall woes.",
      "\u201cWe all know this is a time of transformation in the media sector,\u201d Daisy Veerasingham, AP's president and CEO, said in a note to staff members sent early Monday morning. \u201cOur customers \u2014 both who they are and what they need from us \u2014 are changing rapidly. This is why we've focused on delivering a digital-first news report. We now need to accelerate on this path.\u201d",
      "In broad strokes, that means an increased emphasis on visual journalism \u2014 photos and video and the digital content that incorporates them into storytelling.",
      "Veerasingham was not available for an interview, an AP spokeswoman said.",
      "AP remains a central part of the news industry's ecosystem, particularly when it comes to U.S. elections. During its election coverage earlier this month, the AP had unprecedented usage of its live video, election data, visuals and interactive products, Veerasingham said.",
      "The AP said it had reached a tentative deal with its union to offer the buyouts, but that is subject to ratification by its members. \u201cSadly, it is apparently what is needed,\u201d said Vin Cherwoo, president of the News Media Guild. \u201cThey've been seeking revenue for awhile and have had difficulty getting it.\u201d",
      "Cherwoo said it's unfortunate what is going on, but that \u201ceveryone can see what is going on at other news organizations across the country.\"",

      "Nearly 35 years later \u2014 and just before the acclaimed audio engineer died in May at age 61 \u2014 Deal turned to Albini once again for what would be their final collaboration, this time for another debut. Eight of the 11 tracks on Deal\u2019s first solo studio album, \u201cNobody Loves You More,\" were produced by both Albini and Deal \u2014 the ideal partnership of his experimentation and her musical skill.",
      "Deal\u2019s music has always been a reflection of both the rugged exterior needed to be a woman at the forefront of the '90s alternative rock scene as well as a tenderness that subverts the indifference often characterizing that same scene.",
      "Those features, ostensibly at odds with one another, culminate in \u201cNobody Loves You More,\u201d thanks to her poignant lyricism and the unique instrumentation woven throughout the record. At its heart, this is still a rock album \u2014 one that Deal is uniquely suited to make.",
      "The album\u2019s final track, \u201cA Good Time Pushed,\u201d musically and lyrically captures the fine line between doom and joy. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good time,\u201d she repeats, in what is perhaps an effort to convince herself that she is.",
      "Although the continuity is there between this album and the music of the Pixies and Deal's band The Breeders, aspects of it are unequivocally distinct.",
      "The resounding brass instruments on the title track and \u201cCoast,\u201d along with the orchestra featured on \u201cSummerland,\" are a departure from the traditional rock instrumentation that many listeners have come to associate with the 63-year-old.",
      "As the album title suggests, much of the songs on \u201cNobody Loves You More\u201d are also lyrically earnest and romantic. \u201cAre you mine?/Are you my baby?/I have no mind/For nothin but love,\u201d Deal croons on the doo-wop-inspired \u201cAre You Mine?\u201d",
      "There are anomalies \u2014 like in the drum- and synth-heavy \u201cBig Ben Beat,\u201d which is evocative of rocker Kim Gordon\u2019s electronic pivot in 2024's \u201cThe Collective.\" That one was produced only by Deal, not Albini.",
      "As a whole, \u201cNobody Loves You More\u201d is varied \u2014 and as distinctly American as the myriad locations which inspired it, from the Massachusetts island of Nantucket (the breezy sounds of \u201cCoast\u201d) to the Florida Keys (\"Summerland\") to Deal's hometown of Dayton, Ohio.",
      "Fans of the Pixies and the Breeders will find a lot to enjoy here \u2014 it is both familiar and different.",

Visitors get to pass through the office of Dolores Umbridge, the villainess character played by Imelda Staunton in the film series. They then board an omnidirectional lift, which simulates a chase to catch Umbridge, according to the theme park resort.",

      "Universal\u2019s main competition in the Orlando area, Walt Disney World, also has four theme parks, and it too plans to expand. Disney officials have indicated that they could invest up to $17 billion in the Florida resort and add a fifth theme park."

    "story": [
      "The August Wilson adaptation \u201cThe Piano Lesson\" is an impassioned family drama but it is also a profound ghost story",
      "The piano on the set of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d was not a mere prop. It could be played and the cast members often did. It was adorned with pictures of the Washington family and their ancestors. It was, John David Washington jokes, \u201cNo. 1 on the call sheet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe tried to haunt the piano itself, to charge it with that kind of spirit,\u201d says Malcolm Washington, the film\u2019s director and John David\u2019s brother.",
      "In \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d August Wilson\u2019s 1987 play, the piano is a central symbol of heritage, the past and survival. In 1930s Pittsburgh, it sits, unplayed, in the home of Berniece Charles ( Danielle Deadwyler ), having been passed down as a family heirloom from the days of slavery. But Berenice\u2019s visiting brother, Boy Willie ( John David Washington ), wants to sell it to buy the Mississippi land upon which their ancestors once toiled as slaves.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d which is currently playing in theaters and debuts Friday on Netflix, is an impassioned family drama but it is also a profound ghost story. For the Charles family, wrangling over the piano is a reckoning with their family\u2019s past, and the legacy of slavery. At its bone-rattling crescendo, it\u2019s an exorcism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exorcism and a possession,\u201d says Deadwyler. \u201cYou\u2019re releasing the thing that never worked and inviting in the thing that was always present but you might not have known.\u201d",
      "Adapting \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a play about ancestors and heritage, was fittingly a work of family. It\u2019s the third in a sterling string of Wilson adaptations produced by Denzel Washington, following \u201cFences\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom.\u201d But it\u2019s the first Washington mostly left to his family to make.",
      "\u201cCostanza, August\u2019s widow, came to me I don\u2019t know how many years ago and asked me to shepherd these plays. I said, \u2018I\u2019m the man for the job,\u2019\" Washington said an interview alongside producer Todd Black. \"So I\u2019ve been more of an administrator. I read the play a couple times to think about how can we get this made, is this a movie? In this case, a week or so into shooting, I was like, \u2018There\u2019s nothing for me to do. This kid knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s done his homework. I\u2019m just hanging around.\u2019\u201d",
      "If Denzel Washington has been moved to carry on the tradition of Wilson by a sense of legacy, it\u2019s something he passes down in \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d The film marks the directorial debut of Malcolm, 33, who also co-wrote the script with Virgil Williams.",
      "John David Washington, the \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d and \u201cTenet\u201d star, made his Wilson debut in a 2022 Broadway production of \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d playing Boy Willie. That production also featured Samuel L. Jackson, who originated the role of Boy Willie in 1987 at the Yale Repertory Theatre, playing Berniece and Boy Willie's uncle, Doaker Charles, a role he carries over in the film.",
      "\u201cYou have all these great artists playing these notes \u2013 you have the OGs, the Wilsonians, playing it,\u201d says John David. \u201cThen you have the newcomers playing it. You start jamming together and you find it together.\u201d",
      "In Wilson, there's no greater musicality than the language, the blues poetry of Wilson's slang-drenched rhythms. The brash, fast-talking Boy Willie, in particular, is a verbal force \u2014 one that John David was enthralled by.",
      "\u201cIt feels freaking so good when the truth is coming out and you know the truth is coming out and you\u2019re discovering new meanings in these monologues that you go over and over in your head,\u201d says John David. \u201cWhen it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a beautiful feeling. I live for those moments.\u201d",
      "For the actors, finding the music of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d meant channeling generations worth of pain and perseverance in Black American life. Much of it they understood instinctually. Some of it they found together.",
      "\u201cBerniece has a massive amount of weight and put on top of that is grief and loss and longing,\u201d says Deadwyler, the \u201cTill\u201d star. \u201cThose are things that have been with me and in women I\u2019ve witnessed all my life. You think about the lives these women have lived and you carry it and you bear it.\u201d",
      "The cast and filmmakers were also mindful of a legacy of performance they were working in. When Harry Belafonte died during the shoot, Malcolm played a song of his on set. The day before \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d played at the Toronto International Film Festival, James Earl Jones, who starred in the original production of \u201cFences,\u201d died.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up watching movies. And I didn\u2019t get in the business for movies. I wanted to be James Earl Jones,\u201d says Denzel. \u201cI was thinking of theater. To be honest with you, when I started, there weren\u2019t a whole lot of Black people for me to be like. We weren\u2019t the leading men.\u201d",
      "For Denzel, August Wilson became a lifeblood.",
      "\u201cThese are the best roles around,\" he says. \"Everybody wants \u2018em. I want \u2019em.\u201d",
      "In the film's dramatic third act, when the supernatural enters, Deadwyler could feel presences in the room. This is when \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d quakes open with all of the pain and tragedy it has been building toward. The walls \u2014 hung with photos of the actors' own relatives \u2014 shake. Deadwyler, Malcolm says, was gone. She was somewhere else.",
      "\u201cI do recall when the ancestors were coming into the room,\u201d Deadwyler says. \u201cMy eyes are closed a lot, but people carry energy. And I knew when they came in. The breath shifts.\u201d"

      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers, writes AP reviewer Rob Merrill about Myers\u2019 memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow.\u201d",
      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers. From a decade doing everything for ESPN (SportsCenter, play by play, and succeeding Roy Firestone as host of the interview show \u201cUp Close\u201d) to decades of involvement with nearly every league under contract with Fox Sports (NFL, NASCAR, Major League Baseball), the kid from Miami has truly seen and done it all when it comes to sports television.",
      "Which is why it\u2019s a little surprising that his memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow,\u201d isn\u2019t more revealing. It hits all the admittedly very high points \u2014 the first live interview with O.J. Simpson following the civil judgement against him in the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders, the 1989 California earthquake that postponed the World Series for a week, and live on-the-scene reporting from the Centennial Park bombing at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 \u2014 but a lot of it is pulled from transcripts and comes across as a rather dry retelling of what fans will recall seeing on TV.",
      "For readers looking to get into the business, though, there\u2019s some good advice in these pages. Myers knew early on what he wanted to do with his life and began writing down his goals. \u201cGet on the radio. Be an anchor on TV,\u201d he scrawled in lipstick on his mirror as a kid. As he grew, he swapped the mirror for note cards and kept them close to his bed, reading them often as reminders. And as he climbed to a top rung on the TV sports ladder, he followed this adage: \u201cIf you don\u2019t jump at unexpected opportunities, you won\u2019t get more than what\u2019s expected.\u201d That\u2019s the tenet that convinced him to leave ESPN for Fox Sports, which was essentially a network start-up in 1998.",
      "That decision led to a slew of opportunities that brought Myers face-to-face with a galaxy of sports stars. He recalls some of his most memorable on-camera moments, from Tom Brady after winning Super Bowls to Mike Tyson in his heyday to the Boise State player who proposed to his cheerleader girlfriend live on Fox. Unlike many TV sportscasters, Myers never got pigeonholed into a sport, which explains how he became the voice of NASCAR as stock car racing surged in popularity.",
      "Being on TV does have its perks, and Myers\u2019 personal friendships with Bill Murray and Charles Barkley fall into that category. Some of the best chapters recount escapades with each of them, one involving a corned beef sandwich and another Barkley\u2019s prodigious gambling habit. There\u2019s also some real heart here, as most fans will probably have forgotten the personal loss Myers experienced in 2012 when his 19-year-old son Christopher died in a car accident.",
      "\u201cBack then I thought, \u2018Well, there\u2019ll be other days.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize that that was the only day,\u201d is a line spoken by actor Burt Lancaster as Archie \u201cMoonlight\u201d Graham in the movie \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and Myers uses it to reflect on how it felt (and still feels) to lose a son. The supportive role played by Rick Hendrick, the legendary owner of Hendrick Motorsports, during that tumultuous time in Myers\u2019 life, is a touching revelation.",
      "In the end, it\u2019s easy to forgive Myers for not dishing more or burning any bridges in his memoir. He admits he\u2019s lived his dream and perhaps the ultimate lesson readers should take from the book is that, sometimes, nice guys do finish first.",

During his tenure, Lawton created a program to help victims navigate the confusing and potentially traumatizing course of criminal court proceedings. It became a model adopted by other prosecutors across Georgia.",
      "\u201cHe was a huge proponent for victims of crimes,\" said Meg Heap, an assistant prosecutor under Lawton who later served as Chatham County's district attorney from 2013 through 2020. \u201cYou stand on the side of right and you bring justice for somebody who would not otherwise get it, a victim coming in who\u2019s dirt poor and thinks nobody cares. That was Spencer.\u201d",
      "Despite his nearly three decades as the Savannah area's top state prosecutor, Lawton would become best known for a murder case that began just a few months after he took office.",
      "In May 1981, antiques dealer Jim Williams called police to his 19th century mansion in Savannah's historic district. Williams had fatally shot 21-year-old Danny Hansford, an employee and Williams' lover. Though Williams insisted he killed Hansford in self-defense, police suspected he staged the scene to make it appear that Hansford had fired a gun at him first.",
      "Lawton had Williams indicted on a murder charge and personally prosecuted the case. It went to trial four times, with the Georgia Supreme Court overturning convictions in the first two trials and the third ending with a hung jury. Williams was ultimately acquitted in 1989. He died at home seven months later.",
      "The case's twists and turns formed the central narrative of John Berendt's 1994 bestseller \u201cMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\u201d With Williams as its central character, the book portrayed Lawton as his \u201celoquent and venomous\u201d courtroom antagonist.",
      "When Clint Eastwood directed a 1997 movie based on the book, the district attorney was renamed Finley Largent.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about the Williams case when I think of Spencer\u2019s contributions to the community,\u201d said David Lock, who served as Lawton's chief assistant prosecutor. \u201cI never read the book. But from what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s an unfair portrayal of Spencer Lawton.\u201d",
      "Lawton created a special program for assisting crime victims as well as courtroom witnesses soon after he first took office. He hired and trained advocates to explain to victims how the legal process works, give them updates on scheduled court hearings and sometimes to help them find counseling.",
      "Other district attorneys across Georgia began expanding and improving their own victim-witness programs based on what Lawton was doing in Savannah, said Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Georgia Prosecuting Attorneys Council.",
      "\u201cPrior to the victim-witness assistance programs really getting started, victims came into a criminal justice system not of their own free will and were basically not kept apprised of developments in their cases,\" Skandalakis said. \u201cThe prosecutors themselves were far too busy keeping up with their daily caseload. So there wasn\u2019t someone in a DA's office that a victim could just reach out and talk to.\u201d",
      "Lawton retired as district attorney at the end of 2008. Two years later, he helped lead an effort to expand crime victims' rights under state law.",
      "The 2010 law guaranteed victims an opportunity to speak in court during sentencing hearings for offenders. It also required that victims be notified of the resolution of cases involving crimes against them, as well as anytime the perpetrators escaped or were released from prison.",
      "\u201cHe brought professionalism to any endeavor he undertook,\u201d Lock said. \u201cAnd his special contribution to district attorneys' offices and the legal profession as a whole was his championing of victims\u2019 rights.\u201d"

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. He said his father died at a Tokyo hospital due to old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a bestseller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad,\" a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children, and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "In his prose poem with that title, in which a boy is opening a Coke can, he wrote: \u201cIf, for instance, he saw the infinite universe that started or ended at the tip of his can, he was totally unaware of it. One might be able to opine that he named every bit of the unknown about to swallow him with all the vocabulary he could muster, which included his future vocabulary that was yet dormant in his subconscious.\u201d",
      "In his debut poem that catapulted him to stardom, he is more sparse:",
      "\u201cBecause the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,\u201d is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.",
      "When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Travel writer Arthur Frommer, who revolutionized leisure travel for ordinary Americans with his guidebook \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by convincing average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\u201cMy father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\u201d",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry\u2019s best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer\u2019s brand, led today by his daughter Pauline, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many times where you have young men and women who have a lot of talent and potential. They can be robbed of that potential when they start to really struggle with their addictions,\u201d Walsh told Gaulden. \u201cI don\u2019t want that for you.\u201d",
      "Walsh continued saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure that in your future, once you\u2019re done with your federal prison time, you can be really successful on federal probation and have a really bright future where you can reach your full potential in every aspect of your life. Best of luck to you, Mr. Gaulden.\u201d",
      "Gaulden, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, also is known as YoungBoy Never Broke Again and has achieved four No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 and one Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. His music includes \u201c38 Baby,\u201d \u201cOutside Today\u201d and Tyler, The Creator\u2019s song, \u201cWusyaname,\u201d on which he is featured with Ty Dolla $ign. That collaboration earned them a Grammy nomination in 2022 for Best Melodic Rap Performance.",
      "Billboard reported only pop star Taylor Swift and rapper Drake had more streams in 2022, despite Gaulden having nearly zero radio airplay. According to Spotify, Gaulden has over 16 million monthly listeners."

    "title": "Singer Paul Kelly: An Australian icon the country seems to be keeping for its own",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 12:58:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Singer-songwriter Paul Kelly is an icon in Australia but a cult figure in the rest of the world",
    "story": [
      "Singer-songwriter Paul Kelly is an icon in Australia but a cult figure in the rest of the world",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first visit to New York in seven years, Paul Kelly made sure to stop at Katz's deli, check out a friend's restaurant recommendation in Little Italy, and take some long walks. Then there was business to attend to, when he stepped onstage at a Bleecker Street club to sing his songs.",
      "To followers back home in Australia, where a Kelly show at the Sydney Opera House sells out, that's something like a New Jersey tourist finding Bruce Springsteen strumming his guitar in the corner of a Melbourne bar.",
      "While the world is more connected today than ever, it is still a big place, and regional differences abound in cuisine, culture and other traditions. The 69-year-old Kelly illustrates the phenomenon. He's iconic and growing in popularity in Australia, while a cult figure \u2014 at best \u2014 elsewhere.",
      "\u201cHe's like our Bruce Springsteen,\u201d said Vicki Zubovic, an expatriate who came to Kelly's mid-October show at New York's Le Poisson Rouge nightclub. \u201cHe tells our stories, about love, loss and all of life.\u201d",
      "Other Australians in the audience sing along to references from home in his music \u2014 like the MCG, or Melbourne Cricket Grounds.",
      "Kelly also paid debts, and showed his admiration for, the United States. He started the show with \u201cCareless,\u201d one of his best-known songs, with the opening line of \u201chow many cabs in New York City?\u201d He included \u201cEverything's Turning to White,\u201d his composition based on the Raymond Carver short story \u201cSo Much Water So Close to Home.\u201d The story of a new love, \u201cGonna Be Good,\u201d references Johnny Cash's \u201cI Walk the Line.\u201d \u201cThe line is narrow,\u201d Kelly sang. \u201cThe line is long.\u201d",
      "He's a plain-spoken songwriter whose best work is rich in emotional resonance. That's what struck one of America's best songwriters, Lucinda Williams, when her husband Tom Overby took her to see Kelly in a Los Angeles club several years ago. Williams had heard his name while touring in Australia, but never his music.",
      "\u201cI was completely blown away,\u201d she recalled in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI remember turning to Tom with a look of awe mixed with admiration and saying, \u2018God, this guy is really good.\u2019\u201d",
      "So why the relative anonymity on this side of the world? Kelly's best chance may have come in the early 1990s when signed to a major label, A&M Records, after he emerged playing with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll bands like the Dots and Messengers in the 1980s, but without a quick stateside success he was dropped. \u201cPart of it might be the record industry,\u201d said Williams, who has her own horror stories. \u201cLet's just blame it on them.\u201d",
      "His restless eclecticism probably harms him. He\u2019s recorded bluegrass music, an album of Shakespearian sonnets, a blues collaboration of songs performed at funerals and a musical interpretation of poems inspired by birds. Tough sells for a music marketer, in other words.",
      "Then mix in some bad luck and simple geography. For his first time in the U.S. this fall since the pandemic, Kelly was to open a tour headlined by Shawn Colvin and Keb' Mo', but it was canceled due to the bluesman's heart surgery. Over the years, he's lost money on U.S. tours. The temptation to stay home and play in arenas is obvious.",
      "He comes over to the United States as much as he can, but how people respond is out of his hands, Kelly said over lunch the day after his New York show.",
      "\u201cThat's life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's show business.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I started writing songs and performing music, I never thought of it as a career,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I hate the word \u2018career.\u2019 For me, I\u2019m hoping to have a job where my work is my play. I manage to make a living out of it, so everything else is a bonus.\u201d",
      "A new album this fall shows Kelly's storytelling ability. Images of the \u201cthermos of sweet tea steaming,\u201d cockatoos calling and fishing lines in the back of the car on \u201cGoing to the River with Dad\u201d make a listener accompany Kelly on a trip with his real-life father, who died when his son was 13. In \u201cAll Those Smiling Faces,\u201d he brings photo albums to life as he sings, \u201cget on the floor and dance! You don't have forever.\u201d",
      "Kelly cites the work of songwriters like Ray Davies, Lou Reed and Chuck Berry as inspirations. \u201cYou can see their songs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re cinematic. That\u2019s why I sort of lean that way.\u201d",
      "Family is a big part of his work. On \u201cWhen I First Met Your Ma,\u201d Kelly is a man who tells his children about their parent's courtship. \u201cLove like a bird flies away,\u201d he sings. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out the only way.\u201d",
      "The narrator in \u201cTo Her Door\u201d \u2014 listed by the Australasian Performing Rights Association as one of the 30 best Australian songs of all time \u2014 tells of a man thrown out of his house for drinking as he travels back in a cab months later seeking reconciliation. You feel his nerves. Will it work? The listener never learns.",
      "\u201cI write mostly love songs, like most songwriters do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I realized early on that most of my songs were not just about two people. When you start writing about people in a relationship, there are a lot of other people involved. There are exes, their parents, maybe children and siblings and friends.\u201d",
      "His catalogue is so vast and varied that in the late 2000s he hit upon the idea of performing 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over the course of four nights. The resulting tour produced a box set and eventually a book.",
      "Kelly's \u201cHow to Make Gravy\u201d is his tour de force. Asked in 1996 to record a song for a holiday compilation, his first choice of the Band's \u201cChristmas Must Be Tonight\u201d was already taken. So he tried writing his own.",
      "The result is a song with no chorus and set in prison \u2014 no jingle bells here \u2014 where the narrator phones his brother to pass along a recipe for the family feast. The call is about a lot more, of course, as he expresses regret, longing, fear of his surroundings, paranoia, even some humor. An early hint that he'd made a connection came when Kelly's brother called to say he had to pull to the side of the road when he first heard it. He was weeping.",
      "Now December 21 \u2014 the date of the phone call mentioned in the song's lyric \u2014 is known as \u201cGravy Day\u201d in Australia. Bella O'Grady, a 27-year-old woman who moved to New York earlier this year and attended Kelly's Le Poisson Rouge show, said \u201cGravy\u201d always evokes warm feelings of holiday celebrations.",
      "Kelly \u201chas become part of the Australian psyche, part of the Australian way of looking at the world \u2014 a bit cheeky, a bit cocky,\u201d said Glenn A. Baker, a music historian and former editor of Billboard in Australia.",
      "\u201cHis songs are so much a part of us,\" Baker said. \"We can't work out why they're not part of you. For many Australians, we don't mind that at all. It means he's all ours and we don't have to share him with the world.\u201d"

      "Father John Misty\u2019s sixth studio album is titled \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d a reference to cremation",
      "The title of Father John Misty's sixth studio album, \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d is a reference to cremation, and the first song proposes \u201ca corpse dance.\u201d Religious overtones mix with the undercurrent of a midlife crisis atop his folk chamber pop. And for those despairing recent events, some lyrics seem topical.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always the darkest right before the end,\u201d Misty sings on \u201cScreamland,\u201d a power ballad full of desperation and overdriven amplifiers. His advice: \u201cStay young, get numb, keep dreaming.\u201d",
      "\u201cScreamland\u201d is one of eight songs on \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d Misty\u2019s jaundiced, smart, cynical, droll, druggy, opaque, arch, theatrical take on life \u2013 and death. The album will be released Friday, Nov. 22.",
      "Misty, the stage name for Josh Tillman, describes himself in one song as a windbag. While that\u2019s a bit harsh, the album will delight those who enjoy listening to music with a dictionary.",
      "\u201cShaken like a pawl fly/obscene as a lick,\u201d Misty sings on the title cut. \u201cPanoply,\u201d \u201cpanopticon\u201d and \u201cthe Anthropocene\u201d also receive mentions.",
      "Misty can be verbose or concise: Three song titles are complete sentences. Incongruous but colorful couplets come in waves, seeking answers while unsure of the question.",
      "Misty frames his wordsmithery in cinematic rock noir arrangements as dense as the lyrics. A marvelous string section underpins the lush sound, darting and swooping amid thundering drums and a pounding piano.",
      "Tempos tend toward slow, matching Misty\u2019s melodrama. But \u201cShe Cleans Up\u201d is delightfully jagged art rock, with slashing guitars and sax, and \u201cI Guess Time Just Makes Fools of Us All\u201d pairs a sweet groove and sour outlook. Characters come and go on the latter tune, but through nine verses the song repeatedly reaches the same rueful conclusion.",
      "The title cut runs even longer, needing nearly 10 minutes for descriptions, such as courtiers \u201cresplendent in donor class panache.\u201d It\u2019s a love story.",
      "So is \u201cMental Health,\u201d a whimsical ode to insanity with Disney-esque woodwinds and backing vocals. \u201cNo one knows you like yourself,\u201d goes one lyric. \u201cYou two should speak in the presence of a licensee.\u201d",
      "On \u201cMahashmashana,\u201d Misty wrestles with a reality that is confounding, off-kilter, even crazy, knowing it won\u2019t end well. Root for him.",

      "Husain, who was born in Pakistan and later lived in Tanzania, Thailand and the Philippines, said her international background was in keeping with Borlaug's work and the foundation's efforts to expand its efforts in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world. She has worked at the foundation for 16 years.",
      "\u201cI grew up all over the world and many of these places are places where Normal Borlaug spent a lot of his time, so I feel a deep connection to him,\u201d Husain said in an interview. \u201cHaving lived all over the world, I've witnessed poverty and hunger. I've been surrounded by it since I was a little girl.\u201d",

      "New measures also include more intensive testing of Warsaw's sewage, renewing the vaccination stocks and updating the list of children still unvaccinated. Polio is most often spread by contact with waste from an infected person or, less frequently, through contaminated water or food.",

      "A South Dakota judge dismissed a lawsuit that an anti-abortion group filed in June targeting an abortion rights measure that voters rejected this month.",
      "In an order dated Friday, Circuit Court Judge John Pekas granted Life Defense Fund's motion to dismiss its lawsuit against Dakotans for Health, the measure group.",
      "In a statement, Life Defense Fund co-chair Leslee Unruh said: \u201cThe people have decided, and South Dakotans overwhelmingly rejected this constitutional abortion measure. We have won in the court of public opinion, and South Dakotans clearly saw the abortion lobby\u2019s deception.\u201d",
      "Dakotans for Health co-founder Rick Weiland said he had expected the lawsuit to be dismissed.",
      "\u201cThe Life Defense Fund\u2019s accusations were part of a broader, failed effort to keep Amendment G off the ballot and silence the voices of South Dakota voters,\u201d Weiland said in a statement. \"But make no mistake \u2014 this dismissal is just one battle in a much larger war over the future of direct democracy in South Dakota.\u201d",
      "Life Defense Fund's lawsuit had challenged petitions that got the measure on the ballot, saying they contained invalid signatures and circulators committed fraud and various wrongdoing. The anti-abortion group sought to invalidate the ballot initiative and bar the measure group and its workers from doing ballot-measure work for four years.",

      "A judge has struck down Wyoming\u2019s overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy in line with voters in yet more states voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state\u2019s first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \u201cwill undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\u201d Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn\u2019t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won\u2019t be necessary with this ruling."

      "Doctors, nurses and an ambulance driver are among health care workers on trial accused of causing at least 10 infant deaths linked to a scheme to defraud Turkey's social security system",
      "ISTANBUL -- Doctors, nurses and an ambulance driver are among 47 people on trial accused of causing the deaths of 10 infants as part of an alleged scheme to defraud Turkey\u2019s social security system.",
      "The defendants are accused of transferring babies to neonatal units of 19 private hospitals where the infants were allegedly kept for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments. At least 10 newborns are alleged to have died in the past year due to neglect or malpractice in facilities that were unprepared to treat them.",
      "Prosecutors at the trial, which opened in Istanbul on Monday, say the defendants also falsified reports to make the babies\u2019 condition appear more serious with the aim obtaining payments from the social security institution.",
      "The main defendants have denied any wrongdoing, insisting they made the best possible decisions and face punishment for unavoidable unwanted outcomes.",
      "The case, which emerged last month, has sparked public outrage and calls for a greater oversight of the health care system. Authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed nine of the 19 hospitals that were implicated in the scandal.",
      "Dr. Firat Sari, the main defendant who operated the neonatal intensive care units of several private hospitals in Istanbul, is facing a sentence of up to 583 years in prison.",
      "He is charged with establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime, defrauding public institutions, forgery of official documents, and homicide by negligence.",
      "During questioning by prosecutors, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment.",
      "He told prosecutors: \u201cEverything is in accordance with procedures.\u201d",
      "Dozens of demonstrators joined protests outside the courthouse, chanting: \u201cBaby killers will be held accountable\u201d and \u201c\u2018Private hospitals should be shut down.\u201d",
      "Over 350 families have petitioned prosecutors or other state institutions seeking investigations into the deaths of their loved ones, according to state media.",
      "Among them is Hacire Akinci, 42, who lost her baby last year after eight years of fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cThey gave us a medical report that said the baby had died of natural causes. But apparently that wasn't the case,\u201d she told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cI want charges to be brought, I want justice to be served.\u201d",
      "The case has led to calls for the resignation of Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu, who was the Istanbul provincial health director at the time some of the deaths occurred. Ozgur Ozel, the main opposition party leader, has called for all hospitals involved to be seized by the state and nationalized.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said those responsible for the deaths would be severely punished but warned against placing all the blame on the country\u2019s health care system.",

      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring Thanksgiving tradition for many experienced runners and novices alike",
      "Thanksgiving morning is often a blur of last-minute meal preparation and frenzied chores. But for Beth Thomas, who typically hosts her family at her Boston-area home, most of the work in the kitchen is already done.",
      "Instead, she laces up her sneakers and warms up for a 5K Turkey Trot run with her two sons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing for us to do, knowing probably seven hours later, everyone\u2019s going to be passed out on the couch after having overindulged appropriately. It\u2019s a high point for us to be out there,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cWhy not start the day doing something that we really love and then eat a lot of good food later?\u201d",
      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring tradition for many people on and around Thanksgiving. There are thousands of races, ranging from about 1 mile to a full marathon.",
      "Run Signup, a platform where runners can register and fundraise for races, calls Thanksgiving \u201cthe biggest US running day of the year.\u201d More and more people are joining in, it said; 2023 saw the highest number of turkey trotters ever registered on the site, with almost 1 million runners across the country.",
      "Some do it for fitness, others for family and community, and many are also raising money for charities. The races attract both novices and serious runners.",
      "There are also Turkey Trots that go by other names: Gobble Wobbles, Drumstick Dashes and Huffing for Stuffings. While most races are held on Thanksgiving Day, some take place the weekend before or after.",
      "Thomas and her sons have run in Thanksgiving races for several years. Sometimes other relatives join them. Still others cheer them on from the sidelines.",
      "Thanksgiving exercise events are by no means a novel idea. Just ask the 14,000 participants in the upcoming Turkey Trot in Buffalo, New York, which will be the local YMCA\u2019s 129th annual race.",
      "Mike Baggerman, the communications director at the YMCA Buffalo Niagara, said Buffalo\u2019s race \u2014 officially a year older than the Boston Marathon \u2014 has become a hallmark for the community.",
      "While some runners show up for the 8K race with a competitive spirit and achieve record-setting times, the overwhelming majority are \u201cpeople like you and me who just want to have something fun to do on Thanksgiving Day.\u201d",
      "Children and people who use wheelchairs are frequent participants, Baggerman said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most memorable races,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun run.\u201d",
      "Many beginning runners train in the weeks and months leading up to Thanksgiving to compete in a Turkey Trot. Even for those who don\u2019t run regularly, the jolt of activity \u2014 perhaps a mix of walking and running \u2014 can feel good.",
      "Prioritizing exercise and movement during a week when many have long to-do lists and multiple stressors is often difficult, said dietician and Michigan-based fitness instructor Casey Young. To her, Thanksgiving races can not only help people reach their physical activity goals but also help stabilize their mood and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cHolidays tend to be such a stressful time for a lot of people, and sometimes people are traveling, and that can add some additional stress and get you out of your typical routine,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo, anytime we have an opportunity to move our body is a positive thing.\u201d",
      "Exercise may prompt people to be \u201cmore mindful and intentional\u201d when plating up later, Young said, but she warns against the mentality that the purpose of the exertion is to earn a decadent Thanksgiving meal or to burn it off afterward. That could foster an \u201cunhealthy relationship with food.\u201d",
      "Turkey trotters should instead emphasize the physical activity and its health benefits, she said.",
      "Beyond the physical and mental benefits, many turkey trotters lean into the holiday\u2019s spirit of thankfulness and giving back.",
      "Some of the races are organized as fundraisers in partnership with local organizations. Registration fees for participants and donations on their behalf often benefit causes like food banks, homeless shelters and community programs.",
      "Baggerman said the Buffalo Niagara YMCA\u2019s turkey trot is the organization\u2019s largest fundraiser of the year, raising money for affordable childcare, community classes, health and wellness programs, and efforts to combat food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a fun 5-mile run on Thanksgiving Day. It\u2019s something that helps the YMCA achieve its mission, which is to strengthen the western New York community,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Buffalo people to step up every single year and sell this race out at 14,000, it\u2019s a miracle.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",

      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.",

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "\u201cIt's outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d said the statement from U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all Democrats.",
      "They called on the Navy to take \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for its failures and immediately implement the inspector general's recommendations.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said in a statement that the inspector general's findings align with previous evaluations and support corrective actions the Navy is implementing.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to constant improvement to ensure the highest standards of operation, maintenance, safety, and oversight at all of our facilities at all times,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Navy last year issued written reprimands to three retired military officers for their roles in the fuel spill in a move the Sierra Club called \u201cslaps on the wrist.\u201d",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he welcomed the inspector general's findings, which he said underscored what environmental advocates had long alleged.",
      "\"We will continue to insist on transparency and accountability surrounding the issue of Red Hill, as all people who live in Hawai\u02bbi deserve pure, clean drinking water,\u201d Green said in a statement."

      "Lahore and Multan, the province\u2019s two main cities hit by smog, remained the two most polluted cities in the world on Wednesday, with air quality index readings of about 400, according to the Environmental Protection Department. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",

      "Kim Jong Un has renewed his call for a \u201climitless\u201d expansion.",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un renewed his call for a \u201climitless\u201d expansion of his military nuclear program to counter U.S.-led threats in comments reported Monday that were his first direct criticism toward Washington since Donald Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election.",
      "At a conference with army officials on Friday, Kim condemned the United States for updating its nuclear deterrence strategies with South Korea and solidifying three-way military cooperation involving Japan, which he portrayed as an \u201cAsian NATO\u201d that was escalating tensions and instability in the region.",
      "Kim also criticized the United States over its support of Ukraine against a prolonged Russian invasion. He insisted that Washington and its Western allies were using Ukraine as their \u201cshock troops\u201d to wage a war against Moscow and expand the scope of U.S. military influence, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said.",
      "Kim has prioritized his country\u2019s ties to Russia in recent months, embracing the idea of a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d and displaying a united front in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s broader conflicts with the West.",
      "He has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the development of his nuclear-armed military, which now has various nuclear-capable systems targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim has yet to directly acknowledge that he has been providing military equipment and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine and the KCNA\u2019s report didn\u2019t mention whether Kim made any comments toward Trump, whose election win has yet to be reported in the North\u2019s state media.",
      "Kim met Trump three times in 2018 and 2019 in Trump\u2019s first presidency, but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements in exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions and North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program. North Korea has since suspended any meaningful talks with Washington and Seoul as Kim ramped up his testing activity and military demonstrations in the face of what he portrayed as \u201cgangster-like U.S. threats.\u201d There\u2019s concern in Seoul that Kim in exchange for his military support of Russia would receive Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal.",
      "Trump\u2019s election win has touched off speculation about a resumption of a summit-driven diplomacy with Kim, which was described by critics as a \u201cbromance.\u201d But some experts say a quick return to 2018 is highly unlikely, as too much has changed about the regional security situation and broader geopolitics since then.",
      "While the North Korean nuclear problem was relatively an independent issue during Trump\u2019s first term, it is now connected with broader challenges created by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and further complicated by weakened sanctions enforcement against Pyongyang, Hwang Ildo, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy, wrote in a study last week.",
      "North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program is now much more advanced, which would increase Kim\u2019s perception of his bargaining powers. Kim\u2019s efforts to boost North Korea\u2019s presence in a united front against Washington could also gain strength if Trump spikes tariffs and rekindles a trade war with China, the North\u2019s main ally and economic lifeline, Hwang said.",
      "Amid the stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington, Kim has been dialing up pressure on South Korea, abandoning his country\u2019s long-standing goal of inter-Korean reconciliation and verbally threatening to attack the South with nukes if provoked.",
      "Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South\u2019s biggest airport.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea again flew trash-laden balloons toward the South early Monday and issued a statement warning the North \u201cnot to test our military\u2019s patience any further.\u201d The North has launched about 7,000 balloons toward the South since May, causing property damage but so far no injuries. On at least two occasions, trash carried by North Korea\u2019s balloons fell on Seoul\u2019s presidential compound, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key sites.",

      "A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Monday told investigators they have one month to complete their work on ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close aides",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Monday told investigators they have one month to complete their work on ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close aides, who face charges of crimes against humanity after hundreds of people were killed in a mass uprising this summer.",
      "Golam Mortuza Majumdar, the head judge of the three-member International Crimes Tribunal, set Dec. 17 for investigators to finish their work, as the tribunal heard updates Monday from police about what the country's security agencies have done to arrest Hasina and her close aides.",
      "The decision came after prosecutors sought more time for the investigation.",
      "Mohammed Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of the tribunal, told the judges during Monday's hearing that they were working in line with an extradition treaty signed earlier with India to make Hasina's return possible.",
      "Hasina has been living in exile in India since Aug. 5 when she fled the country amid the student-led protests. The Dhaka-based tribunal on Oct. 17 issued arrest warrants for Hasina and 45 others, including former Cabinet ministers, advisers and military and civil officials. The country is now being run by an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.",
      "At least 13 people, including a former law minister and a businessman who was Hasina\u2019s private-sector adviser, appeared before the tribunal on Monday, said B.M. Sultan Mahmud, a prosecutor at the tribunal. One former Cabinet minister was not brought to the tribunal as he was in custody for police interrogation in a separate case. A further six people will appear on Wednesday, tribunal officials said. At least 20 suspects have been arrested in the case.",
      "The tribunal will also seek updates from police on their progress in arresting the other suspects, including Hasina.",
      "After the hearing on Monday, the tribunal\u2019s head judge ordered authorities to send all 13 suspects to jail, pending investigation.",
      "The chief prosecutor of the tribunal has already sought help from Interpol through the country\u2019s police chief to arrest Hasina. On Sunday, Yunus said in an address to the nation that his administration would seek Hasina's extradition from India.",
      "Authorities say hundreds of people were killed during the uprising in July and August, mainly by security agents seeking to quell the initial protests over government jobs. The violence intensified as the protests morphed into an anti-government movement, with more bloodshed, ending Hasina\u2019s 15-year rule. Hasina had also earlier sought an investigation into the killings."

      "CHIBA, Japan -- An Australian accused of smuggling amphetamines in a suitcase appeared in a Japanese court on Monday nearly two years after her arrest, saying she is innocent and that she was tricked into carrying them as part of an online romance scam.",
      "Donna Nelson from Perth, Australia, was arrested at Japan\u2019s Narita International Airport just outside Tokyo when customs officials found about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of stimulants, or phenylaminopropane, hidden in a double-bottom suitcase she was carrying.",
      "Nelson, 58, said she received the suitcase from an acquaintance of a man she met on social media in 2020, and brought it from Laos to Tokyo as instructed. She was supposed to meet up with the man in Japan but he never showed up, according to prosecutors.",
      "She was arrested on the spot and later charged with violating the stimulants control and customs laws. She has been in custody for nearly two years.",
      "Monday\u2019s trial comes just weeks after the recent acquittal of an 88-year-old former boxer, Iwao Hakamada, who was on death row for about half a century on wrongful murder convictions. That case rekindled concerns about Japan\u2019s largely closed-door investigation processes and lengthy trials.",
      "Nelson, in a brief statement at the Chiba District Court near Tokyo, said she did not know the drugs were hidden in the suitcase and that she was carrying them for a man she thought she loved. The man told her he was the Nigerian owner of a fashion business and paid for her trip to Japan via Laos, her lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors acknowledged the case is linked to a romance scam but accused Nelson of smuggling the drugs, claiming she knew the contents of the suitcase.",
      "A verdict is expected on Dec. 4.",
      "Nelson entered the courtroom escorted by a pair of uniformed guards who removed her handcuffs and a rope around her waist as she took a seat to stand trial. She repeatedly looked toward her daughters who were seated in the audience.",
      "It was an emotional moment for her and her family to see each other for the first time since her arrest.",
      "One of Nelson\u2019s daughters, Kristal Hilaire, said she wants the court to know her mother is a good person.",
      "\u201cShe thought she was coming to Japan for her love story. She didn\u2019t have any other intentions other than that. And that\u2019s what we need everyone to know and hear at the court this week,\u201d Hilaire said.",
      "The daughter added that the family is \u201cjust trying to be strong because when mom locks her eyes with us, I want her to feel our strength and that she will feed off that.\u201d",
      "Nelson\u2019s lawyer Rie Nishida said that customs officials' limited English-language ability might have led to mistranslations and the accusation that Nelson knew what she was carrying.",
      "In Monday's trial, a customs official testified that his colleague was mainly asking questions to Nelson in English but ended up calling an interpreter and what she had said earlier was only summed up in Japanese during an interview that was not recorded.",
      "Nishida asked the judges and a jury panel of citizens to carefully listen to Nelson, who she said was finally given a capable court interpreter, to make a fair judgement.",

      "The state Main Sanitary Inspectorate in a statement said the presence of the virus does not necessarily mean people have been sick, but those who have not been vaccinated against polio could be at risk. The vaccinations are free in Poland for people under 19.",
      "New measures also include more intensive testing of Warsaw's sewage, renewing the vaccination stocks and updating the list of children still unvaccinated. Polio is most often spread by contact with waste from an infected person or, less frequently, through contaminated water or food.",
      "The polio virus mostly affects children under 5. Most people infected don\u2019t have symptoms, but in severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that 1 in 200 polio cases results in permanent paralysis, usually of the legs.",
      "Poland's inspectorate said about 86% of the country's 3-year-olds have been vaccinated against polio and that vaccinating at least 95% of children can prevent the spread of the virus. Poland has seen the rise of anti-vaccination movements among some parents, which has worried health officials.",

      "The Oct. 26 election kept the governing Georgian Dream party in power, but opponents say the vote was rigged with Russia's assistance. Many Georgians viewed the election as a referendum on the country\u2019s effort to join the European Union. Several large protests have been held since then.",
      "President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, declared on Monday that she would appeal the vote results to the Constitutional Court.

      "Experts had doubted Brazil 's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva could convince assembled leaders to hammer out agreement given uncertainty about the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and heightened global tensions amid the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Further dimming prospects of consensus, Argentina\u2019s negotiators challenged some of the draft language \u2014 and ultimately refrained from endorsing the complete document.",
      "\u201cAlthough generic, it is a positive surprise for Brazil,\u201d said Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister. \u201cThere was a moment when there was risk of no declaration at all. Despite the caveats, it is a good result for Lula.\u201d",

      "Such lack of specificity is true of the entire declaration, Velasco added. \u201cIt is very much in line with what Brazil hoped for ... but if we really analyze it carefully, it is very much a declaration of intent.

The official from the G20 nation with knowledge of the negotiations said Argentina adopted the statement under intense pressure from world powers.

      "Lula has been calling for reform of the powerful Security Council since his first two terms in power, from 2003-2010, but had gained little traction. Charged with maintaining international peace and security, it has not changed from its original 1945 configuration.

      "The Kremlin warns that Washington's decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles would stoke the war and escalate international tensions",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The Kremlin warned Monday that President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to let Ukraine strike targets inside Russia with U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles adds \u201cfuel to the fire\u201d of the war and would escalate international tensions even higher.",
      "Biden\u2019s shift in policy added an uncertain, new factor to the conflict on the eve of the 1,000-day milestone since Russia began its full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "It also came as a Russian ballistic missile with cluster munitions struck a residential area of Sumy in northern Ukraine, killing 11 people and injuring 84 others. Another missile barrage sparked apartment fires in the southern port of Odesa, killing at least 10 people and injuring 43, Ukraine\u2019s Interior Ministry said.",
      "Washington is easing limits on what Ukraine can strike with its American-made Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMs, U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Sunday, after months of ruling out such a move over fears of escalating the conflict and bringing about a direct confrontation between Russia and NATO.",
      "The Kremlin was swift in its condemnation.",
      "\u201cIt is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia went further at a U.N. Security Council meeting marking 1,000 days of war, saying Moscow is \u201castounded\u201d that the leaders of Britain and France \"are eager to play into the hands of the exiting administration and are dragging not just their countries but the entire Europe into large-scale escalation with drastic consequences.\"",
      "The scope of the new firing guidelines isn\u2019t clear. But the change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said North Korean troops are in Russia and apparently are being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops from Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "Biden\u2019s decision almost entirely was triggered by North Korea's entry into the fight, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, and was made just before he left for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.",
      "Russia also is slowly pushing Ukraine\u2019s outnumbered army backward in the eastern Donetsk region. It has also conducted a devastating aerial campaign against civilian areas in Ukraine.",
      "Peskov referred journalists to a statement from President Vladimir Putin in September in which he said allowing Ukraine to target Russia would significantly raise the stakes.",
      "It would change \u201cthe very nature of the conflict dramatically,\u201d Putin said at the time. \u201cThis will mean that NATO countries \u2014 the United States and European countries \u2014 are at war with Russia.\u201d",
      "Peskov claimed that Western countries supplying longer-range weapons also provide targeting services to Kyiv. \u201cThis fundamentally changes the modality of their involvement in the conflict,\u201d he said.",
      "Putin warned in June that Moscow could provide longer-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allowed Ukraine to use its allies' arms to attack Russian territory. After signing a treaty with North Korea, Putin issued an explicit threat to provide weapons to Pyongyang, noting Moscow could mirror Western arguments that it\u2019s up to Ukraine to decide how to use them.",
      "\u201cThe Westerners supply weapons to Ukraine and say: \u2018We do not control anything here anymore and it does not matter how they are used,\u2019\" Putin has said. \"Well, we can also say: \u2018We supplied something to someone \u2014 and then we do not control anything.\u2019 And let them think about it.\u201d",
      "Putin has also reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s readiness to use nuclear weapons if it sees a threat to its sovereignty.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue military support to Ukraine. He has also vowed to end the war quickly.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a muted response Sunday to the approval that he and his government have request for over a year, adding: \"The missiles will speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe longer Ukraine can strike, the shorter the war will be,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Monday before the U.N. Security Council meeting marking the 1,000th-day milestone.",
      "Asked whether the United Kingdom would follow the United States in authorizing use of its longer-range missiles, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who chaired the meeting, declined to comment. He said doing so would risk \u201coperational security and can only play into the hands of Putin.\u201d",
      "France's U.N. Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere, whose country has also given Ukraine longer-range missiles, told the Security Council without directly saying what his country will do that \u201cThe right of Ukraine to its legitimate defense includes the possibility of striking military targets involved in operations aimed at the territory.\u201d",
      "Ukraine's Sybiha said a green light from the U.S. to use longer-range missiles against Russia \u201ccould be a game changer,\u201d but others are less certain.",
      "ATACMS, which have a range of about 300 kilometers (190 miles), can reach far behind the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line in Ukraine, but they have relatively short range compared with other types of ballistic and cruise missiles.",
      "The policy change came \u201ctoo late to have a major strategic effect,\u201d said Patrick Bury, a senior associate professor in security at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate kind of impact it will have is to probably slow down the tempo of the Russian offensives which are now happening,\u201d he said, adding that Ukraine could strike targets in Kursk or logistics hubs or command headquarters.",
      "Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, agreed the U.S. move would not alter the war's course, noting Ukraine \"would need large stockpiles of ATACMS, which it doesn\u2019t have and won\u2019t receive because the United States\u2019 own supplies are limited.\u201d",
      "On a political level, the move \u201cis a boost to the Ukrainians and it gives them a window of opportunity to try and show that they are still viable and worth supporting\u201d as Trump prepares to take office, said Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "The cue for the policy change was the arrival in Russia of North Korean troops, according to Glib Voloskyi, an analyst at the CBA Initiatives Center, a Kyiv-based think tank.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:50:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Survivors of clergy sexual abuse are urging the Vatican to adopt the same zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002",
    "story": [
      "Survivors of clergy sexual abuse are urging the Vatican to adopt the same zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002",
      "ROME -- Survivors of clergy sexual abuse urged the Vatican on Monday to expand its zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002 to the rest of the world, arguing that children everywhere should be protected from predator priests.",
      "The U.S. norms, adopted at the height of the abuse scandal there, say a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established under church law.",
      "That \u201cone strike and you\u2019re out\u201d policy in the U.S. has long stood out as the toughest in the church. It is held up by some as the gold standard, by others as excessive and by still others as imperfect but better than most. It was adopted by U.S. bishops as they scrambled to try to regain credibility following the revelations of abuse and cover-up in Boston documented by the Boston Globe\u2019s \u201cSpotlight\u201d series.",
      "Since then, the church abuse scandal has erupted globally, and survivors from around the world said Monday there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. norms couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be applied universally. They called for changes in the church\u2019s in-house canon law and reasoned they could be approved since the Holy See already approved the norms for the U.S. church.",
      "\u201cDespite Pope Francis\u2019 repeated calls for zero tolerance on abuse, his words have yet to lead to any real action,\u201d said Gemma Hickey, a transgender survivor of abuse and the president of the global survivor network Ending Clergy Abuse.",
      "The proposal launched at a press conference was hammered out during an unusual meeting in June in Rome between survivors and some of the Catholic hierarchy's top priestly experts on preventing abuse. It was described by participants at the time as a \u201chistoric collaboration\u201d between two groups that often talk past one another, given victims' deep distrust of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "The priestly participants in that meeting included the Rev. Hans Zollner, who heads the church\u2019s main academic think tank on safeguarding; the No. 2 at the Vatican\u2019s child protection advisory board, Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera; and the Gregorian University\u2019s canon law dean, the Rev. Ulrich Rhode as well as diplomats from the U.S., Australian and other embassies.",
      "However, there was apparently no one from the Vatican legal office, secretariat of state or the discipline section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which processes all abuse cases worldwide and largely sets policy on applying the church\u2019s canon law \u2014 albeit in secret since its cases are never published.",
      "As a result, it was unclear what would become of the proposed policy changes, given the U.S. norms only came about because U.S. bishops pushed the Vatican to approve them, driven by their outraged flocks and insurance companies.",
      "Nicholas Cafardi, a U.S. canon lawyer who was an original member of the U.S. National Review Board that provided input to the 2002 U.S. norms, said globalizing that policy into universal church law \u201cwould be one of the logical next steps\u201d for Francis to take to continue the fight against abuse.",
      "But Cafardi, author of \u201cBefore Dallas,\u201d about the lead-up to the 2002 Dallas bishops' meeting that approved the norms, said that some bishops today bristle at how the policy limits their authority and freedom. And in a telephone interview, he noted that even in the U.S., the norms are only still in place because the U.S. bishops keep formally asking to keep them, which he acknowledged was a \u201cweakness\u201d in the system.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that a good protection would be \u2018Let\u2019s just make it universal law,\u2019\u201d said Cafardi. \u201cOnce you have that law, you don\u2019t have to worry about the bishops asking for it in country after country. It\u2019s just the law.\"",
      "However, the proposal faces an uphill battle since the Vatican in recent years has repeatedly insisted on \u201cproportionality\u201d in its sentences for abuse, refusing to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and taking into account cultural differences in countries where abuse isn't as openly discussed as it is in the West.",
      "That has resulted in seemingly light punishments for even confirmed cases of abuse which, in the U.S., would have resulted in a priest being permanently removed from ministry.",

      "German police have broken up a protest camp housing environmental activists in a forest near the Tesla electric car factory in Gr\u00fcnheide outside Berlin, citing violations of public safety and order",
      "BERLIN -- German police broke up a protest camp housing environmental activists in a forest near the Tesla electric car factory in Gr\u00fcnheide outside Berlin on Tuesday, citing violations of public safety and order.",
      "The protesters had occupied a pine forest near billionaire Elon Musk's first European Tesla plant since the end of February over concerns about water and deforestation.",
      "Tesla wants to expand its site in Gr\u00fcnheide for a freight station and storage areas and buy a wooded area from the state of Brandenburg, where the plant is based, for that purpose.",
      "Police first were deployed at the protest camp on Monday to temporarily evacuate parts of the camp with tree houses due to a planned search for explosive ordnance from World War II. However, the activists refused to leave and instead climbed high up some of the trees, German news agency dpa reported. Police eventually pulled six people out of tree houses who did not want to leave voluntarily.",
      "Tuesday's complete breakup of the camp came because the activists repeatedly violated regulations and committed criminal offenses, local police spokesperson Daniel Keip told dpa. He said it was also not possible to establish contact with the leaders of the protests and it could no longer be assumed that the protest would remain peaceful.",
      "The site near the factory has been under investigation for suspected ordnance left from World War II for some time. Unexploded bombs are still found frequently in Germany almost 80 years after the end of the war, and often during work on construction sites. They are usually defused or disposed of in controlled explosions, a process that sometimes entails large-scale evacuations as a precaution."

      "Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the biggest case under a national security law that critics say has crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city",
      "HONG KONG -- Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.",
      "The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. They face sentences of up to life imprisonment.",
      "The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader.",
      "Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms.",
      "Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant.",
      "Here are profiles of some of the leading activists.",
      "Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters \u2014 over 13% of the city\u2019s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election.",
      "The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a \u201cconstitutional weapon of mass destruction\" that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city\u2019s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature.",
      "The judges said Tai aimed to \u201cundermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure\u201d of Hong Kong.",
      "Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported non-violence and believed his actions were legal.",
      "Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022.",
      "Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city\u2019s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and brought traffic to a standstill in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city\u2019s leader.",
      "Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city\u2019s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement.",
      "In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named \u201cDemosisto\u201d with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who \u201cbegged for interference\u201d by foreign forces.",
      "Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped \u201che could part with his history and would be able to reform himself\u201d after completing it.",
      "Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service.",
      "Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him.",
      "Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals.",
      "Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty.",
      "The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai.",
      "In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.",

      "The approval of the document demonstrates Putin\u2019s readiness to tap his nuclear arsenal to force the West to back down as Moscow presses a slow-moving offensive in Ukraine as the war reached its 1,000th day.",
      "Asked Tuesday if a Ukrainian attack with longer-range U.S. missiles could potentially trigger a nuclear response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov answered affirmatively, pointing to the doctrine\u2019s provision that holds the door open for it after a conventional strike that raises critical threats for the \"sovereignty and territorial integrity: of Russia and its ally, Belarus.",
      "Commenting on whether the updated doctrine was deliberately issued to follow Biden\u2019s decision, Peskov said the document was published \u201cin a timely manner\u201d and that Putin instructed the government to update it earlier this year so that it is \u201cin line with the current situation.\u201d",
      "Putin first announced changes in the nuclear doctrine in September, when he chaired a meeting discussing the proposed revisions. He has previously warned the U.S. and other NATO allies that allowing Ukraine to use Western-supplied longer-range weapons to hit Russian territory would mean that Russia and NATO are at war.",
      "Washington has permitted Ukraine to use the longer-range weapons on targets inside Russia after declaring that thousands of North Korean troops were deployed in the Russian region of Kursk to fight an incursion by Kyiv's forces.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m unfortunately not surprised by the comments the Kremlin has made around the publication of this new, revised document,\" said U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller, adding that since the war began, Russia has sought to \"coerce and intimidate both Ukraine and other countries around the world through irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and behavior.\"",
      "He added that Washington has not seen any reason \"to adjust our own nuclear posture, but we will continue to call on Russia to stop bellicose and irresponsible rhetoric.\u201d",
      "A U.S. National Security Council official who was not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity underscored that the arrival of thousands of North Korea soldiers to take part in combat operations against Ukraine was a major escalation by Moscow that demanded a response.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the \"irresponsible rhetoric coming from Russia, and that is not going to deter our support for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re now on Day 1,000 of a conflict. That\u2019s 1000 days of Russian aggression, 1,000 days of sacrifices in Ukraine,\" he said at the G-20 summit in Brazil. \"We have stood with Ukraine from the start. I\u2019ve been doubling down in my clear message that we need to ensure Ukraine has what is needed for as long as needed to win this war against Putin.\u201d",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in Warsaw that her country would not be intimidated by Russia\u2019s new policy, saying her country made the mistake of cowering in the face of Moscow's aggression in the past but would not do so again.",
      "In Warsaw, Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski described the revised Russian nuclear doctrine as a tacit acknowledgement that Moscow\u2019s conventional forces are weaker than NATO.",
      "The updated doctrine says an attack against Russia by a nonnuclear power with the \u201cparticipation or support of a nuclear power\u201d will be seen as their \u201cjoint attack on the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "It says any massive aerial attack on Russia could trigger a nuclear response but avoids any firm commitment and mentions the \u201cuncertainty of scale, time and place of possible use of nuclear deterrent\u201d among the key principles of the nuclear deterrence.",
      "The document also notes that aggression against Russia by a member of a military bloc or coalition is viewed as \"an aggression by the entire bloc,\" a clear reference to NATO.",
      "At the same time, it spells out conditions for using nuclear weapons in greater detail compared with previous versions of the doctrine, noting they could be used in case of a massive air attack involving ballistic and cruise missiles, aircraft, drones and other flying vehicles.",
      "The formulation appears to significantly broaden the triggers for possible nuclear weapons use compared with the document's previous version, which stated Russia could tap its atomic arsenal if case of an attack with ballistic missiles.",
      "President Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years and has relied on Russian subsidies and support, has allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to send troops into Ukraine and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine, he and other Russian voices have frequently threatened the West with Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal to discourage it from ramping up support for Kyiv.",
      "Russian hawks called for toughening the doctrine for months, arguing the previous version failed to deter the West from increasing its aid to Ukraine and created the impression that Moscow would not resort to nuclear weapons.",

      "US envoy Amos Hochstein says an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d after meeting with officials in Lebanon",
      "BEIRUT -- A United States envoy said an agreement to end the Israel-Hezbollah war is \u201cwithin our grasp\u201d after talks in Lebanon on Tuesday.",
      "However, there was no such optimism in the Gaza Strip, where the looting of nearly 100 aid trucks by armed men worsened an already severe food crisis.",
      "Amos Hochstein, the Biden administration\u2019s pointman on Israel and Lebanon, arrived as Hezbollah\u2019s allies in the Lebanese government said it had responded positively to the proposal, which would entail both the militants and Israeli ground forces withdrawing from a U.N. buffer zone in southern Lebanon.",
      "The buffer zone would be policed by thousands of additional U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops. Israel has called for a stronger enforcement mechanism, potentially including the ability to operate against any Hezbollah threats, something Lebanon is likely to oppose.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on Tuesday hit a Lebanese army center in the southern town of Sarafand, killing three soldiers, the army said \u2013 the second deadly strike on Lebanese soldiers in as many days. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military. At least 38 soldiers have been killed by Israeli bombardment the past month, according to the Lebanese army.",
      "Hochstein said he had held \u201cvery constructive talks\u201d with Lebanon\u2019s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an ally of Hezbollah who is mediating on the group\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cSpecifically today, we have continued to significantly narrow the gaps,\u201d the envoy told reporters after the two-hour meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately the decisions of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict...It is now within our grasp.\u201d",
      "Berri said the \"situation is good in principle,\u201d though some unresolved technical details remain. The Lebanese side was now waiting to hear the results of Hochstein's talks with Israeli officials, he told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.",
      "The theft in Gaza over the weekend of nearly 100 trucks loaded with food and other humanitarian aid sent prices soaring and caused shortages in central Gaza, where most of the population of 2.3 million people have fled and where hundreds of thousands are crammed into squalid tent camps.",
      "Experts say famine may already have set in in the north, where Israel has been waging a weekslong offensive that has killed hundreds of people and driven tens of thousands from their homes.",
      "On Monday, a crowd of people waited outside a shuttered bakery in the central city of Deir al-Balah. A woman who had been displaced from Gaza City, identifying herself as Umm Shadi, said the price of flour had climbed to 400 shekels (over $100) a bag, if it can even be found.",
      "Nora Muhanna, also displaced from Gaza City, said she was leaving empty-handed after waiting five hours for a bag of bread for her children. \u201cFrom the beginning, there are no goods, and even if they are available, there is no money,\u201d she said.",
      "The United Nations said armed men stole food and other aid from 98 trucks over the weekend, the largest single incident of its kind since the war began. It did not say who was behind the theft.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the convoy of 109 trucks was instructed by the Israeli military to take an \u201calternative, unfamiliar route\u201d after the aid was brought through the Kerem Shalom crossing, and that the trucks were robbed near the crossing itself.",
      "Israel accuses criminal gangs and Hamas of stealing aid, allegations denied by the militant group.",
      "Al-Aqsa TV, operated by the militants, said Hamas-run security forces in Gaza had launched an operation against looters, killing 20 of them.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official based abroad, said the looters were young Bedouins who operate east of Rafah near Israeli military positions.",
      "The Hamas-run government had a police force that maintained public security before the war, but they have vanished in many areas after being targeted by Israeli strikes. Hamas says it has taken measures to prevent looting and price-gouging in markets.",
      "But the biggest problem is not theft \u2013 it\u2019s the low amount of aid Israel allows into Gaza, said Tamara Alrifai, communications director for UNRWA, the U.N. agency with the biggest role in the humanitarian operation.",
      "\u201cTake aid into a war zone a few trucks at a time, what do we expect a displaced, hungry and traumatized population to do?\u201d she said of the theft.",
      "The flow of aid is at nearly the lowest level of the entire 13-month war. So far this month, Israel says it let into Gaza an average of 88 trucks a day \u2013 less than half the highest rate of the war, in April, which aid groups say was still too low.",
      "From the aid that does enter, UNRWA says only about half actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions and fears of theft often prevent the agency from collecting truck cargos at the border.",
      "Israel says it puts no restrictions on the quantity of aid entering Gaza and that it is working to increase the amount. This month, it opened a new crossing into central Gaza. So far it has reported a few dozen trucks entering through it.",
      "Hamas ignited the war in Gaza when its fighters stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of them believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed almost 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel the day after the Hamas attack in what it said was solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, and all-out war erupted in September.",
      "Israeli bombardment has killed more than 3,500 people in Lebanon and wounded almost 15,000, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It also displaced nearly 1.2 million, or a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population. On the Israeli side, 87 soldiers and 50 civilians have been killed by rockets, drones and missiles, and tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from homes near the border.",

      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Philippine counterpart, Gilberto Teodoro, signed the legally binding General Security of Military Information Agreement in Manila at a time when the longtime treaty allies have boosted their defense and military engagements, including large-scale joint combat drills, largely in response to China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in Asia.",
      "The outgoing Biden administration has taken steps to strengthen an arc of military alliances across the Indo-Pacific region to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan or in the disputed South China Sea, which Beijing has claimed almost in its entirety.",
      "That has dovetailed with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.\u2019s thrust to strengthen his country\u2019s external defenses given an alarming escalation of territorial confrontations between Chinese and Filipinos forces in the South China Sea.",
      "The Department of National Defense in Manila said the agreement aims to ensure the security of classified military information that would be exchanged between the U.S. and the Philippines.",
      "It will \u201callow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States,\u201d the Philippine defense department said.",
      "Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement.",
      "Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to ones Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems.",
      "It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept highly secure to prevent possible leaks, the two Philippine officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly.",
      "Philippine efforts to obtain sophisticated weapons from the U.S. military in the past have been hampered by a lack of such an intelligence deal, including when Filipino forces were scrambling to fight a 2017 siege by Filipino and foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group in southern Marawi city. Philippine forces, backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes, quelled the uprising after five months.",
      "Austin and Teodoro also attended a groundbreaking ceremony for a center where the U.S. and Philippine militaries would coordinate future joint operations, including the exchange of information. Austin said the center \u201cwill be a place where our forces can work side-by-side to respond to regional challenges.\"",
      "Austin renewed the U.S. commitment to the Philippines as an ally and told Teodoro that \u201cwe are more than allies. We are family.\"",
      "The coordinating center, Teodoro said, would provide \u201ca unified picture of the shared areas of responsibility and common approaches to threats against both our securities.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m sure it will benefit future generations of both our peoples to come because although we may change people, the values don\u2019t change,\u201d Teodoro said.",
      "The Philippine defense chief reiterated the crucial need for the U.S. security presence in the region, citing Marcos\u2019s repeated statements that such a presence \u201cis essential for maintaining peace and stability in this region.\"",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Typhoon Man-yi left at least seven people dead in a landslide, destroyed houses and displaced large numbers of villagers before blowing away from the northern Philippines, worsening the crisis wreaked by multiple back-to-back storms, officials said Monday.",
      "Man-yi was one of the strongest of the six major storms to hit the northern Philippines in less than a month and had sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour when it slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In Manila and offered his prayers, announcing an additional $1 million in humanitarian aid for typhoon victims. He told Marcos he has authorized U.S. troops to help Filipino forces provide lifesaving aid.",
      "Torrential rains and fierce wind unleashed by Man-yi set off a landslide early Monday in the northern town of Ambaguio in Nueva Vizcaya province that buried a house and killed seven people, including children, and injured three others inside, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Antonio P. Marallag Jr. said.",
      "Army troops, police and villagers were scrambling to search for three other people who were believed to have been entombed in the avalanche of mud, boulders and uprooted trees, Marallag said.",
      "Disaster response officials said they were checking if the deaths of two villagers in a motorcycle accident and an electrocution were directly related to Man-yi\u2019s onslaught so they could be added to the overall death toll. They said a separate search was underway for a couple and their child after their shanty was swept away in rampaging rivers in northern Nueva Ecija province.",
      "More than a million people were affected by the typhoon and two previous storms, including nearly 700,000 who fled their homes and moved to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, according to the Official of Civil Defense.",
      "Nearly 8,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 100 cities and towns were hit by power outages due to toppled electric posts, it said.",
      "In the worst-hit province of Camarines, officials pleaded for additional help after fierce winds and rain damaged more houses and cut off electricity and water supplies in the entire province, along with cellphone connections in many areas, provincial information officer Camille Gianan said.",
      "Welfare officials transported food aid, drinking water and other help but more is needed over the coming months, Gianan said. Many villagers will need construction materials to rebuild their houses, she said.",
      "\u201cThey have not recovered from the previous storms when the super typhoon hit,\u201d Gianan told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s been one calamity after another.\u201d",
      "The rare number of back-to-back storms and typhoons that lashed Luzon \u2014 the country's largest and most populous island \u2014 in just three weeks left more than 160 people dead, affected 9 million people and caused such extensive damage to communities, infrastructure and farmlands that the Philippines may have to import more rice, a staple food.",
      "In an emergency meeting as Man-yi approached, Marcos asked his Cabinet and provincial officials to brace for \u201cthe worst-case scenario.\"",
      "At least 26 domestic airports and two international airports were briefly shut and inter-island ferry and cargo services were suspended due to rough seas, stranding thousands of passengers and commuters.

      "The U.S., Manila\u2019s treaty ally, along with Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei provided cargo aircraft and other storm aid to help the government\u2019s overwhelmed disaster-response agencies. Last month, the first major storm, Trami, left scores of people dead after dumping one to two months\u2019 worth of rain in just 24 hours in several towns.",
      "The Philippines is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It\u2019s often hit by earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the world\u2019s most disaster-prone countries."

      "\u201cBecause the universe goes on expanding, we are all uneasy. With the chill of two billion light-years of solitude, I suddenly sneezed,\u201d is the way the poem ends, as translated by William I. Elliott and Kazuo Kawamura.",
      "When asked about it, Tanikawa acknowledged it felt as though someone else had written it, but noted he still thought it was a good poem.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

      "PASTEF is projected to win around 131 out of the 165 seats in the National Assembly, according to local media and citizen vote counting platforms, giving Faye\u2019s party an absolute majority. The official results and number of seats won by each party will be announced later this week.",

      "Figures released Monday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos and their online partners won $213.6 million in October, surpassing September's previous record of $208 million.",
      "When in-person casino winnings, internet and sports betting revenue are included, the nine casinos, two horse tracks that take sports bets and their online partners won just under $500 million in October, an increase of 2.6% from a year ago.",

      "And that business continues to lag for two-thirds of the casinos. Only three casinos \u2014 Borgata, Hard Rock and Ocean \u2014 won more from in-person gamblers last month than they did in October 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "The swing toward internet gambling and away from in-person casino gambling accelerated during the pandemic, and is becoming a more permanent feature of New Jersey's gambling landscape.",
      "Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said the trend is becoming more obvious.",
      "\u201cDespite a historically dry and very mild October, brick-and-mortar gaming operators in Atlantic City did not see strong gains over 2023, instead declining by 8.5% year-over-year,\u201d she said.",
      "But total revenue for the casinos was up over 9% from a year ago, \u201cin no small part due to internet gaming, which continued a record streak,\u201d she said.",
      "James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, noted that internet revenue surpassed in-person casino revenue for the first time in October, excluding the few months in 2020 when the physical casinos were closed due to the pandemic.",
      "He also noted that internet gambling revenue exceeded $200 million for the second straight month.",
      "\u201cThese two accomplishments are emblematic of the importance of online gaming as a component of the evolving casino business,\u201d he said.",
      "In terms of in-person gambling revenue, Borgata won $53.4 million, down 6.1% from a year earlier; Hard Rock won $40.8 million, down 1%; Ocean won $32.8 million, down over 24%; Tropicana won $17.6 million, up 7.4%; Harrah's won $15.7 million, down 11.5%; Caesars won just under $15 million, up 4.1%; Resorts won $12 million, down over 9%; Bally's won $11.4 million, down 7.8%; and Golden Nugget won $9.6 million, down over 20%.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump chose Howard Lutnick, head of brokerage and investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald and a cryptocurrency enthusiast, as his nominee for commerce secretary, a position in which he'd have a key role in carrying out Trump's plans to raise and enforce tariffs.",
      "Trump made the announcement Tuesday on his social media platform, Truth Social. In the post, Trump said Lutnick \u201cwill lead our Tariff and Trade agenda, with additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative.\"",

      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \u201ctariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\" Trump on the campaign trail proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.",
      "Mainstream economists are generally skeptical of tariffs, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity.",

      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "WASHINGTON -- Fossil fuel executive Chris Wright, Donald Trump's choice for Energy secretary, is a strong supporter of oil and gas development, including fracking, a key pillar of the president-elect\u2019s quest for U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market.",
      "Wright has been one of the industry\u2019s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change, and he could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals by the Biden administration.",
      "CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, he describes himself as \u201ca tech nerd turned entrepreneur\u201d and promotes the idea that more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe.",
      "Here are some things to know about Wright.",
      "Wright has been chairman and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no experience in government.",
      "Liberty is a major energy industry service provider, with a focus on technology. Wright, who grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",
      "Wright says on LinkedIn that he is \u201call-in on energy,\u2033 from starting his career in nuclear, solar and geothermal energy to his current efforts in oil and gas and \u201cnext-generation\u201d geothermal. \u201cI don\u2019t care where energy comes (from), as long as it is secure, reliable, affordable and betters human lives,\u2033 he wrote.",

The council\u2019s mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by Democratic President Joe Biden, who has made fighting climate change a top priority.",

Hamm helped organize an event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to donate $1 billion to Trump\u2019s campaign, with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.",
      "Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group that supports fossil fuels, called Wright \u201can excellent choice\u201d for energy secretary. Pyle led Trump\u2019s energy transition team in 2016.",

      "Wright has frequently criticized what he calls a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to climate change by liberal and left-wing groups. He argues that the climate movement around the world is \u201ccollapsing under its own weight.\u201d",
      "Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called Wright \u201ca champion of dirty fossil fuels\u201d and said his nomination was \u201ca disastrous mistake.\u201d",

Now, with unfair competition from South American products boosted with hormones and GMOs, it\u2019s the final straw.\"",
      "Armelle Fraiture, a 25-year-old who took over her family's 300-cow farm in the Beauvais region earlier in the year, expressed concerns about the prospect of South American beef products hitting the French market.",
      "\u201cMy partner and I want to do this for the rest of our lives, but we don\u2019t earn much from our farm right now,\u201d said Fraiture, who is a representative of Jeunesse Agricole Oise, a local union for young farmers. \u201cI feel that the horizon is bleak and that our work is disrespected.\u201d",
      "Elsewhere, protesters burned vine stems in Bordeaux and blocked the \u201cEurope Bridge\u201d in Strasbourg. The FNSEA, one of France\u2019s main farming unions, reported over 85 demonstrations nationwide Monday.",
      "Proponents of the agreement argue that it would significantly boost economic ties between Europe and South America by eliminating tariffs on European exports, notably for machinery, chemicals and cars, thereby enhancing market access and creating lucrative opportunities for European businesses.",
      "The EU and the Mercosur trade bloc, composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, reached an initial agreement in 2019, but negotiations stumbled due to opposition from farmers and some European governments, particularly France.",
      "\u201cIt is unacceptable as it stands,\u201d said French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot.",
      "But France's hands might be tied.",
      "There are fears the agreement could be finalized at the G20 summit in Brazil this week, or in the coming weeks. A partial deal, with many of the parts that French farmers find unsavory, could be agreed over their heads since France does not hold veto power.",
      "Other nations like Germany and Spain would like to see a far-reaching deal with their South American counterparts.",
      "\u201cThere is a certain mythology surrounding Mercosur,\u201d said Spanish Farm Minister Luis Planas Puchades, who argues there is more at stake than just farming.",
      "\u201cIs the European Union interested, at this moment, in closing in on itself?\u201d he asked ahead of an EU farm ministerial meeting on Monday. \u201cOr is it interested, in this particular geopolitical context that we are experiencing, and especially after the North American election, in expanding the network of our trade agreements with third countries to maintain our economic and commercial influence as well? I think the answer is very clear.\u201d",
      "Leading the new protests in France are unions, who oppose provisions such as duty-free imports of beef, poultry and sugar, which they say create unfair competition. Coordination Rurale, a union linked to the far right, has promised an \u201cagricultural revolt,\u201d including food freight blockades beginning Tuesday in Auch and Agen in southwestern France.",
      "Earlier this year, farmers staged protests across France and elsewhere in Europe to protest EU regulations and financial problems, demand fairer agricultural policies and oppose the trade agreement.",
      "French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard has publicly opposed the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, citing risks of deforestation and health concerns linked to hormone-treated meat.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron has also criticized the agreement unless South American producers meet EU standards.",
      "Farmers say they are further frustrated by a European Commission audit that flagged hormone use in Brazilian beef exports. Their demonstrations aim to pressure the French government and EU officials to block or renegotiate the agreement.",

    "summary": "British farmers have descended on Parliament to protest a tax hike they say will deal a &ldquo;hammer blow&rdquo; to struggling family farms",
    "story": [
      "British farmers have descended on Parliament to protest a tax hike they say will deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to struggling family farms",
      "LONDON -- With banners, bullhorns and toy tractors, thousands of British farmers descended on Parliament on Tuesday to protest a tax hike they say will deal a \u201chammer blow\u201d to struggling family farms.",
      "U.K. farmers are rarely as militant as their European neighbors, and Britain has not seen large-scale protests like those that have snarled cities in France and other European countries. Now, though, farmers say they will step up their action if the government doesn\u2019t listen.",
      "The flashpoint is the government\u2019s decision in its budget last month to scrap a tax break dating from the 1990s that exempts agricultural property from inheritance tax. From April 2026, farms worth more than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) face a 20% tax when the owner dies and they are passed on to the next generation.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s mad,\u201d said Olly Harrison, co-organizer of a protest that flooded the streets around Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s Downing Street office. He said many \u201cwant to take to the streets and block roads and go full French.\u201d",
      "Organizers urged protesters not to bring farm machinery into central London, though a handful of tractors drove past Downing Street festooned with signs saying \u201cthe final straw\u201d and \u201cno farmers, no food.\u201d",
      "They were cheered by a crowd that police estimated at 13,000. Some held signs proclaiming \u201cStand with a farmer, not Starmer.\u201d",
      "Children on toy tractors looped round Parliament Square after a rally addressed by speakers including former \u201cTop Gear\u201d TV host and celebrity farmer Jeremy Clarkson. Another 1,800 farmers were invited into Parliament for a \u201cmass lobby\u201d organized by the National Farmers\u2019 Union.",
      "\u201cThe human impact of this policy is simply not acceptable, it\u2019s wrong,\" NFU President Tom Bradshaw said. \u201cIt\u2019s kicking the legs out from under British food security.\"",
      "Volatile weather exacerbated by climate change, global instability and the upheaval caused by Britain\u2019s 2020 departure from the European Union have all added to the burden on farmers. Many feel the Labour Party government\u2019s tax change, part of an effort to raise billions of pounds to fund public services, is the last straw.",
      "\u201cFour out of the last five years, we\u2019ve lost money,\u201d said Harrison, a fifth-generation farmer who grows cereal crops near Liverpool in northwest England. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s kept me going is doing it for my kids. And maybe a little bit of appreciation on the land allows you to keep borrowing, to keep going. But now that\u2019s just disappeared overnight.\u201d",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left government says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of farms -\u2013 about 75% \u2014 will not have to pay inheritance tax, and various loopholes mean that a farming couple can pass on an estate worth up to 3 million pounds ($3.9 million) to their children tax-free. The 20% levy is half the 40% inheritance tax paid on other land and property in the U.K.",
      "Starmer spokeswoman Camilla Marshall said the tax decision had been \u201cdifficult\u201d but was not being reconsidered.",
      "Supporters of the tax say it will recoup money from wealthy people who have bought up agricultural land as an investment, driving up the cost of farmland.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become the most effective way for the super rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax,\u201d Environment Secretary Steve Reed wrote in The Daily Telegraph, adding that high land prices were \u201crobbing young farmers of the dream of owning their own farm.\u201d",
      "But the farmers\u2019 union says more than 60% of working farms could face a tax hit. And while farms may be worth a lot on paper, profits are often small. Government figures show that income for most types of farms fell in the year ending February 2024, in some cases by more than 70%. Average farm income ranged from about 17,000 pounds ($21,000) for grazing livestock farms to 143,000 pounds ($180,000) for specialist poultry farms.",
      "The last decade has been turbulent. Many British farmers backed Brexit as a chance to get out of the EU\u2019s complex and much-criticized Common Agricultural Policy. Since then, the U.K. has brought in changes such as paying farmers to restore nature and promote biodiversity, as well as for producing food.",
      "Some farmers have welcomed those moves, but many feel goodwill was squandered through bureaucratic bungling \u2014 by previous Conservative governments as well as Starmer's Labour administration \u2014 alongside a failure of subsidies to keep up with inflation and new trade deals with countries including Australia and New Zealand that have opened the door to cheap imports.",
      "National Farmers\u2019 Union Deputy President David Exwood said the government has \u201ccompletely blown their trust with the industry.\u201d",
      "Heidi Fermor, who helps run her family\u2019s fruit, vegetable and arable farm in southeast England, said she was attending her first protest because government officials had \u201cno idea\u201d about the reality of farmers\u2019 lives.",
      "\u201cFarming is hard. We\u2019re very privileged, we have a lovely life, but it\u2019s hard,\" she said. \"We want to farm for life, for future generations, not just for today.\u201d"

      "The family of a worker killed in an explosion at a Louisville manufacturing plant says they begged authorities to search the wreckage for his remains after they were told all employees were accounted for",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The family of a worker killed last week in an explosion at a Louisville manufacturing plant said Monday they begged authorities to search the wreckage for his remains after they were told all employees were accounted for.",
      "Kevens Dawson Jr.'s body was found inside the Givaudan Color Sense plant after rescuers returned to the building late in the night at the family's urging, Dawson's girlfriend, Malaika Watson, told reporters Monday.",
      "The Nov. 12 afternoon explosion at the factory that makes colorings for the food industry rocked the surrounding neighborhood, left two workers dead and injured 11. Dozens of homes around the plant in eastern Louisville had their windows shattered and the percussion from the blast knocked pictures off walls and cracked drywall in some homes. Investigators said Monday they believe a cooking vessel in the plant overheated, causing the blast.",
      "Lawyers retained by Dawson's family pledged to find the cause of the blast and why Dawson was unaccounted for for several hours.",
      "\u201cWe're going to get to the bottom of everything that happened here, so none of the family has to go through what Kevens Dawson's family is going through today,\u201d Ben Crump, a high-profile civil rights attorney, said at an afternoon news conference Monday.",
      "Dawson's family said he worked at the plant for just over a year and would have turned 50 years old this week. He had three adult children.",
      "Watson became emotional as she recounted how she was told to go to three different hospitals to see if Dawson had been admitted. She was told there were two workers in critical condition, but neither was Dawson. She returned to the site of the plant at around 7 p.m., but was turned away by officers at the scene.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to go in,\u201d she said.",
      "Watson ran through a gap in the fence and nearly made it to the wreckage of the plant before she was pulled away. She remained at the scene for hours afterward.",
      "\u201cNot until 11:30 (p.m.) did they say, \u2018Oh, we found someone else,\u2019\u201d Watson said. \u201cBut it was too late.\u201d",
      "Watson said her boyfriend, who served in the Army, was the \u201cstrongest man I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not just a man. He\u2019s a man\u2019s man, and all he wanted to do was work and provide for his family,\u201d Watson said, fighting through tears.",
      "Louisville officials said they were initially told by the company that all employees were accounted for, though that information was wrong, so firefighters went back into the dangerous scene. When Dawson was found, he was pronounced dead at the scene, fire officials said last week.",
      "Crump and a team of attorneys said Monday they have not filed a lawsuit, but are doing an investigation of the blast. An explosion at the same plant in 2003 killed one worker.",
      "The president of the plant told reporters last week the company is accountable for the accident and will pay damages to residents affected by the blast.",
      "A special response team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted a multi-day investigation and said Monday that preliminary findings indicate it was a cooking vessel that overheated. They said there were no hazardous materials involved in the explosion and it was not caused by any \u201cnefarious act by any individual on site the day of the explosion.\u201d",
      "Later in the evening, leadership from Givaudan hosted a community meeting, where tensions rose as residents complained that the company has not been responsive to their needs in the aftermath of the explosion.",
      "Company president Ann Leonard told residents it's likely the plant will move out of the neighborhood, which was met with cheers. But many remained irritated that company officials have not sent representatives door-to-door to check on residents.",
      "Some are still unable to move back into their homes nearly a week later.",
      "The electricity in Eunice Stone's home has remained cut off since the explosion, and she and her husband have moved into an extended stay hotel. The couple lived just a few yards away from the plant's property, and the explosion has continued to give her headaches days later, she said.",
      "\u201cThat blast was so horrible,\u201d she said after the meeting Monday night. \u201cMy head is still throbbing.\u201d"

      "One of the top remaining vacancies in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed Cabinet is his treasury secretary \u2014 and the views of his top contenders there reflect broader questions about how the president-elect might wield tariffs in his new administr...",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s decision on a treasury secretary is about far more than whose name will be printed on America\u2019s money.",
      "The choice of how to fill his highest-profile outstanding Cabinet selection will be the clearest indication yet of how he intends to wield import tariffs in his new administration.",
      "The leading candidates for the role have expressed differing perspectives on how Trump should use the protectionist trade policies that he put front and center in his campaign for the White House, while Trump himself has offered seemingly contradictory views.",
      "Billionaire investor Scott Bessent, considered a leading candidate, has talked up tariffs as a negotiating ploy. Another prominent contender, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, has expressed more support for broad tariffs. Lutnick is co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition operation and is helping put forward candidates for key roles, including the Treasury Department.",
      "Trump is also looking at other potential candidates as he decides who can best implement his economic agenda \u2014 and how big a role tariffs will play.",
      "The president-elect, during this year\u2019s campaign, portrayed the taxes on imports as both a negotiating tool to hammer out better trade terms and as a way to generate revenue to fund tax cuts elsewhere.",
      "The Republican has proposed universal tariffs of as much as 20% and taxing Chinese imports at 60% or more, yet his campaign never filled in key details about how tariffs would be imposed and whether the goal was more about funding the government or pressing trade partners.",
      "The two are competing priorities \u2014 achieving sustainable long term revenues from tariffs isn't possible if they're a negotiating tool, and sustaining them for the long term could constrain the growth Trump has promised to bring to the country.",
      "The lack of clarity has spilled over to Trump's choice of treasury secretary, as tariffs run the risk of worsening inflation and also disrupting the stock market gains since the election that have been a point of pride for the president-elect.",
      "Bessent told Bloomberg News in August that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\u201d and that tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China.",
      "In a Fox News op-ed last week, Bessent said that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\u201d",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \u201ctariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Elon Musk, who has been an influential voice at Trump's side during the transition, came out in favor of Lutnick on his social media site X.",
      "\u201cMy view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change,\u201d Musk posted. \u201cBusiness-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change.\u201d",

      "The import taxes could upset trade partners and start a trade war. They could anger investors and cause stocks to slide. They could alienate voters who backed Trump because of frustration over higher prices only to find that their coffee, T-shirts, cars and other goods all cost more.",
      "In August, the economists Mary Lovely and Kimberly Claussing found that a 60% tariff on China and separate 20% universal tariff would cost a typical U.S. household $2,600 annually.",
      "Corporate America is keeping an anxious watch on Trump\u2019s transition operation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and trying to figure out how to respond in the meantime.",
      "To be sure, picking one or the other doesn\u2019t mean Trump won\u2019t take a different path once in the White House, as was seen in his first term.",
      "That has left companies telling investors that they\u2019re planning on a wide range of scenarios, with many focused on reducing their reliance on China.",
      "When asked what policies Trump would require his treasury secretary to implement on day one, his transition team said it was focused on personnel choices.",
      "\u201cPresident-elect Trump is making decisions on who will serve in his second administration,\" said Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman and incoming White House press secretary. \"Those decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made.\u201d",
      "Major companies going into this month's election were accepting of a degree of uncertainty on tariffs, saying that they were making plans for a range of outcomes.",
      "Donald Allan, Jr., CEO of the tool-maker Stanley Black & Decker, said on an Oct. 29 earnings call that his company has been planning for the possibility of higher tariffs since the spring. He stressed there are still a lot of unknowns, but his company was unlikely to move more manufacturing jobs into the United States because \u201cit's just not cost effective to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is which scenario is going to play out and exactly how that would be. Is it going be just China? Is it going to be every country?\u201d Allan said. \u201cThose are all things that are to be determined.\"",
      "Timothy Boyle, Chairman and CEO of Columbia Sportswear, said on his Oct. 30 earnings call that his company was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about tariffs despite having a minimal exposure to Chinese imports.",
      "\u201cWe believe the arguments about tariffs improving the domestic production of items such as footwear and apparels are fallacious\u201d Boyle said.",
      "The furnishings and home goods store Williams Sonoma said about half of its imports came from China in 2018 when Trump was last president, a number that has since fallen to 25% and could drop further if tariffs are expanded.",
      "But Constellation Brands, a producer and marketer of alcoholic beverages, noted that its business was up double digits four years in row when Trump was last in the White House. CEO William Newlands played down the risk that Trump would hit Mexico with tariffs, even though Trump has talked about new tariffs on Mexican factories and the country is preparing for that possibility.",
      "Constellation is betting that Trump will mainly aim at China.",
      "\u201cThe general belief is that if there was going to be a situation related to tariffs, it\u2019s highly likely that Mexico is not the main target \u2014 it\u2019s China,\u201d Newlands said.",

    "story": [
      "This year\u2019s successful 9-1 football season for Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has an unexpected player at the helm: its first Jewish quarterback",
      "PROVO, Utah -- Shortly after sunset on Saturday, Rabbi Chaim Zippel clasped an overflowing cup of wine and a tin of smelling spices as he marked the end of the Sabbath with a small Jewish congregation at his home near Provo, which doubles as the county\u2019s only synagogue.",
      "The conclusion of the ceremony known as Havdalah set off a mad dash to change into blue and white fan gear and drive to the football stadium at nearby Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Zippel never expected to become a BYU fan, or even a football follower, but that changed when the school where 98.5% of students belong to the faith known widely as the Mormon church added its first Jewish quarterback to the roster.",
      "With Jake Retzlaff at the helm, the Cougars won nine straight games in what was shaping up to be a storied season before a loss Saturday against the Kansas Jayhawks ended their undefeated run. Even so, BYU \u2014 ranked No. 14 in the AP Top 25 \u2014 could end the season at the top of the Big 12 Conference with a chance to make the College Football Playoff.",
      "Retzlaff has earned a hero\u2019s embrace by rabbis and others in Provo's tiny but tight-knit Jewish community while also becoming a favorite of the broader BYU fan base that lovingly calls him the \u201cBYJew.\u201d",
      "One of just three Jewish students in a student body of 35,000, the quarterback and team co-captain who worked his way into the starting lineup has used his newfound stardom to teach others about his own faith while taking steps to learn more about Judaism for himself.",
      "\u201cI came here thinking I might not fit in with the culture, so this will be a place where I can just focus on school and football,\u201d Retzlaff told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I found that, in a way, I do fit. People are curious. And when everybody around you is so faith-oriented, it makes you want to explore your faith more.\u201d",
      "The junior college transfer from Corona, California, formed a fast friendship with the Utah rabbi when he came to BYU in 2023. The two began studying Judaism fundamentals each week in the campus library, which would help Retzlaff speak confidently about his faith in public and in his many required religion classes.",
      "BYU undergraduates must take classes about the Book of Mormon, the gospel of Jesus Christ and the faith's core belief that families can be together forever if marriages are performed in temples. Retzlaff said he was surprised to find many references to the Jewish people in the Book of Mormon. Some classmates and fans have even called him \u201cthe chosen one,\u201d referring to both his success on the field and a Latter-day Saint belief that members of the Jewish faith are God\u2019s chosen people.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of respect, honestly. They're putting me on a mantel sometimes, and I'm like, \u2018Whoa guys, I don't know about that,'\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Retzlaff, 21, has embraced becoming an ambassador for his faith in college football and in a state where only 0.2% of residents are Jewish. The redshirt junior wears a silver Star of David necklace on campus and attends dinners on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, at the rabbi's house during the offseason.",
      "He led Utah County\u2019s first public Hanukkah menorah lighting last year at Provo\u2019s historic courthouse, brought a kosher food truck to a team weight training and wrapped tefillin with Zippel in the BYU stadium. The tefillin ritual performed by Jewish men involves strapping black boxes containing Torah verses to the arm and forehead as a way of connecting to God.",
      "\u201cI told Jake, I said, after doing this here, after connecting to God on your terms inside the stadium, no amount of pressure will ever get to you,\u201d Zippel said. \u201cI think there's no greater example of finding your corner of the world where you're supposed to make your impact and making that impact.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff is affiliated with the Reform denomination of Judaism, which melds Jewish tradition with modern sensibilities, often prioritizing altruistic values and personal choice over a strict interpretation of Jewish law. He plays football on Friday nights and Saturdays during Shabbat and says sports have become a way to connect with his faith and to inspire young Jewish athletes.",
      "Among them is Hunter Smith, a 14-year-old high school quarterback from Chicago who flew to Utah with his dad, brother and a group of Jewish friends to watch Retzlaff play. The brothers sported Retzlaff's No. 12 jerseys, and their father Cameron wore a \u201cBYJew\u201d T-shirt depicting Retzlaff emerging from a Star of David, the most recognizable symbol of the faith.",
      "\u201cBeing the only Jewish quarterback in my area that I know of, I feel like I get to pave my own path in a way,\" Smith said during Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cJake's the only Jewish quarterback in college football, so he\u2019s someone I can relate to and is like a role model for me, someone I can really look up to.\u201d",
      "When Retzlaff lit Provo's giant menorah last December, Zippel said he was touched to hear the quarterback speak about the importance of his visibility at a time when some Jewish students didn't feel safe expressing their religious identity on their own campuses amid heightened antisemitism in the United States.",
      "His presence has been especially impactful for BYU alumna Malka Moya, 30, who had struggled to navigate her intersecting identities on the campus as someone who is both Jewish and a Latter-day Saint.",
      "\u201cJake feels very comfortable wearing his Star of David all the time,\u201d said Moya, who lives near Provo. \u201cI haven\u2019t always been very comfortable with expressing my Jewish identity. But, more recently, I feel like if he can do it, I can do it.\u201d"

      "He\u2019s gone out there and silenced critics and detractors with one impressive effort after another this season. But don\u2019t call this a revenge tour. Allen has always played with something to prove ever since he received no scholarship offers coming out of high school, went to junior college and got just one offer to the University of Wyoming.",
      "\u201cThe league has stars and he\u2019s one of them,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a tremendous talent and some guys are just made to play ball. I\u2019ve been having a lot of joy since I\u2019ve been here \u2014 we\u2019ve won every game. It\u2019s been cool.\u201d",
      "This game mattered more to Allen and the Bills than to Mahomes and the Chiefs (9-1). Buffalo has won four straight regular-season games against Kansas City. But the Chiefs are 3-0 against the Bills in the playoffs with Mahomes, including a road win in the divisional round last January.",
      "That\u2019s why Allen and coach Sean McDermott downplayed the victory.",
      "\u201cIt means we got to nine wins,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI know from outside perception it\u2019s a really big game and what it means for both fan bases and the league, but it\u2019s Week 11.\u201d",

      "But go back to Oct. 4, 2009. McIlroy tied for second in the Dunhill Links Championship and moved to No. 19 in the world at age 20. He has not been outside the top 20 ever since, an astonishing streak of 15 years and counting.",
      "Phil Mickelson at 16 years and 30 weeks is the only player to have a longer run in the top 20.",
      "Even so, the only streak that matters when the conversation turns to McIlroy is his 10 straight years without a major. That's what gives him pause when he rates his year. He was three holes away from a U.S. Open title at Pinehurst No. 2 until he missed short par putts on the 16th and 18th holes, and Bryson DeChambeau saved par with an exquisite bunker shot to beat him.",
      "McIlroy has been desperate to win the Masters for the career Grand Slam. At this point, any major would do. Who could have imagined his last major would have come at age 25?",
      "There also was disappointment on losing a late lead to a fast-charging Rasmus Hojgaard in the Irish Open at Royal County Down, right when all of Northern Ireland was ready to celebrate McIlroy winning on home soil.",
      "Billy Horschel beat him in a playoff at Wentworth. McIlroy's dynamic charge in Paris drowned with a wedge into the water at the Olympics. Play long enough at that level and those outcomes are bound to happen.",
      "A great year? For anyone else, sure.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately for Rory, I think everybody looks at the glass half-empty,\u201d Lowry said. \"I look at it glass half-full. He's had an amazingly consistent year. I've had a consistent year, but he's had consistent top-3 finishes \u2014 mine are top 15s.",
      "\u201cHe probably should have won the U.S. Open \u2014 let's be honest, and he'd say that himself \u2014 but he didn't,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI think he is more determined than ever to come out firing next year, and obviously the Masters will be on the forefront.\u201d",
      "It was more than DeChambeau pipping him at Pinehurst that gave McIlroy pause. He won four times and actually dropped one spot in the world ranking to No. 3, behind Scottie Scheffler and Xander Schauffele.",
      "Scheffler has no equal at the moment with eight wins, including the Masters, The Players Championship and Olympic gold. Schauffele won two majors at the PGA Championship and British Open.",
      "\u201cThey certainly separated themselves from the pack this year,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI'm obviously aware of that, and it only makes me more motivated to try to emulate what they did this year.\u201d",
      "McIlroy said he got choked up at the end of his season at the mention of tying the late Seve Ballesteros with a sixth Order of Merit. Ballesteros is the soul of European golf, and that's not likely to change no matter how many more titles McIlroy wins.",
      "But there was more to the emotion. The end of any season tends to bring that out, and this was a season like no other.",
      "Off the course, McIlroy has been involved in negotiations between the PGA Tour and the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and his desire to reunite with LIV defectors occasionally has put him at odds with other players.",
      "Far more personal was the shock announcement in May he had filed for divorce, and then disclosing a month later they had scrapped the divorce filing in a bid to save their marriage. His wife, Erica, and 4-year-old daughter Poppy celebrated with him in Dubai. Call it five wins for the year.",
      "He played 27 times, a lot early in search of the right formula to be ready for the Masters, and a lot late because the European tour means a lot to him. He says he will scale back. He is not getting any younger. He is no less entertaining.",
      "In light of it all, golf is a game. But that wedge was big. Winning was important. For such a tumultuous year, it was the ideal way for it to end.",
      "\u201cYeah, it's been quite the year,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cBut you know, I'm super happy with where I am in my career and in my life. And I feel like everything\u2019s worked out the way it was supposed to.\u201d",

      "Rafael Nadal has lost 6-4, 6-4 to Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands in the Davis Cup quarterfinals in what could be the last match of the 22-time Grand Slam champion's career",
      "MALAGA, Spain -- MALAGA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Rafael Nadal bit his lower lip and his eyes scanned the stands as he stood alongside his Davis Cup teammates for Spain's national anthem Tuesday before what he \u2014 and everyone \u2014 knew might be the last match of his career, a 6-4, 6-4 loss to Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands.",
      "There were no tears streaming down Nadal\u2019s cheeks, no outward sign of what this moment meant to the 22-time Grand Slam champion, even amid the roars of a sign- and flag-toting crowd, mostly here for one player and one player only. Nadal said beforehand that the emotions would need to wait, that this week was about attempting to claim one last title for his country, not about his impending retirement.",
      "The 38-year-old Spaniard announced last month this event would be it for him as a professional tennis player after two years of injuries that limited him to competing only sparingly, but no one could be sure if that end would arrive in Tuesday\u2019s quarterfinals or later in the Davis Cup Final 8, which wraps up Sunday.",
      "Nadal\u2019s defeat in the opening contest was only the start of the best-of-three Spain vs. Netherlands matchup on an indoor hard court at the sold-out Palacio de Deportes Jose Maria Martin Carpena in southern Spain. It was to be followed by No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz against No. 40 Tallon Griekspoor later Tuesday, and doubles, too, if the teams were tied 1-all after singles.",
      "So it was up to Nadal's countrymen to extend his career. If Spain managed to advance to the semifinals, Nadal's playing days could continue. If the Netherlands were to win, he would be finished.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that it might be the last match that Nadal plays,\u201d Dutch captain Paul Haarhuis said beforehand, \u201cand we hope to give him a nice \u2018Adios.\u2019\u201d",
      "When it ended, with Nadal ranging to his left but not quite able to get into proper position and putting a forehand into the net, he walked to the net for a quick hug with his opponent.",
      "In certain ways, this was, unmistakably, the Nadal everyone remembers. The white headband, marked with the red bull logo he made famous. The white tape wrapped around all four of his left, racket-holding fingers. The water bottles by his sideline bench, placed just so.",
      "There was the occasional ace right on a line. The occasional serve-and-volley foray forward. The occasional over-the-shoulder putaway. And, yes, the occasional hop and uppercut and scream of \u201cVamos!\u201d after claiming a key point or closing out a game.",
      "There also were, neither to Nadal\u2019s or most of the 9,200 spectators\u2019 liking, several points where he did look like what he truly is right now: a once-dominant figure diminished by age and injuries. His forehand didn\u2019t always have the same verve, and his total of 10 groundstroke winners was barely half of van de Zandschulp\u2019s 19. His footwork and speed were hardly what they once were, no matter how many chants of \u201cRa-fa!\u201d or \u201cEspa\u00f1a!\u201d broke out in a bid to spur him.",
      "This result ended Nadal\u2019s 29-match winning streak in Davis Cup singles; the only other blemish on his record, which stood at 29-1 entering Tuesday, came in his debut all the way back in 2004.",
      "But this version of Nadal had hip issues, including surgery in June 2023, and abdominal problems that combined to limit him to only 23 matches over the past two years. He was 12-7 in singles in 2024 before Tuesday.",
      "Indeed, the match against van de Zandschulp \u2014 who upset Alcaraz at the U.S. Open \u2014 was Nadal\u2019s first outing that counted since early August at the Paris Olympics. He lost there in the second round of singles to Novak Djokovic and bowed out in the doubles quarterfinals alongside Alcaraz.",
      "Nadal and Alcaraz \u2014 at 21, a four-time major champion considered his heir apparent \u2014 practiced with each other hours before the start of play. The run-up to this Davis Cup has largely been about memories of, and tributes to, Nadal \u2014 including a lengthy post on social media by his rival and friend Roger Federer.",
      "Nadal will forever be remembered for his rivalries with Federer and Djokovic as part of the Big Three of men\u2019s tennis, a trio of generational talents who ruled the sport for much of the past two decades.",
      "Federer, now 43, announced his departure in 2022; only Djokovic, 37, remains active.",
      "All three were talented. All three were successful. All three were popular.",
      "Nadal\u2019s appeal with fans was in the way he played and the humble way he conducted himself away from a court, which might explain why there were fans wearing the orange representing Netherlands who applauded for him when he was introduced. Or why there were spectators from countries other than Spain who toted their nations\u2019 flags bearing messages supporting him.",
      "The locals expressed their love over and over, from the raucous standing ovation that greeted his entrance to the court. During pre-match player introductions, as Nadal\u2019s many accomplishments were read over the speaker system, there were yells that greeted the listing of each of the 14 years he won the French Open on its red clay and each of the five times he helped Spain claim the Davis Cup.",
      "In an example of the sort of home-court advantage frequently seen at this team event \u2014 more soccer rowdiness than stereotypical tennis genteelness \u2014 they jeered and whistled whenever the contingent of Netherlands fans in a small section of the lower bowl tried to offer encouragement to their guy.",
      "During play, Nadal's backers shouted \u201cSi, se puede!\u201d (\u201cYes, you can!\u201d) to try to encourage him. Nadal, simply, could not.",

      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers, writes AP reviewer Rob Merrill about Myers\u2019 memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow.\u201d",
      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers. From a decade doing everything for ESPN (SportsCenter, play by play, and succeeding Roy Firestone as host of the interview show \u201cUp Close\u201d) to decades of involvement with nearly every league under contract with Fox Sports (NFL, NASCAR, Major League Baseball), the kid from Miami has truly seen and done it all when it comes to sports television.",
      "Which is why it\u2019s a little surprising that his memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow,\u201d isn\u2019t more revealing. It hits all the admittedly very high points \u2014 the first live interview with O.J. Simpson following the civil judgement against him in the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders, the 1989 California earthquake that postponed the World Series for a week, and live on-the-scene reporting from the Centennial Park bombing at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 \u2014 but a lot of it is pulled from transcripts and comes across as a rather dry retelling of what fans will recall seeing on TV.",
      "For readers looking to get into the business, though, there\u2019s some good advice in these pages. Myers knew early on what he wanted to do with his life and began writing down his goals. \u201cGet on the radio. Be an anchor on TV,\u201d he scrawled in lipstick on his mirror as a kid. As he grew, he swapped the mirror for note cards and kept them close to his bed, reading them often as reminders. And as he climbed to a top rung on the TV sports ladder, he followed this adage: \u201cIf you don\u2019t jump at unexpected opportunities, you won\u2019t get more than what\u2019s expected.\u201d That\u2019s the tenet that convinced him to leave ESPN for Fox Sports, which was essentially a network start-up in 1998.",
      "That decision led to a slew of opportunities that brought Myers face-to-face with a galaxy of sports stars. He recalls some of his most memorable on-camera moments, from Tom Brady after winning Super Bowls to Mike Tyson in his heyday to the Boise State player who proposed to his cheerleader girlfriend live on Fox. Unlike many TV sportscasters, Myers never got pigeonholed into a sport, which explains how he became the voice of NASCAR as stock car racing surged in popularity.",
      "Being on TV does have its perks, and Myers\u2019 personal friendships with Bill Murray and Charles Barkley fall into that category. Some of the best chapters recount escapades with each of them, one involving a corned beef sandwich and another Barkley\u2019s prodigious gambling habit. There\u2019s also some real heart here, as most fans will probably have forgotten the personal loss Myers experienced in 2012 when his 19-year-old son Christopher died in a car accident.",
      "\u201cBack then I thought, \u2018Well, there\u2019ll be other days.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize that that was the only day,\u201d is a line spoken by actor Burt Lancaster as Archie \u201cMoonlight\u201d Graham in the movie \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and Myers uses it to reflect on how it felt (and still feels) to lose a son. The supportive role played by Rick Hendrick, the legendary owner of Hendrick Motorsports, during that tumultuous time in Myers\u2019 life, is a touching revelation.",
      "In the end, it\u2019s easy to forgive Myers for not dishing more or burning any bridges in his memoir. He admits he\u2019s lived his dream and perhaps the ultimate lesson readers should take from the book is that, sometimes, nice guys do finish first.",

      "The game was tied at 95 with 8:46 left, but LaVine had nine points in a 13-2 run that put the Bulls up by 11 with 5:45 to go. He hit six 3-pointers in the quarter after a slow start.",

    "title": "New era of college football could help other teams replicate Indiana's remarkable rise",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 14:42:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade",
    "story": [
      "Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade",
      "Indiana has made the type of turnaround that had only happened once before at the power-conference level over the last decade.",
      "But this new era of college football with unbalanced schedules and loosened transfer restrictions might make such dramatic transformations more common.",
      "\u201cI think any P4 school with the proper commitment is capable of being successful and being ultimately successful because really the difference between victory and defeat in most of these games is very slight, slim,\u201d Indiana coach Curt Cignetti said. \u201cIt\u2019s all attainable.\u201d",
      "Cignetti just agreed to terms on an eight-year contract as No. 5 Indiana prepares for arguably the biggest game in program history, a showdown Saturday at No. 2 Ohio State. Cignetti\u2019s new deal gives him an annual salary of $8 million plus a $1 million annual retention bonus.",
      "He earned that raise when Indiana won its first 10 games this season after going 3-9 the year before his arrival.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done is utterly amazing,\u201d said Jimbo Fisher, the former Florida State and Texas A&M coach who now hosts a show on SiriusXM Radio. \u201cI think it\u2019s the best job in college football right now. I think he\u2019s national coach of the year.\u201d",
      "If the pandemic-shortened 2020 season is taken out of consideration, Indiana is the 21st team since 1973 to win at least 10 games immediately after a season in which it had three wins or fewer, according to Sportradar.",
      "Indiana is the first Power Four team to accomplish this since Michigan State went 10-3 in 2017 after going 3-9 in 2016. The last Power Four program to do it before Michigan State was Auburn, which was 3-9 in 2012 but went 12-1 and reached the BCS championship game in 2013.",
      "Indiana\u2019s emergence has come in a season featuring many other dramatic rises and falls, whether it\u2019s Vanderbilt going from 2-10 in 2023 to beating Alabama and becoming bowl eligible this year, or Florida State winning just one game thus far after posting an undefeated regular-season record a year ago.",
      "That lends credence to the notion that the loosening of transfer restrictions and the emergence of unbalanced schedules in super-sized conferences could enable other programs to replicate Indiana\u2019s rapid rebuild.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s more conducive to happening, yes,\u201d Fisher said.",
      "Now that players don\u2019t have to sit out a season after switching schools \u2014 resulting in exponentially more transfers \u2014 teams can reshape their rosters every year. Indiana opened the season with 27 transfer newcomers and had just 36 returning scholarship players.",
      "The only Football Bowl Subdivision teams with fewer returning scholarship players were North Texas and Colorado, with 31 each.",
      "\u201cThey just did a really good job of bringing in the right guys, bringing in the right people,\u201d said Michigan coach Sherrone Moore, whose team lost at Indiana 20-15 on Nov. 9.",
      "The fortunes of teams from year to year also can change depending on their conference schedules. The Big Ten has 18 teams playing nine conference games and the Southeastern Conference has 16 teams with an eight-game conference schedule. That means some teams will have much tougher or easier schedules than their conference foes.",
      "Only one of the 10 teams Indiana has beaten owns a winning record: Washington (6-5).",
      "\u201cI do think it will be that way because there are chances you\u2019re going to have years where you get to roll through a schedule that might not be the trickiest,\u201d said Dan Mullen, a former Florida and Mississippi State coach now working as an analyst for ESPN.",
      "Mullen also noted that sometimes you don\u2019t know how favorable a schedule might be until the end of the season. For instance, Indiana played Michigan and Washington, the two participants in last year\u2019s College Football Playoff championship game. Both are struggling to finish above .500 this year.",
      "While the transfer portal and the unbalanced schedules could make it easier for teams to rebuild on the fly, Indiana\u2019s rise included some unique elements. After Cignetti left James Madison for Indiana, 13 players from his former school joined him.",
      "Those former James Madison players already were familiar with Cignetti\u2019s approach and assisted Indiana\u2019s holdovers in adapting to it. That made for an easier transition than if all of Indiana\u2019s transfers had come from a variety of other programs.",
      "\u201cThat whole JMU crew that came over really facilitated the culture change here, and they\u2019re all major contributors for the most part,\u201d Cignetti said. \u201cBetween the white lines and on defense you\u2019ve got some real key guys playing at a high level. I think that familiarity with the program, the defense, the offense, the special teams has been extremely beneficial.\u201d",
      "Big Ten Network analyst Gerry DiNardo wonders if Indiana\u2019s success might cause another Power Four program making a coaching change to try something similar by hiring a successful Group of Five coach who could bring along players from his former school.",
      "\u201cThat is a new model,\u201d DiNardo said. \u201cAnd that new model obviously is working, and that new model obviously could work again.\u201d",
      "The help Indiana got from the transfer portal and its favorable schedule shouldn\u2019t diminish what the Hoosiers have accomplished. Revitalizing a program remains challenging even in this era. Just ask Nebraska and Wisconsin, two of Indiana\u2019s Big Ten rivals.",
      "Both programs have much greater football traditions than Indiana, which had never won as many as 10 games in a season before this year. Nebraska\u2019s Matt Rhule and Wisconsin\u2019s Luke Fickell \u2014 both in their second years \u2014 had higher profiles than Cignetti had upon his arrival at Indiana. Yet the Cornhuskers and Badgers are at .500 heading into their Saturday matchup and recently made offensive coordinator changes.",
      "DiNardo understands the enormity of Indiana\u2019s accomplishment better than most. He posted an 8-27 record as Indiana\u2019s coach from 2002-04 and knows the challenges of winning there. He credits athletic director Scott Dolson for bucking the trend of hiring an up-and-coming offensive coordinator and instead choosing the 63-year-old Cignetti, who had a proven record of head coaching success at smaller programs.",
      "\u201cScott Dolson, he deserves a lot of credit for this decision,\u201d DiNardo said last week, before Cignetti got his new deal. \u201cAnd I think he will continue to support the football coach at a high level, more than previous athletic directors have. It\u2019s not just a one-year deal for Scott. He will give the football coach what he needs to be successful. That wasn\u2019t always true. It was always true that the AD would give the basketball coach what they need to be successful. I think Scott will do both.\u201d",

    "summary": "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
    "story": [
      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire company is working to develop a fleet of autonomous helicopters that it hopes can be used to put out fires, spray crops and handle other dangerous jobs",
      "HENNIKER, N.H. -- When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few \u201cnasty experiences\u201d while trying to navigate at night.",
      "The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters.",
      "Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires.",
      "For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers.",
      "On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas.",
      "\u201cPeople would call us up and say, \u2018hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?\u2019 We\u2019d say, OK maybe,\u201d Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing.",
      "Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors.",
      "At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night.",
      "One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety.",
      "Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents.",
      "A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities.",
      "\u201cIt is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,\u201d said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. \u201cThey make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.\u201d",
      "Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals.",
      "In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone.",
      "\u201cIt's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,\u201d Martin said.",
      "But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka.",
      "California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agr\u00edcola.",
      "Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming \u201crevolution,\" that will save farmers money and improve safety.",
      "The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs.",
      "\u201cThe biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,\u201d Koch said. \u201cThere\u2019s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you\u2019ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.\u201d",
      "But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace \u2014 though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people.",
      "\u201cPutting more systems into the air that don\u2019t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,\" he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong \u2014 its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control.",
      "If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. \u201cThat means that we\u2019ll never have an aircraft fly away event,\" he said.",
      "The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment.",
      "\u201cI think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles.\""

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which dominates market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom.",
      "But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work.",
      "That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI.",
      "\u201cThese companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,\u201d said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThe broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.\u201d",
      "It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining \u2014 the \u201cP\u201d in ChatGPT \u2014 that involves AI systems \u201clearning\u201d from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other.",
      "However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work \u2014 such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response.",
      "GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.",
      "\u201cWith training, you\u2019re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that\u2019s a lighter weight,\u201d said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen.",
      "That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals \u2014 such as AMD and Intel \u2014 to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware.",
      "D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 \u2014 a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia.",
      "\u201cThere were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was \u2018you\u2019re too late,\u2019\u201d he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work.",
      "Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school.",
      "\u201cWe spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That\u2019s training, right?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge \u2014 and then you get rewarded for being efficient.\u201d",
      "The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company \u2014 the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips \u2014 and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool.",
      "The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months \u2014 if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan.",
      "D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door.",
      "While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele.",
      "Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation.",
      "\u201cThe dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cBuying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.\u201d",
      "Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response.",
      "He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones.",
      "Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else.",
      "Sheth says the big concern right now is, \u201care we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI \u2014 human-like intelligence?\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence \u2014 predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest.",
      "\u201cBut then what about the rest?\u201d he said. \u201cThey cannot be put on the same path.\u201d",
      "The other set of companies don\u2019t want to use very large AI models \u2014 it\u2019s too costly and uses too much energy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don\u2019t think they appreciate that. It\u2019s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,\u201d Sheth said.",

      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",

      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump headed to Brownsville, Texas, on Tuesday to watch one of Elon Musk \u2019s companies test its Starship rocket, the latest sign of a deepening bond between the president-elect and the world's richest man.",
      "Ever since Musk began camping out at Mar-a-Lago after the election, there's been speculation over when Trump would grow tired of having him hanging around and giving him advice on running the country.",
      "But Tuesday's outing was a remarkable display of intimacy between the two, one with implications for American politics, the U.S. government, foreign policy and even the possibility of humans reaching Mars.",
      "\u201cGood luck to Elon Musk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media website, while en route to Texas.",
      "Musk spent around $200 million to help Trump beat Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race, and he's been given unparalleled access. He's counseled Trump on nominees for the new administration, joined the president-elect's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and been tapped to co-chair an advisory panel on cutting the size of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "In addition to political influence, Musk could benefit personally as well. SpaceX, his rocket company, has billions of dollars in government contracts and the goal of eventually starting a colony on Mars. He's also CEO of Tesla, which manufactures electric vehicles, and has battled with regulators over safety concerns involving autonomous driving.",
      "\u201cTrump has the biggest possible regard for people who break the rules and get away with it,\" said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \"Musk has demonstrated extraordinary accomplishment in doing that.\u201d",
      "To top if off, Musk owns the social media company X, formally known as Twitter, which he has harnessed as an influential perch to promote Trump and his agenda.",
      "\u201cStop the Swamp!\u201d he wrote on Tuesday as he shared a warning that entrenched Washington interests are trying to undermine Trump before his inauguration.",
      "Before the election, Musk rejected the idea that he was expecting any favors in return for supporting Trump in the presidential race.",
      "\u201cThere is no quid pro quo,\u201d he posted on X in September. \u201cWith a Trump administration, we can execute major government reform, remove bureaucratic paperwork that is smothering the country and unlock a new age of prosperity.\u201d",
      "However, Trump has not gone anywhere without Musk in the two weeks since beating Harris. Musk joined Trump at a meeting with House Republicans in Washington and sat next to him at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York. The trip to Texas for the rocket launch will be Trump's third time outside Florida since the election.",
      "Much of Trump's activity is happening with little public access for the press. Unlike his predecessors, he has opted against regularly making his travel plans or events open to journalists.",
      "The relationship between Trump and Musk was not always so close.",
      "Two years ago, Trump was mocking Musk in stump speeches and Musk was saying it was time for Trump to \u201chang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America,\u201d Musk wrote on social media.",
      "But Musk swiftly endorsed Trump after the former president survived an assassination attempt in July. He quickly became a central figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, appearing at times more like his running mate than Ohio Sen. JD Vance.",
      "Trump started boasting about Musk's accomplishments at campaign rallies, such as when Starship's reusable rocket booster returned to the launch tower and was caught by mechanical arms.",
      "\u201cThose arms grab it like you grab your baby, just like you grab your little baby. And it hugged it and just put it down, and there it was,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Musk was with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort on election night and has spent much of the two weeks since there. Trump\u2019s granddaughter Kai Trump posted a photo of her with Musk at one of Trump\u2019s golf resorts, writing that Musk was \"achieving uncle status.\u201d",
      "Last week, Musk appeared in a golden ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, seated in the center of the room as a guest of honor at an event. Trump, in his remarks at the black tie event, said Musk\u2019s IQ is \u201cabout as high as they can get\u201d and praised him as \u201ca really good guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe launched a rocket three weeks ago and then he went to Pennsylvania to campaign because he considered this more important than launching rockets that cost billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He joked about Musk\u2019s constant presence at Mar-a-Lago, saying, \u201cHe likes this place. I can\u2019t get him out of here.\"",
      "He added, \u201cAnd you know what, I like having him here.\u201d",
      "Musk was so heralded by Trump\u2019s crowd that he was invited to speak on stage at the event after Trump, in which he spoke of the president-elect\u2019s victory like he was his running mate.",

      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",

      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",

      "Disgruntled X users are once again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

      "A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 has been sentenced to five years in prison",
      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not an evil person,\u201d Enzer said. \u201cThis is a good person who made some very bad mistakes.\u201d",

      "It's auction time for Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee had said sealed bids would be opened at 10:30 a.m. CST so the winning bidder or bidders could be chosen. But Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the results.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "He later wrote on the social media platform X that the trustees told him the results will be released Thursday morning.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",

      "The Walt Disney Co. said Thursday that its direct-to-consumer business, which includes Disney+ and Hulu, reported quarterly operating income of $253 million compared with an operating loss of $420 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15% to $5.78 billion.",

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "Trump's lawyers laid out their new argument to dismiss the case in a filing made public Tuesday, writing that the case must be dismissed because a sitting president is immune from prosecution.",
      "\"To require President Trump to address further criminal proceedings at this point would not only violate the federal Constitution, but also disrupt the Presidential transition process,\" wrote defense lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, both of whom Trump nominated last week to top DOJ posts in his new administration.",
      "Prosecutors pushed back on that claim, arguing that presidential immunity would not apply to a defendant who had already been convicted for conduct that is entirely private.",

      "Senate Democrats are expected to work to confirm Biden's nominees.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday called for a halt in confirming President Joe Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary until he takes office, accusing Democrats of \"trying to stack the courts.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, urging Republican senators to \"show up and hold the line.\"",
      "\"No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The directive from the president-elect comes as Senate Democrats are expected to dedicate hours of floor time in the coming weeks as part of a last-minute effort to confirm as many of Biden's nominees before Trump takes over in January. Senate Republicans thwarted their efforts late Monday night, a plan from their soon-to-be leader Sen. John Thune and a reversal from his previous stance on blocking confirmations of qualified judicial nominees.",
      "Senate Republicans rebelled late Monday night, dragging out the floor process by forcing Democrats to hold time-consuming votes on procedural motions that are usually routine and otherwise mundane. Actions that should have taken minutes on the floor instead took hours.",
      "Thune, who takes over as Republican leader of the Senate in January, took credit for the rebellion saying in a statement that Republicans would not \"roll over\" to appoint Biden's nominees to the federal bench in the \"final weeks of the Democrat majority.\"",
      "\"If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,\" Thune said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "Thune's statement vowing to obstruct the judicial confirmation process in the final hours of the Biden presidency is a departure from comments he made just a few years ago toward the end of Trump's administration. At the time, Thune touted the importance of confirming judges to the bench, saying it was \"one of our most important responsibilities as senators\" and one of the main reasons he ran for the Senate.",
      "\"Mr. President, confirming good judges is one of our most important responsibilities as senators. And it's a responsibility I take very seriously,\" Thune said during a floor speech on Nov. 18 2020 -- after Biden won the election.",
      "\"After George W. Bush's election, Democrats decided that the president's judicial nominees might not deliver the results Democrats wanted. And so, they decided to adopt a new strategy -- blocking judicial nominees on a regular basis,\" Thune said during his remarks in 2020. \"I was one of the many Americans upset by the blockade of talented, well-qualified nominees. And it was one of the main reasons I ran for the Senate. I promised South Dakotans that if they elected me, I would help put outstanding judges on the bench.\"",
      "\"In fact, one of the main reasons I was first elected to the Senate was to make sure outstanding judicial nominees were confirmed to the federal bench. It's hard to imagine now, but confirming judges used to be a pretty bipartisan affair,\" Thune said at the time.",
      "His comments from 2020 are a notable reversal from his comments this week, as Senate Republicans look to obstruct Democrats as they attempt to do the same for Biden.",
      "Schumer though, doubled down on his efforts Tuesday, and said he expects the Senate to work late into the night again this Wednesday to get the nominees through. Senate Democrats are hoping to confirm as many judges to lifetime appointments as they can while Biden is still president.",
      "\"Members should be prepared for another late night on Wednesday to vote on the nominations I filed last night,\" Schumer warned.",
      "\"Voting on the president's judicial nominees is a core function of the Senate. It's one of our basic responsibilities, and we're going to carry out that responsibility as long as this majority continues. I'm very proud of the judges we've confirmed over the past four years under this administration, they have all been highly qualified individuals, and together, they represent a wide range of experiences and areas of expertise.\"",
      "Schumer touted the quality of judges the Senate has passed under his leadership, noting their many backgrounds and cultures and identities. He said under his watch, the Senate has confirmed a record number of women and people of color to the federal bench.",
      "Republicans have Democrats' record on judicial confirmations beat.",
      "Republicans confirmed 234 of Trump's nominees to the federal courts during his four years in office, and so far the Democrat-controlled Senate has confirmed 216 under Biden's administration.",
      "\"We're not done,\" Schumer said on the floor Tuesday. \"There are more judges to consider and confirm.\"",
      "Schumer vowed to spend the rest of the week -- and the year -- confirming more judges. Every judge confirmed in this lame-duck session of Congress is one fewer vacancy Trump can fill come January.",

      "The United States has seen a significant increase in the use of clean energy over the last few years; however, Chris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of energy, has claimed otherwise.",
      "Wright, chief executive of Liberty Energy -- the world\u2019s second-largest fracking services company -- has made several comments chastising efforts to fight climate change. One example is a video he posted to LinkedIn last year in which he denies the existence of a climate crisis and disputes a global transition to green energy.",
      "\"There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either,\" Wright said.",
      "Wright has been an outspoken critic of policies aimed at curbing climate change, including the Department of Energy's goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",
      "While Wright does not dispute the existence of climate change, he has argued that policies aimed at reducing the impact of climate change are misguided and alarmist, claiming that any negative impacts of climate change are \"clearly overwhelmed by the benefits of increasing energy consumption.\"",
      "But the IPCC, the world\u2019s most authoritative body on climate change, has stated that human-amplified climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe, and this has led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.",

      "\"The U.S. is definitely in an energy transition, as is the rest of the globe,\" Lori Bird, U.S. energy program director at the World Resource Institute, told ABC News.",
      "Coal is one of the industries in which the energy transition is most apparent, Bird said.",
      "Coal plants are seeing an average of 10,000 megawatts of capacity closures per year, according to the Institute for the Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Installed U.S. coal-fired generation capacity peaked in 2011 at 317,600 megawatts and has experienced a consistent downward trend ever since, the analysis found. In 2020, during the pandemic, coal\u2019s share of power generation in the U.S. fell below 20% for the first time. In 2024 so far, coal's share of power generation barely topped 16%.",
      "\"Based on current announcements and IEEFA research, we expect operating coal capacity to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade,\" the report states.",
      "Accompanying the sharp decrease in coal generation and usage has been the increase in capacity and storage for electricity generation from solar, wind and battery power, Bird said.",
      "A record 31 gigawatts of solar energy capacity was installed in the U.S. in 2023 -- roughly a 55% increase from 2022, according to a report by the World Resource Institute that found that clean energy continues to be the dominant form of new electricity generation in the U.S.",
      "\"Everywhere you look, in every facet of the economy, there are clean technologies ramping up and being brought to bear,\" Julie McNamara, senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ABC News.",
      "In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act stimulated an \"unprecedented\" slate for the creation of domestic clean energy manufacturing facilities, the report found. Since August 2022, 113 manufacturing facilities or expansions, totaling $421 billion in investments, have been announced, according to American Clean Power.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that came before it includes tax credits for both the home and commercial installation of charging stations for electric vehicles, evidence in the growing market share for EVs, which reached 10% in U.S. automotive sales in the third quarter of 2024, Bird said.",
      "But the federal government isn't the ultimate decider of the energy transition in the U.S., Bird said. While there could be a slowdown in progress during the next administration, the energy transition will continue to be driven by other stakeholders \"who want this to happen,\" she said.",
      "\"It would be impossible to halt the energy transition at this stage,\" Bird said.",
      "States in the U.S. are also continuing to pass ambitious climate and energy policies, a trend experts expect to continue despite who is living in the White House. State actions are considered critical to ensuring a successful clean energy transition, as federal actions alone are insufficient, according to the WRI. There are 29 states that have renewable electricity standards or clean energy standards in place, and a third of U.S. states have have standards to shift to 100% clean electricity, Bird said.",
      "At the beginning of 2023, Minnesota adopted a 100% clean energy standard, while Michigan did the same later that year, joining states like California and New York in passing permitting reforms intended to make it easier to build clean energy and transmission.",
      "\"While the federal leadership may slow some of this transition, it's being driven by states,\" Bird said.",
      "Another critical piece of the energy transition is tech companies, which are very large users of energy. committing to using sustainable energy to power their data centers, Bird said. One example is Microsoft paying to restart one of the nuclear reactors at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania to power the company's AI data center.",
      "\"Those companies that are driving a lot of this want clean energy,\" Bird said. \"That's not going to go away. They're committed.\"",
      "Throughout the 2024 election, Republicans stuck to party lines when it comes to rhetoric about the fossil fuel industry, which invests heavily into GOP politicians and candidates, David Konisky, a professor of environmental politics at Indiana University's O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, told ABC News in August. The rhetoric often includes misrepresentations on clean energy solutions rather than all-out climate denial, experts told ABC News.",
      "The fossil fuel industry, through its lobbying in government, has attempted to slow any efforts at the energy transition, McNamara said.",
      "\"The only reason to say there's no energy transition underway is to attempt to solidify policies and incentives that that anchor short-term profits for fossil fuel interests,\" McNamara said.",
      "Misinformation and disinformation about the climate crisis is \"not helpful to the situation,\" especially given that people all over the world are already experiencing the impacts of a warming climate in the form of extreme weather events, Bird said, adding that bipartisan support will be crucial going forward.",
      "\"We're hopeful that with the new administration, that additional progress could be made,\" Bird said.",

    "title": "Can he do that? How Trump could try to break the federal government",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 14:27:49 -0500",
    "summary": "A look at how Trump can upend the federal government, including \"deleting\" agencies and ousting workers he sees as unloyal.",
    "story": [
      "With more Trump-appointed judges in the courts, legal challenges could fail.",
      "President Donald Trump's picks to lead the next administration are talking about abolishing entire agencies and firing tens of thousands of federal workers at a time.",
      "But can he and they actually do all that?",
      "Experts believe Trump can get much further on upending the government system this go-around compared to his first term -- in part because the typical checks and balances are expected to lean in his favor.",
      "Next year, the House and Senate are on track to fall under Republican control. Trump also got 226 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices confirmed while he was in office last time -- giving his ideas a sympathetic ear in the courts when he gets sued.",
      "With that in mind, here's a look at how Trump could try to \"break\" the federal government:",
      "Elon Musk, who Trump has picked to co-lead the new outside-of-government \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" has said he wants to cut $2 trillion of the $7 trillion in annual federal spending. His partner, Vivek Ramaswamy, told Fox News that they would achieve this through \"mass reductions\" and that some governmental agencies may be \"deleted outright.\"",
      "The idea seems far-fetched at first because federal agencies are established by federal law. The Department of Education, for example, was created by a 1979 passed by Congress signed by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "Congress would need to pass new legislation to erase or significantly reform the Education Department -- an uphill battle even with a Republican-led Congress.",
      "Enter the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. For much of the country's existence, presidents could, in theory, ignore spending money appropriated by Congress.",
      "President Richard Nixon used the tactic of sitting on -- or impounding -- federal money -- essentially leaving funds untouched in U.S. Treasury accounts -- when he thought the spending was wasteful.",
      "Democrats responded in 1974 by passing a law that requires a president to spend federal money the way Congress intended.",
      "In a campaign video posted last year, Trump said he would challenge the Impoundment Control Act. It's possible too that he could deem the law unconstitutional and try to ignore it -- inviting legal challenges that could take years to resolve.",
      "\"For 200 years under our system of government, it was undisputed that the president had the constitutional power to stop unnecessary spending through what is known as impoundment,\" Trump said in a video during the GOP primaries.",
      "He later added: \"When I returned to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court, and, if necessary, get Congress to overturn it.\"",
      "Among the ideas Trump is expected to try again this term is to make the lives of federal workers uncomfortable or to relocate their jobs to remote locations.",
      "In his first administration, Trump temporarily decimated the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management by relocating its Washington headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado. The idea, officials said at the time, was to put leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage. But the vast majority of the workers quit and the office never was able to find employees to replace them.",
      "Another tactic could be to make it harder for workers to file grievances or strip them of legal protections.",
      "In fall of 2020, during the final months of Trump's first administration, he issued an executive order that would have created a new class of employees handling policy-related duties, essentially stripping them from legal protections that kept them in their jobs.",
      "The idea of Schedule F came too late in Trump's first administration to have a significant impact, but it's one expected to be pushed early on this time.",
      "The tactic is risky to taxpayers in the long term. While lawsuits and complaints by federal workers could take years to resolve, the federal government could owe back pay to workers who can prove they were wrongfully terminated.",
      "\"Taking a hatchet to this stuff will have an impact today and for decades to come,\" said Andrew Huddleston, communications director of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees that opposed Trump's election.",
      "\"It will be the future generations that pay the price,\" he said.",
      "In order to remake the government, Trump will need to install loyal allies across senior levels of the government and find ways to slow down legal challenges.",
      "Among his proposals is to outsource FBI background checks for appointees to private investigators, a tactic that would enable him to hire people close to him even if there are security flags.",
      "Trump also has called for the use of \"recess appointments\" in the Senate, a common move by past presidents. For Trump though, it could enable his allies to ram through nominations without FBI security checks or financial disclosures so long as the chamber is adjourned for 10 days or longer. Sen. John Thune, the GOP's pick as majority leader, said he hasn't ruled out the idea, even though it would mean ceding the Senate's \"advise and consent\" constitutional confirmation power to the president.",
      "Another Trump tactic for forcing change could be developing his biggest plans in secret, making it harder for opponents to object and mount legal challenges.",
      "Ramaswamy said the new 'Department of Government Efficiency', or DOGE, will operate outside of government as a kind of private advisory group. That means its staff won't be required to submit financial disclosures or report conflicts of interest.",
      "It won't be clear who is doing work for DOGE or how decisions are made. And while Musk has said he wants staff to work for free, it's likely industry lobbyists would eagerly sign up if it means being able to influence how future taxpayer money is spent.",
      "Musk, who owns the rocket company SpaceX, has blamed federal regulations slowing his quest to reach Mars and oversees billions in contracts with the federal government, including military satellites. Ramaswamy founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences and remains a stakeholder who also could benefit financially depending upon how future federal regulations are written.",
      "At last weeks gala hosted by the America First Policy Institute, Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy make the perfect pair to shake up the government.",
      "\"We're going to reduce regulation, waste, fraud, and inefficiency, and these two guys are going to find a lot of it,\" Trump said.",

      "Vought -- who has been seen at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in recent days meeting with Trump's top advisers -- served in Trump's first administration as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and has been in active discussions to return to the next administration, sources familiar with the matter said.",
      "It's not clear what position Vought could ultimately get, but he's been discussed as a candidate for his previous job or for a top White House post that focuses on economic policy, the sources said.",

      "Gene Hamilton, the author of the Department of Justice chapter, is among those being considered for a top legal role in Trump's administration, according to sources. In his Project 2025 chapter, Hamilton criticizes the DOJ, claiming it has been \"captured by an unaccountable bureaucratic managerial class and radical Left ideologues who have embedded themselves throughout its offices and components.\"",
      "Hamilton calls for a sweeping \"top-to-bottom overhaul\" of the Justice Department, as well as an internal review of \"all major active FBI investigations,\" recommending the termination of any that are deemed unlawful or contrary to national interests.",

      "On Sunday, Trump's team said that Brendan Carr will serve as the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission -- a selection that places one of tech billionaire Elon Musk's active defenders in charge of regulating the nation's airwaves. Carr, who has used his position to defend Musk's companies, authored the chapter of Project 2025 that detailed how he intended to run the agency.",
      "Former ICE Director Tom Homan has been picked to serve as \"border czar\" for the incoming administration, overseeing the mass deportations that have been promised by Trump throughout his 2024 campaign, and immigration hard-liner and top adviser Stephen Miller will serve as Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy. Both Homan and Miller have ties to Project 2025.",
      "Homan is a Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, the Trump-aligned group behind the controversial plan, and is also listed as a contributor to the Project 2025 document.

    "summary": "Amid mounting frustration from centrist voters, one group thinks the solution to making parties and political candidates more palatable: comprehensive election reform.",
    "story": [
      "Voters just rejected election reform ballot initiatives like the one proposed.",
      "Amid mounting frustration from centrist voters and shifting party coalitions, one group thinks it has the solution to making parties and political candidates: comprehensive election reform.",
      "Unite America, a philanthropic venture fund, is in the middle of a yearslong effort to support ballot initiatives that would fundamentally alter the way candidates are elected. Rather than hold party primaries, some of which independent voters can't partake in, states would hold one large primary for all candidates for a race. Then, general election voters would be able to sift through winners in some form, including a ranked choice system or a competition between the top two vote getters.",
      "In an interview with ABC News, Unite America Executive Director Nick Troiano said the system is intended to make the general election the race of consequence rather than low-turnout primaries in safe red or blue areas, making candidates accountable to voters of all stripes.",
      "\"If you're a candidate, the advantage is you're no longer only having to appeal to one side. You can talk to all the voters, and then all the voters can vote for whomever they want,\" Troiano said.",
      "\"It's really about trying to make the general election the election of consequence, meaning the primary, everybody can vote, everybody can run, but it winnows down to just a few candidates in a general election, when most people vote, should really be when the decision is made.\"",
      "The reform movement is ramping up at a time of transformation for both parties. Democrats, smarting from Vice President Kamala Harris' loss, are looking to make a brand more palatable to working-class voters. And Republicans are expected to be tied even closer to President-elect Donald Trump after his win this month.",
      "But the election reform efforts are coming off a rough election cycle.",
      "Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada and South Dakota shot down ballot initiatives that would have instituted all-party primaries rather than contests grouping candidates of one party together. The effort marked a setback given rising conversations around other democracy-related issues like gerrymandering.",
      "Troiano conceded the defeats, noting spending from both parties against the ballot initiatives and insisting that progress is not anticipated to be \"linear.\" Unite America's advisors include those who worked on the marriage equality movement, which saw several states ban the practice in the 2004 election cycle but only to see same-sex marriage become federally legalized in 2015.",
      "\"Sometimes it's two steps forward, one step back. But that's how any movement that has made meaningful change in our country has worked. And so, we're disappointed but not deterred from this mission,\" Troiano said.",
      "Some states already have versions of what Unite America is proposing.",
      "Voters in 2022 implemented all-party primaries followed by ranked-choice general elections. Maine already has ranked choice voting. And other states like California and Louisiana institute so-called jungle primaries, which hold all-party primaries and then send the top two candidates to the general election if no contender hits 50%.",
      "Rising independent voter registrations give Troiano hope that momentum will build for the reforms Unite America is pushing.",
      "In the meantime, the group will conduct more research, link up with interest groups and push more ballot measures, Troiano said.",
      "And, Unite America insists, both parties can benefit.",
      "Democratic strategists have theorized that Harris lost this year's presidential race because of a brand that was viewed as too far to the left -- a reputation that could be confirmed by party primaries fueled by the most liberal voters. And Republicans have ceded ground in the suburbs, historically GOP power bases, with a reputation too firmly tied to Trump.",
      "Democratic senators-elect who scored victories in Trump-won states were able to establish brands detached from that of the national party, and the only two Republican House members who impeached Trump left standing -- California Rep. David Valadao and Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse -- use all party primaries.",
      "\"I think both parties have a medium to long-term advantage in these reforms because it will help them nominate more mainstream candidates,\" Troiano said. \"Both parties have a declining market share of the electorate as independents continue to grow, so it is to their advantage to think about ways to broaden their appeal.\"",

      "Sgt. DeRicko Gaither made the complaint about the tattoo in 2021.",
      "The National Guardsman who in 2021 pegged Pete Hegseth as a potential \"insider threat\" clarified in an interview with ABC News that his complaint targeted\u00a0a \"Deus Vult\" tattoo on the former Fox News host's arm -- not a cross on his chest, as Hegseth has repeatedly claimed.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump last week tapped Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He listed Hegseth's experience as a veteran and his media experience as his reasons for the choice.",
      "As\u00a0Reuters\u00a0and The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0first reported, Sgt. DeRicko Gaither sent an image of the \"Deus Vult\" tattoo to Maj. Gen. William Walker shortly before President Joe Biden's inauguration. The phrase, which translates from Latin to \"God wills it,\" has been co-opted by white nationalist groups, experts have said.",
      "\"This information is quite disturbing, sir,\" Gaither wrote in the email to Walker, who has not responded to ABC News' request for comment. \"This falls along the lines of (an) Insider Threat.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed in his book \"The War on Warriors\" that his \"orders were revoked\" ahead of Biden's inauguration because fellow service members had flagged a tattoo of the Jerusalem Cross on his chest as a white nationalist symbol.\u00a0As a result, Hegseth wrote, he resigned from the military.",
      "But Gaither clarified in a text message to ABC News that his complaint targeted the \"Deus Vult\" tattoo, despite\u00a0\"the narrative that has been out there.\"",
      "\"Just so we are clear. This has NOTHING to do with the Jerusalem Cross tattoo on his chest,\"\u00a0Gaither wrote in the text.\u00a0\"This has everything to do with the 'DEUS VULT' Tattoo on his inner bicep.\"",
      "Gaither\u2019s sensitivity to what he described as the \"disturbing\" imagery in Hegseth's tattoos came at a time when the military was grappling with the fact that\u00a0dozens of active and former\u00a0service members had participated in the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Gaither, who confirmed to ABC News the contents of his complaint -- which he wrote just one week after Jan. 6, emphasized that\u00a0\"this wasn't then and isn't now a personal attack towards Pete Hegseth.\"",
      "\"The information received and [the] email sent on January 14th was the protocol that had to be followed because of the position assignment that I was assigned to,\"\u00a0explained Gaither, who was at the time assigned as the Guards' head of security. \"The protocol was followed and would be followed again if this issue involved any other service member, myself included.\"",
      "As ABC News has reported,\u00a0Hegseth fired back\u00a0at the initial coverage of this matter in The Associated Press by claiming it was \"Anti-Christian bigotry.\"",
      "\"They can target me \u2014 I don\u2019t give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD,\" Hegseth wrote on X.",

      "\u201cThis will directly impact people\u2019s pocketbooks,\u201d one expert said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised a major escalation of the nation\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Trump has proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods, and a tax of between 10% and 20% on every product imported from all U.S. trading partners.",
      "Economists widely forecast that tariffs of this magnitude would increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "Trump's tariffs would cost the average U.S. household about $2,600 per year, according to an estimate from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Some products would likely undergo much more significant price increases than others, experts told ABC News, pointing to items like electronics and toys that rely heavily on imports.",
      "\u201cThis will directly impact people\u2019s pocketbooks,\u201d Rob Handfield, a professor of operations and supply-chain management at North Carolina State University, told ABC News.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the Trump transition team rebuked concern about potential price increases as a result of his tariff proposals.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted\u00a0tariffs\u00a0against China that created jobs, spurred investment, and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and unshackling American energy,\" Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the transition team, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about which products will be most impacted by Trump\u2019s tariffs:",
      "Electronics",
      "Smartphones, tablets and laptops are among the array of electronics that would see price increases as a result of tariffs, experts said. Video cameras, headphones and video game consoles would also be impacted.",
      "\u201cElectronics are basically ubiquitous,\u201d Raymond Robertson, a professor of trade and public policy at Texas A&M University, told ABC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this wouldn\u2019t be incredibly disruptive.\u201d",
      "Prices of laptops and tablets could rise as much as 46%, while smartphone prices could jump 26%, according to a study published last month by the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that represents tech firms.",
      "Many of those goods are imported from China, which would face the steepest tariffs under Trump\u2019s proposal, Handfield said. Since Trump plans to also impose tariffs on all imported goods, manufacturers would not be able to circumvent the tariffs by shifting production to other countries, he added.",
      "Imports account for roughly 90% of video and audio electronic equipment sold to U.S. consumers, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis found in 2017. Meanwhile, 88% of electronic computers and 78% of small electric appliances are imported, the BEA said.",
      "\u201cThe prices of electronics would definitely go up,\u201d Handfield said.",
      "Clothes",
      "Jeans, T-shirts, sweatshirts and a host of other apparel items are set to go up in price if Trump\u2019s tariffs take effect, experts said.",
      "The U.S. imports more than 80% of clothing items offered up by retailers, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data last year showed.",
      "For decades, the U.S. has increasingly relied on apparel manufacturers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and other low-cost markets abroad, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cObviously, and not surprisingly, apparel is very strongly imported,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The price of a set of 500 apparel goods ranging from swimwear to gloves to baby clothes could rise as much as 20% in response to the potential tariffs, according to a study earlier this month by the National Retail Federation, a trade association that represents retailers.",
      "After the proposed tariffs, a $50 woman\u2019s cotton sweater could cost consumers as much as $60 while the price of men\u2019s jeans could rise from $80 to $96, the NRF found.",
      "Toys",
      "Dolls, stuffed animals and board games are among a group of toys highly vulnerable to tariff-related price increases, experts said.",
      "Imports account for about 90% of toys and dolls sold to U.S. consumers, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data in 2017 showed.",
      "Top U.S. toy makers are \u201cvery, very dependent on China,\u201d Handfield said. \u201cAlmost all toys are manufactured in Asia.\u201d",
      "The price of toys could soar as much as 55%, amounting to about $14 billion in lost U.S. consumer spending power, the NRF found.",
      "The price of a $50 tricycle could jump an additional $28, while a plush toy could climb from $17 to $27.",
      "Economists face challenges forecasting the exact price increase since it remains unclear whether firms involved in the supply chain for products, such as toys, will take on a share of the added cost by relinquishing some profits or will pass along all of the cost to customers, Miller said.",
      "The current body of academic research, however, suggests that many companies will add the full cost of tariffs onto the consumer.",
      "\u201cIt is difficult to predict the exact price increase,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut it will be inflationary.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:44:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Dan Osborn, who ran an unusually competitive U.S. Senate campaign in deep-red Nebraska as an independent, is launching a new political action committee.",
    "story": [
      "\"We've created something pretty special here in Nebraska,\" Osborn told ABC News.",
      "Dan Osborn, a former union president and Navy veteran who ran an unusually competitive U.S. Senate campaign in deep-red Nebraska as an independent, is launching a new political action committee meant to help working class candidates like himself run for office.",
      "\"At least the idea is to help other people like me, who are teachers, nurses, plumbers, carpenters, bus drivers, to be able to run for office in their particular counties, states, areas, and we can help them accomplish that,\" Osborn told ABC News in an interview by phone on Monday.",
      "\"You know, we've created something pretty special here in Nebraska. And I just want to continue that.\"",
      "The organization, the Working Class Heroes Fund, is a new hybrid political action committee (PAC) that will support working-class candidates and mobilize working class voters, according to an announcement and a PAC spokesperson. The group will also advocate for labor unions, including supporting strike funds, which help union workers cover expenses if they go on strike.",
      "Osborn hopes the PAC's work will help bring more workers' perspectives to government, about how \"people don't want handouts from their government\u2026 they just want to know when you go and you put in your time, you put in your eight hours work for eight hours pay, that your paycheck matters, right?\" Osborn said. \"And going to be able to afford your mortgage and your cars and hopefully set aside money for college and some Christmases.\"",
      "The PAC is a new organization and not a conversion of Osborn's campaign committee, according to a spokesperson. It will vet and consider which working-class candidates to support on a case-by-case basis, and will support candidates across political parties.",
      "Could supporting candidates across party lines lead to pushback? Osborn, who eschewed party labels or support during his Senate bid, feels that doesn't matter.",
      "\"I've never really understood why, if you're a part of a party, that you have to have a specific set of beliefs, and you have to reject the other set of beliefs, and vice versa,\" he said.",
      "Osborn had campaigned explicitly on his labor bonafides, including his work as a steamfitter and mechanic, as well as his insistence that he'd be a truly independent voice in the Senate.",
      "On Election Day, Osborn lost to Fischer by 8 percentage points -- not as thin of a margin as some polls had predicted, but well ahead of the margin between President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris; Harris lost statewide to Trump by 21 points. (Harris did lead Trump in the state's 2nd Congressional District, netting her one Electoral College vote.)",
      "Asked if he was surprised by the margin between him and Fischer, Osborn said, \"Yes, I was, actually -- and it sucked. I suppose if I had to describe it in one word, it sucked.",
      "\"You know, I really thought that the people in Nebraska saw the value in electing a working-class person,\" he said, but a late influx of money into the race supporting his opponent made a difference. \"Does it hurt a little bit? Sure, but again, I think we created something here.\"",
      "His family is \"not taking [the loss] as good as I am,\" Osborn said later with a chuckle. \"Everybody goes back to school and we go back -- I'm going back to work tomorrow, and my wife, she was working the whole entire time to help pay for the endeavor. But, you know, we were all hoping for different results, and we didn't see it.\"",
      "Osborn said he was not surprised by the larger margin between Trump and Harris, given Nebraska's deep Republican lean.",
      "One of the trickier dynamics in the race was that as Osborn tried to maintain an independent image, some national Democrats or Democratic groups indicated that if he was elected to the Senate, he would caucus with Democrats. (Throughout his campaign, Osborn emphasized he would not plan to caucus with either party.)",
      "Did that hurt his campaign? Osborn thinks it made a difference.",
      "\"I can't consult with those people. I don't even know who they are. They're making money off of my name, which is completely ridiculous,\" he said, adding that he wants independent expenditures out of politics more generally.",
      "His own organization, however, is allowed to make independent expenditures, as a hybrid PAC. Asked about that, Osborn acknowledged the irony but said the PAC will support candidates who support campaign finance reform and want an end to how money influences politics.",
      "\"The independent expenditure is part of the problem, and I would love nothing more than our elected officials to get rid of my PAC because it shouldn't exist. You know what I mean? None of this should exist.\"",
      "Even as he launches the PAC, however, Osborn said he is also heading back to work as a steamfitter.",
      "\"The debt collectors do not care that I ran the closest Senate race in the country, unfortunately,\" he told ABC News. (Pre-Election Day polling had found the race among the closest Senate races in the country, although the final results have been closer in other Senate races, such as in Michigan and Pennsylvania.) \"So I got to pay my bills. So yes, I'm going back to work.\"",
      "Would he run again for public office? Osborn said he wouldn't rule it out: \"I'm open to everything that's going to be on the table.\"",
      "\"In my neighborhood, there's a position open: the dogcatcher's open,\" he added, \"So I should probably start there,\" he said, although he immediately clarified, \"That's a joke.\"",

      "It's now clear why.",
      "His Cabinet picks of Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence raised eyebrows and alarms. But his selection of now former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general prompted audible gasps from House Republicans huddled behind closed doors and later public bewilderment from some GOP senators.",
      "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reports Trump will move full steam ahead, seeing the nominations as a critical test of loyalty for the new Republican leadership on Capitol Hill.",
      "If that loyalty fails, Karl reports, Trump's team is eyeing a nuclear option to bypass Congress altogether: having lawmakers adjourn, or forcing them to adjourn, so he could install his picks without the \"advise and consent\" confirmation process in the Senate -- a key legislative power also called for in the Constitution.",
      "It would be a maneuver in line with Trump's push for more unchecked executive power in his second term, something Karl calls part of his \"dictator on Day 1\" strategy.",
      "\"This kind of contrivance, I think, would be unprecedented,\" said Harry Litman, a former U.S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general who teaches constitutional law.",
      "Experts who spoke with ABC News could not recall a time when the Senate and House agreed to recess solely for the purpose of allowing a president to place controversial figures in powerful government positions.",
      "Newly elected Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who will take control of the chamber in January, said Republicans were going to \"explore all options\" when asked by ABC News Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott if he would move forward with recess appointments.",
      "Thune expressed a desire for the Senate to hold confirmation hearings, which could prove to be messy battles for people like Gaetz. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer told ABC's Scott that Gaetz wouldn't be confirmed if the vote took place now.",
      "Should a nominee face seemingly insurmountable headwinds, Trump could ask both chambers to recess in order to make the appointments himself. But what happens if the House and Senate don't see eye to eye on a recess?",
      "Article II Section 3 of the Constitution provides for a president to adjourn Congress should there be a \"case of disagreement.\"",
      "The provision reads, in part: \"On extraordinary Occasions ... in Case of Disagreement ... with respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.\"",
      "That's never been done before, said Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University.",
      "If Trump were to go that route, it would likely face legal challenges and potentially wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on the issue of recess appointments after then-President Barack Obama used a short break in congressional business to place officials on the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The decision in NLRB v. Noel Canning ultimately gave the president power to fill vacancies in recesses greater than 10 days.",
      "But Justice Anton Scalia, in a concurring opinion, argued against the broad guidelines the justices set.",
      "\"The Court's decision transforms the recess-appointment power from a tool carefully designed to fill a narrow and specific need into a weapon to be wielded by future Presidents against future Senates,\" Scalia wrote.",
      "Joining his concurrence were three conservative justices who still sit on the bench: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas.",
      "\"For any untried stratagem of the sort Trump may be contemplating, there will be an uncertain outcome in the Supreme Court,\" Litman said.",
      "But Chafetz noted that the current Supreme Court has taken a broad view of presidential authority, like earlier this year in its immunity ruling.",
      "\"This Supreme Court is one that is very invested in executive power,\" Chafetz said. \"It's also a Supreme Court that has been very friendly to Trump generally, and so I would be surprised if they stepped in to block recess appointments under those circumstances.\"",
      "Recess appointments have been used by past presidents to fill administration roles, including more than 100 times by Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Bush and Obama made recess appointments at the \"deputy\" level but not for Cabinet posts.",
      "No recess appointments were made by the previous Trump administration or the Biden administration.",
      "During his first term, Trump floated the idea as he expressed frustration with Senate Democrats opposing some of his nominees, but he never carried it out.",
      "This time, he would be trying to do so while Republicans have a trifecta: control of the White House, the Senate and the House.",
      "\"That's his own party revolting and balking,\" Litman said, \"and if he's somehow able to bypass that, that's an even greater amassing of power on his part.\"",
      "Chafetz called it a \"dominance play\" from Trump.",
      "\"He wants to show that he can make the Senate abase itself, right?\" he said. \"He wants the entire Republican conference in the Senate to do this thing that's a show of fealty to him that involves not just the act of confirming his nominees, but actually adjourning itself so as to give up its power and let him do this unilaterally.\"",

    "summary": "After weekend with Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson laid out a tentative plan to keep the government funded that could tee up a funding fight in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.",
    "story": [
      "Speaker's short-term plan could cause a funding fight in Trump's first 100 days.",
      "After a weekend spent with President-elect Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson laid out a tentative plan on Sunday to keep the government funded that, if passed, could tee up a funding fight in the earliest days of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "During an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Johnson said if the House can\u2019t finish individual funding bills then \u201cwe\u2019ll have a temporary measure. I think that would go into the first part of next year and allow us the necessary time to get this done.\u201d",
      "Congress must take some action to avert a government shutdown before Dec. 20, when current funding will expire.",
      "But the plan Johnson outlined is far from what other Republicans in both the House and Senate have previously advocated for. Many Republicans were hopeful Congress would act during the lame duck session to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year in October.",
      "How Congress proceeds in the next few weeks could set the table for what Trump\u2019s earliest legislative actions will be.",
      "The plan Johnson outlined would see current government funding levels extended through March, giving a Republican-controlled Congress the ability to shape a funding bill almost immediately after Trump assumes the presidency.",
      "Though Johnson said he\u2019ll continue to work to fund the government before the December deadline, he ultimately endorsed a short term funding bill that would kick the deadline into next spring.",
      "\u201cI think that would be ultimately a good move because the country would benefit from it, because then you'd have Republican control. And we'd have a little more say in what those spending bills are,\u201d Johnson told Fox News.",
      "If Congress waits until the spring to fund the government, Republicans will control the House, Senate and White House, possibly buying them more leverage in negotiations, but it hasn\u2019t always worked out that way.",
      "Trump was handed this sort of situation as he entered office for his first term. In December 2016, with Trump having clinched the presidency and Republicans preparing to take control of both the House and Senate the next month, Congress decided to kick the deadline to fund the government to April 2017.",
      "But that extended funding deadline didn\u2019t necessarily buy Republican major wins. Though Trump did have more ability to influence that funding bill as a result of the delay, he still ended up having to make concessions, including a delay in funding of his border wall, in order to get the government funded in time. Congress, hamstrung by a pending funding deadline, spent much of Trump\u2019s first 100 days squabbling over funding rather than focusing on building out new policy.",
      "Ultimately, Trump signed a largely bipartisan funding bill into law in early May, averting a government shutdown by mere hours.",
      "Johnson\u2019s proposal could also potentially protect him from a public funding fight with his far-right flank just weeks before the House will once again vote on whether Johnson keeps his gavel, though these members are also generally opposed to short-term funding bills like the one Johnson is pitching.",
      "Trump endorsed Johnson last week to lead House Republicans in the 119th Congress, calling him a \u201cgood guy.\u201d",
      "Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his role largely because of his failure to enact budget cuts palatable to his far-right members.",
      "Keeping a low profile with a short-term funding extension may, therefore, be just what Johnson needs headed into the speaker election.",
      "Johnson\u2019s pitch is in sharp difference from what other Republicans have telegraphed in recent weeks.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters he wants to pass government funding through the end of September 2025 to avoid any delays in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.",
      "Senate Republicans have similarly expressed interest in locking in a deal to keep the government funded through to October.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is the top Republican appropriator in the Senate. Last week, before Johnson outlined his plan, Collins said she would continue to advocate for Congress to fund the government through September with regular-order appropriations bills instead of a short-term bill like the one Johnson is proposing.",
      "\u201cIn my judgment that is better for the incoming administration because that gives them a clean slate, and they can start focusing on the budget for Fiscal Year '26,\u201d Collins said last week.",
      "Democrats also have cards to play. The government funding deadline falls before the new Congress is sworn in and before Trump is inaugurated. With the Senate in their control, Democrats are better positioned to negotiate a full-year funding bill that locks in their priorities now than they will be in the new year.",
      "But any effort to complete a full year\u2019s worth of funding bills will need to be quickly expedited to get things completed before the deadline. The Senate has still not passed any of the individual funding bills, and top appropriators need to agree on a top-line funding bill.",

      "Frommer's philosophy \u2014 stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants \u2014 changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\u201d That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn\u2019t hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship. The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn\u2019t visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer\u2019s guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer\u2019s advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks. \"It was really pioneering stuff,\u201d Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \u201cthat would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\u201d",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\" The concept no longer made sense when hotels could not be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire did not disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer \u2014 in a David vs. Goliath triumph \u2014 got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\u201cI never dreamed at my age I\u2019d be working this hard,\u201d he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show. He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony postings. And he coined the phrase \u201cTrump Slump\u201d in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight. Eventually he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe,\" and a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece, distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \u201cEurope on 5 Dollars a Day,\u201d was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Eventually Frommer gave up law to write the guides full-time. Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \u201cmost Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. \u2026 And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn\u2019t have to be well-heeled.\u201d",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \u201cI fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\u201d he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap, and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\u201d",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer\u2019s survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:26:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",
      "The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century.",

      "Authorities say only six monkeys are still on the loose after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Six monkeys were still on the loose early Monday after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research, according to authorities.",
      "Two more Rhesus macaques were trapped Sunday outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, bringing the total of recovered monkeys to 37 of the 43 that escaped, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post.",
      "Both monkeys recaptured Sunday were examined and were in \u201cexcellent condition,\u201d said Westergaard, who was present when they were recovered.",
      "\u201cI can attest with absolute certainty that their spirits were high and they showed all the outward signs of being happy well-adjusted monkeys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very pleased that the animals recovered thus far are in such good condition, and that they show no ill effects from their outdoor adventure.\u201d",
      "All the monkeys taken back to the compound have been fed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and monkey biscuits, which are a high protein Purina Monkey Chow that is specially formulated for the rhesus macaques, Westergaard said.",
      "Two other monkeys were spotted near the traps Sunday afternoon and Alpha Genesis planned to begin trapping efforts before dawn Monday and continue through the day.",
      "Forty-three monkeys made a break for it Nov. 6 after an employee at what locals call \u201cthe monkey farm\u201d did not fully lock their enclosure, police said.",
      "There are three gates keeping the monkeys inside their containment area and a worker is supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure allowing the primates to escape, Westergaard told WCSC-TV last week.",
      "Westergaard said it appears the worker made a mistake and did not intentionally leave the gates where the monkeys could escape.",
      "\u201cMy understanding is that immediately after the incident occurred, the employee\u2019s supervisor approached her and stated that she could be terminated if it was determined that there was no structural failure which led to the escape,\u201d Westergaard told the TV station. \u201cI am told at that point the employee walked off the job and has not returned.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis has said efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "On Monday, a group called Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent another letter to federal officials asking for fines and further inspection of Alpha Genesis for animal mistreatment.",
      "The letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture said a monkey was found dead with its head stuck in a fence and a second strangled in gauze used to secure water bottles. The letter also details several earlier escapes, including one where a monkey had its arm ripped off and another had its arm broken by a tranquilizer dart.",
      "The incidents involved about 30 monkeys and happened in 2022 or earlier. The letter includes emails and other documents from Alpha Genesis given to the group by someone inside the company, wrote Michael Budkie, the group's executive director.",
      "\u201cThis is not animal care, this is neglect and abuse. Though these violations may be back a couple of years ... there is no reason to assume that such a broad set of violations will be totally remedied,\u201d Budkie wrote.",
      "Alpha Genesis did not return a phone call or email asking about the letter.",
      "The USDA has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020. The facility\u2019s most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues and veterinarians found minor problems in only one of the facility\u2019s past six inspections.",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Twenty years since Bill Clinton opened his presidential library and museum before a rain-soaked crowd, the area around the glass and steel facility has been transformed.",
      "The museum fueled development around Little Rock's once-sleepy downtown, with a former industrial area to its east blossoming into an entertainment district. Next to the building, cyclists and runners regularly cross what was once a railroad bridge spanning the Arkansas River.",
      "But little has changed inside the museum, which features many of the same exhibits unveiled two decades ago: touchscreen displays where visitors can pull up Clinton's daily schedules, replicas of the Oval Office and Cabinet Room, electronic tickers scrolling with the 42nd president's accomplishments.",
      "That's about to change, as library officials are marking the 20th anniversary of its opening and planning for a major update and expansion that will add Hilary Rodham Clinton's personal archives.",
      "\u201cWe need to refresh the current exhibits, the technology,\u201d Stephanie Streett, the executive director of the Clinton Foundation said.. \u201cThe story is not going to change, the story of the Clinton administration and the work he did.\u201d",
      "But library officials are looking at how to add context to major decisions that were made during the Clinton administration. The changes comes as views have evolved among fellow Democrats about some of Clinton's accomplishments, including his 1994 crime bill. Library officials say they plan to revisit some of those decisions and their impact on today.",
      "\u201cIt does remain an interesting era, and the Clinton administration obviously shaped the 1990s,\u201d Jay Barth, the library's director, said. \u201cSo I think that's the story we tell, the interplay between that era of the 1990s and this administration.\u201d",
      "Library officials haven't given a timeline or cost for the planned expansion. Streett said it would also include more community spaces for events, programs and student groups.",
      "Clinton remains an active political figure and has evolved into a elder statesman figure in the Democratic Party, delivering a primetime speech and campaigning on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential election. His library turned 20 on Monday, the day before he releases a memoir about his years since leaving office in 2001.",
      "The expansion will allow the library to tell more about Hillary Rodham Clinton. She has remained a high-profile figure since her time as first lady through her work in the Senate, as secretary of state and her two unsuccessful presidential bids.",
      "The expansion will include an institute that will serve as a hub for the former first lady\u2019s nonprofit and advocacy work. Hillary Clinton\u2019s papers from her time as first lady are already held in the presidential library\u2019s archives.",
      "\u201cI think it is a fascinating, distinctive story that really resonates with a different audience, a slightly younger audience, but really an audience of all ages because of how important her role was in American life,\u201d Barth said.",
      "The library is the centerpiece of a 29-acre (nearly 12-hectare) park that was once a warehouse district. The campus includes the University of Arkansas' Clinton School of Public Service.",
      "More than 5 million people have visited the center since the facility opened in a ceremony that drew dignitaries and celebrities. The library remains a major draw for the city, with tour groups regularly visiting it and local groups holding events at the facility's great hall.",
      "The tourism attention is what library planners had hoped for when the site, located next to an interstate in the city's downtown, was chosen.",
      "\u201cWe knew we would get the political attention because of the Clinton presidency,\u201d said Skip Rutherford, the former head of the Clinton Foundation who oversaw the library's planning, construction and opening. \u201cWe knew there would be the political attention, both good and bad. What we hoped for was we\u2019d get the tourism attention.\u201d",
      "The library is marking the opening's anniversary with a series of events in early December that will include a conversation with the former president about his new book. The library has also been selling souvenirs to mark the occasion. They include a Christmas ornament that features the image of an umbrella \u2014 a reminder of the soggy opening ceremony \u2014 as well as mugs and postcards with images from that day.",
      "A week after the election, the library's visitors included Mary Jordan from Phoenix, who stopped by on the way home from North Carolina. Jordan said visiting the library made her appreciate even more Clinton's presidency and his ideals.",
      "\u201cIt certainly makes me appreciate America and what we stand for and our democracy, and I hope we never lose that,\u201d she said."

      "Production rates slowed to a crawl, and the Federal Aviation Administration capped production of the 737 MAX at 38 planes per month, a threshold Boeing had yet to reach when the machinists' strike halted assembly lines."

      "A Georgia appeals court has canceled oral arguments that were scheduled for next month on the appeal of a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought agains...",
      "ATHENS, Ga. -- A Georgia appeals court on Monday canceled oral arguments that were scheduled for next month on the appeal of a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought against President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trump and other defendants had asked the Georgia Court of Appeals to hold oral arguments in the case, and the court had set those arguments for Dec. 5. But in a one-line order with no further explanation, the appeals court said that hearing \u201cis hereby canceled until further order of this Court.\u201d",
      "A Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 indicted Trump and 18 others, accusing them of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Four defendants have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.",
      "But with Trump set to return to the White House in January, the future of the case against the once and future president was already in question even if the Court of Appeals ultimately says Willis shouldn't be disqualified.",
      "Trump and other defendants filed the appeal seeking to get Willis and her office removed from the case and to have the case dismissed. They argue that a romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Court of Appeals.",
      "McAfee wrote that \u201creasonable questions\u201d over whether Willis and Wade had testified truthfully about the timing of their relationship \u201cfurther underpin the finding of an appearance of impropriety and the need to make proportional efforts to cure it.\u201d He allowed Willis to remain on the case only if Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.",
      "The allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Willis and Wade\u2019s personal lives were aired in court in mid-February."

      "Figures released Monday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos and their online partners won $213.6 million in October, surpassing September's previous record of $208 million.",
      "When in-person casino winnings, internet and sports betting revenue are included, the nine casinos, two horse tracks that take sports bets and their online partners won just under $500 million in October, an increase of 2.6% from a year ago.",
      "But internet and sports betting money is not solely for the casinos to keep; it must be shared with outside parties including sports books and tech platforms. For that reason, the casinos consider money won from in-person customers to be their core business.",
      "And that business continues to lag for two-thirds of the casinos. Only three casinos \u2014 Borgata, Hard Rock and Ocean \u2014 won more from in-person gamblers last month than they did in October 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "The swing toward internet gambling and away from in-person casino gambling accelerated during the pandemic, and is becoming a more permanent feature of New Jersey's gambling landscape.",
      "Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said the trend is becoming more obvious.",
      "\u201cDespite a historically dry and very mild October, brick-and-mortar gaming operators in Atlantic City did not see strong gains over 2023, instead declining by 8.5% year-over-year,\u201d she said.",
      "But total revenue for the casinos was up over 9% from a year ago, \u201cin no small part due to internet gaming, which continued a record streak,\u201d she said.",
      "James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, noted that internet revenue surpassed in-person casino revenue for the first time in October, excluding the few months in 2020 when the physical casinos were closed due to the pandemic.",
      "He also noted that internet gambling revenue exceeded $200 million for the second straight month.",
      "\u201cThese two accomplishments are emblematic of the importance of online gaming as a component of the evolving casino business,\u201d he said.",
      "In terms of in-person gambling revenue, Borgata won $53.4 million, down 6.1% from a year earlier; Hard Rock won $40.8 million, down 1%; Ocean won $32.8 million, down over 24%; Tropicana won $17.6 million, up 7.4%; Harrah's won $15.7 million, down 11.5%; Caesars won just under $15 million, up 4.1%; Resorts won $12 million, down over 9%; Bally's won $11.4 million, down 7.8%; and Golden Nugget won $9.6 million, down over 20%.",

    "story": [
      "Survivors of clergy sexual abuse are urging the Vatican to adopt the same zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002",
      "ROME -- Survivors of clergy sexual abuse urged the Vatican on Monday to expand its zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002 to the rest of the world, arguing that children everywhere should be protected from predator priests.",
      "The U.S. norms, adopted at the height of the abuse scandal there, say a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established under church law.",
      "That \u201cone strike and you\u2019re out\u201d policy in the U.S. has long stood out as the toughest in the church. It is held up by some as the gold standard, by others as excessive and by still others as imperfect but better than most. It was adopted by U.S. bishops as they scrambled to try to regain credibility following the revelations of abuse and cover-up in Boston documented by the Boston Globe\u2019s \u201cSpotlight\u201d series.",
      "Since then, the church abuse scandal has erupted globally, and survivors from around the world said Monday there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. norms couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be applied universally. They called for changes in the church\u2019s in-house canon law and reasoned they could be approved since the Holy See already approved the norms for the U.S. church.",
      "\u201cDespite Pope Francis\u2019 repeated calls for zero tolerance on abuse, his words have yet to lead to any real action,\u201d said Gemma Hickey, a transgender survivor of abuse and the president of the global survivor network Ending Clergy Abuse.",
      "The proposal launched at a press conference was hammered out during an unusual meeting in June in Rome between survivors and some of the Catholic hierarchy's top priestly experts on preventing abuse. It was described by participants at the time as a \u201chistoric collaboration\u201d between two groups that often talk past one another, given victims' deep distrust of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "The priestly participants in that meeting included the Rev. Hans Zollner, who heads the church\u2019s main academic think tank on safeguarding; the No. 2 at the Vatican\u2019s child protection advisory board, Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera; and the Gregorian University\u2019s canon law dean, the Rev. Ulrich Rhode as well as diplomats from the U.S., Australian and other embassies.",
      "However, there was apparently no one from the Vatican legal office, secretariat of state or the discipline section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which processes all abuse cases worldwide and largely sets policy on applying the church\u2019s canon law \u2014 albeit in secret since its cases are never published.",
      "As a result, it was unclear what would become of the proposed policy changes, given the U.S. norms only came about because U.S. bishops pushed the Vatican to approve them, driven by their outraged flocks and insurance companies.",
      "Nicholas Cafardi, a U.S. canon lawyer who was an original member of the U.S. National Review Board that provided input to the 2002 U.S. norms, said globalizing that policy into universal church law \u201cwould be one of the logical next steps\u201d for Francis to take to continue the fight against abuse.",
      "But Cafardi, author of \u201cBefore Dallas,\u201d about the lead-up to the 2002 Dallas bishops' meeting that approved the norms, said that some bishops today bristle at how the policy limits their authority and freedom. And in a telephone interview, he noted that even in the U.S., the norms are only still in place because the U.S. bishops keep formally asking to keep them, which he acknowledged was a \u201cweakness\u201d in the system.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that a good protection would be \u2018Let\u2019s just make it universal law,\u2019\u201d said Cafardi. \u201cOnce you have that law, you don\u2019t have to worry about the bishops asking for it in country after country. It\u2019s just the law.\"",
      "However, the proposal faces an uphill battle since the Vatican in recent years has repeatedly insisted on \u201cproportionality\u201d in its sentences for abuse, refusing to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and taking into account cultural differences in countries where abuse isn't as openly discussed as it is in the West.",
      "That has resulted in seemingly light punishments for even confirmed cases of abuse which, in the U.S., would have resulted in a priest being permanently removed from ministry.",

      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",

      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",

      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",

      "\u201cThis is a matter of grave concern that, most respectfully, must be addressed immediately,\u201d the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian, who already has scheduled a bail hearing for Friday for Combs.

    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden is requesting nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other natural disasters",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden is requesting nearly $100 billion in emergency disaster aid after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other natural disasters, telling lawmakers that the money is \u201curgently needed.\u201d",
      "The letter Monday to House Speaker Mike Johnson comes as lawmakers meet during a lame-duck session to finish key priorities before making way for a new Congress and the incoming Trump administration. Biden said he has met firsthand with those harmed by the storms and he heard what residents and businesses needed from the federal government.",
      "\"Additional resources are critical to continue to support these communities,\u201d Biden said.",
      "The largest share of the money, about $40 billion, would go to the main disaster relief fund at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The fund helps with debris removal, repairing public infrastructure and providing financial assistance to survivors.",
      "Biden said the fund would face a shortfall this budget year without additional money. He said that would not only affect the agency's ability to provide lifesaving assistance to survivors, but also would slow recovery efforts from prior disasters.",
      "An additional $24 billion would help farmers that have experienced crop or livestock losses, and $12 billion would go toward helping communities recover through block grants administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Some $8 billion more would help rebuild and repair highways and bridges in more than 40 states and territories. The administration is also seeking $4 billion for long-term water system upgrades to mitigate future damage from natural disasters.",
      "The Small Business Administration has run out of money for a program that provides low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners trying to rebuild after a disaster. Biden is seeking $2 billion for that program. Several other agencies would also receive emergency funds if Congress agrees to the full request.",
      "Lawmakers were expecting a hefty number from the administration. Johnson, R-La., said Congress will evaluate the request and \u201cwe\u2019ll make sure we deliver for the hurricane victims and the people that have suffered from that.\u201d",
      "Johnson had also visited western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene to assess the damage. At the time, he said Congress would act in a bipartisan fashion to help communities recover, but he also said it would be \u201dthe appropriate amount that the federal government should do.\u201d",
      "With many Republicans campaigning on reducing federal spending, there could be some debate about portions of Biden's request. The federal government doesn't help with every disaster. It generally gets involved only if the needs are above the ability of a community or state to handle.",
      "Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said he opposes the aid package requested by the president because it's not offset with spending cuts elsewhere.",
      "\"This is a spending spree,\u201d Norman said.",
      "Republicans are also outraged that a FEMA employee directed workers helping hurricane survivors not to go to homes with yard signs supporting Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The agency's leader, Administrator Deanne Criswell, said the employee was fired and the directive was a clear violation of the agency's core values to help people regardless of political affiliation.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., however, called the president's request a \u201cgood start.\u201d He said residents of Asheville, North Carolina, are still under an advisory to boil their water, \u201cand that\u2019s not the worst thing happening there.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to get a signal to them that we\u2019re going to support them,\u201d Tillis said.",
      "The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to hear Wednesday from the heads of several of the government agencies that would receive funding through Biden's request. It's possible that emergency aid could be attached to any spending bill designed to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires Dec. 20.",
      "Biden noted that Congress had provided more than $90 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina nearly two decades ago, and more than $50 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2013. He urged Congress to take \u201cimmediate action.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust as the Congress acted then, it is our sworn duty now to deliver the necessary resources to ensure that everyone in communities reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton \u2014 and those still recovering from previous disasters \u2014 have the Federal resources they need and deserve,\u201d Biden wrote.",

      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",

      "Barbara Mahoney, a NOAA biologist examining the whale, told the Anchorage Daily News the whale was likely 1 to 3 years old.",
      "Fin whales are the second-largest whale species, according to NOAA Fisheries, and fully grown can reach up to 85 feet (25.9 meters) long and weigh between 40 tons and 80 tons. Strikes by ships, entanglements in fishing gear, underwater noise and the effects of climate change are among the threats that fin whales face, according to the agency.",
      "Mandy Keogh, a NOAA marine mammal stranding coordinator, said fin whales generally aren't seen this close to Anchorage and that recent high tides may have pushed the animal further into the Knik Arm.",
      "People trekked across the mudflats to see the whale, which NOAA biologists and staff from Alaska Veterinary Pathology Services had anchored to the shore Sunday so they would be able to gather samples from the animal. But even after samples are analyzed, it can be difficult to determine a cause of death because of decomposition or a lack of obvious injuries, Keogh said.",

      "If it hadn't been for the squirrels, George Matthew's attempt to become a cocoa bean producer might have failed.",
      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",
      "\"This complex process involves several stages and the activity of various micro-organisms, which help develop the beans' flavour, aroma, and colour,\" he says.",

      "It is investing in schemes to develop hybrid cocoa plants, that are more productive than existing varieties.",
      "In addition there are schemes to train farmers on the latest techniques for growing and processing beans.",
      "\u201cThere is a vast opportunity for Indian farmers to enter into cocoa cultivation and avail the benefits,\" says Dr Femina, who works in the government department tasked with developing cocoa production.",

      "In the project's orchard existing high-performing varieties are cross-bred with exotic species.",
      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",
      "Mr Chordia also runs an agricultural school, where  farmers are shown the latest innovations in fermenting and drying beans.",
      "\"We are constantly focussing on improving the post-harvest practices for cocoa farmers in India,\" he says.",
      "He adds that Indian farmers need to be producing higher quality beans.",
      "\"We are not able to compete with international players in the bulk cocoa bean segment,\u201d he says.",
      "While there has been improvement, Indian producers have some way to go.",
      "\"Over the last decade, in the fine-flavour cocoa bean segment, India has started to get noticed... but it will be several years before all Indian fine flavour cocoa beans reach a stage of large-scale international recognition.\"",
      "Back in Kerala, Dr Matthew reflects on his decade as a cocoa farmer.",
      "\"It's a tricky plant,\" he says. \"Last year I had no yield. So no farmer can depend solely on cocoa - one has to plant other trees along with it.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:01:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Spray foam insulation was previously subsidised in England under the government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners with spray foam insulation are struggling to sell or remortgage as some major lenders are rejecting properties with it fitted, the BBC has found.",
      "A quarter of the UK's biggest mortgage providers will not lend against homes with spray foam in the roof, our research suggests.",
      "It is estimated as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with much of it installed under the previous government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "\"We were blissfully unaware of any issues to do with it until we put the house on the market,\" said Wendy Rowe, whose family struggled to sell her late father\u2019s home and paid thousands to have the insulation removed.",
      "Some mortgage firms are reluctant to deal with homes with spray foam insulation due to concerns over poor fitting leaving moisture trapped and roof timbers at risk of decay.",
      "But the Insulation Manufacturers Association said spray foam can be beneficial if properly installed, and it was worried homeowners could be needlessly driven to \"cowboy\" removals companies.",
      "Ms Rowe told the BBC that when her father Alan Chawner was offered spray foam insulation in his loft, he thought it would make his ex-council property in Leicester  warmer and cut his energy bills.",
      "As a pensioner who claimed the attendance allowance, the entire \u00a34,331 cost of the  installation was covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England until 31 March 2021.",
      "'Left high and dry'",
      "However, the work was not up to scratch, according to a report by Stephen Hodgson, the former boss of the Property Care Association (PCA) who now inspects properties with spray foam and trains surveyors.",
      "After sales stalled and difficult conversations with lenders, Ms Rowe agreed to replace the roof entirely, splitting the cost of nearly \u00a310,000 with new buyers.",
      "She said it has cost the family thousands more in surveyors' and administration fees and utility bills.",
      "The firm that installed the spray foam, SealSixty, gave the family \u00a3400 as a gesture of goodwill and said the work met all the requirements set out by the Green Homes Grant scheme at the time.",
      "Ms Rowe said that her family had been \"left high and dry\".",
      "\"It was installed under a government initiative, and you really don\u2019t expect them to turn their back,\" she said.",
      "What is spray foam insulation?",
      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "While a recent report by the Health and Safety Executive highlighted situations where using open cell was low-risk, it cautioned against applying it directly to roof tiles.",
      "Homes insulated in government scheme go mouldy",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",
      "The nature of spray foam can make it tricky for valuers acting on behalf of lenders to inspect the condition of roof timbers.",
      "When the BBC contacted the 20 largest lenders in the UK, five of them, TSB Bank, Skipton Building Society, Co-operative Bank, Principality and equity release lender Aviva - said they did not lend against properties where spray foam is found in the roof space.",
      "The Yorkshire Building Society and Metro Bank said they would not usually lend where there is a significant amount of spray foam.",
      "Equity release provider More 2 Life told the BBC it will only lend on properties with spray foam where it was fitted as part of an authorised new build and has the necessary documentation.",
      "Other lenders such as Lloyds, Nationwide, Barclays, the NatWest Group and Santander have said they consider applications on a case-by-case basis, and will take a valuer's report into account.",
      "They may, however, ask homeowners for documentation showing it has been installed correctly or for a specialist report to be carried out.",
      "In 2023, the PCA published an inspection protocol in a bid to help surveyors and lenders assess any potential risk in pitched roofs.",
      "But homeowners like Gary Wright feel like they have been \"left in limbo\".",
      "When his two-year fixed-rate mortgage was up for renewal, he hoped to find a better rate.",
      "But when he applied he was shocked to discover open cell spray foam had been installed in 2009. It had not come up during surveys when he had bought the house.",
      "He decided to remove most of the foam in the loft himself, after receiving several expensive quotes.",
      "A surveyor still recommended a full roof report and Mr Wright felt he had to renew his mortgage with his current lender at a less preferable rate.",
      "\"We know that in the next two years, we need to get this fixed, and I can\u2019t afford to right now,\" he said.",
      "\"This phrase 'spray foam' has created fear [among lenders] based on a lack of knowledge,\" Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, told the BBC.",
      "He suggested \"hares were set running\" by previous industry guidance that has since been withdrawn.",
      "\"Insulating is a very good thing,\" he said, adding: \"But as with any building work, it needs to be done correctly\".",
      "He said the organisation was also concerned about unregulated companies targeting older, potentially vulnerable, homeowners pushing them to pay for an overpriced removal service during cold calls.",

    "title": "Who wins when Nigeria's richest man takes on the 'oil mafia'?",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:30:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Having built a $20bn oil refinery, Aliko Dangote is now at the heart of a row in the murky industry.",
    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

      "Heart With Smart (HWS) - which operates all 140 UK dine-in Pizza Hut restaurants - will use the money on new technology including touch-screen ordering kiosks and contactless table ordering.",
      "The new features would allow restaurants to save money by operating with fewer staff and are already being trialled successfully in some Pizza Hut outlets, a company insider told the BBC.",

      "Mr Toplass said it was unrealistic to expect people to be able to provide the kind of photographic evidence wanted.",
      "\"You are on your own,\" he said.",

      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, there is going to be a shortage in uranium, and that will subsequently impact power prices,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "The romcom king returns with a Christmas movie but this time it's an animation.",
    "story": [
      "As we hurtle towards Mariah Carey's most lucrative holiday, families all over the UK will be pressing play on Christmas films such as Love Actually to get themselves into the festive spirit.",
      "The 2003 movie was one of a string of hits from writer-director Richard Curtis which dominated the box office at the turn of the millennium, alongside Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary and Four Weddings and a Funeral.",
      "Curtis is returning to the Christmas theme for his latest film, but this time around he has moved away from the traditional romcom and taken on his first animated project.",
      "\"The thing for me is, it's been a long time since I was, as it were, on the dating market,\" he tells BBC News. \"But I've been a dad for the last 25 years, so it was a real joy for me to be able to write about kids.\"",
      "The film-maker has described working on animation as \"a huge treat and revelation for me\", adding that the \"whole process is so different from the other movies I\u2019ve worked on\".",
      "That Christmas, released on Netflix on 4 December, is adapted from the book of short stories Curtis published in 2021.",
      "Set in the fictional coastal town of Wellington-on-Sea, the film follows a handful of families gearing up for Christmas Day. When a blizzard hits the town and leaves the parents separated from the children, their carefully planned celebrations are thrown into chaos.",
      "The theme of Christmas gone wrong was highly relatable to Swiss director Simon Otto, who has previously worked as an animator on How to Train Your Dragon and Enchanted.",
      "\"I know from my own family growing up, we had such a clear idea of the timeline of how Christmas or any tradition will unfold,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"And I can count more times where it didn't happen the way you expect and somehow something got messed up.",
      "\"We all have a Christmas memory where something goes wrong, those are the Christmases you remember the most, and at the end of that experience you always feel like, 'My god, we were able to be together for this time, and the realisation that that's what it's really all about.\"",
      "He adds: \"I thought there was a beautiful poetry in that which we really wanted to bring out in the film, and make it as familiar to people as we can, but also contemporary and real.\"",
      "The 90-minute film features the voices of Curtis regulars such as Bill Nighy, alongside Fiona Shaw, Jodie Whittaker, Lolly Adefope and Brian Cox as Santa Claus.",
      "That Christmas premiered at the London Film Festival in October, where it received broadly positive reviews from critics.",
      "\"It can be easy to sneer at the arrival of a new Christmas movie,\" noted the Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye.",
      "\"Genuine holiday cheer is tough to conjure and, if you\u2019re not the intended audience for Hallmark-type saccharinity, the festive fare likely inspires more exasperation than joy.",
      "\"But this one slyly avoids the usual mawkishness by grounding its whimsical story in the real and prickly emotions of life.\"",
      "Next Best Picture's Philip Bagnall suggested the film is \"engineered to keep the kids busy around 4pm on Christmas Day while mum and dad sip their third Irish coffee in peace\".",
      "\"This is unlikely to become a festive classic,\" cautioned Screen Daily's Wendy Ide. \"But the message is a persuasive one: that Christmas comes in many shapes and forms and, ultimately, the only holiday tradition that is non-negotiable is goodwill to all.\"",
      "The film sees the children of the town left to fend for themselves, providing an opportunity to design the kind of Christmas Day they dreamed of, rather than the one planned by their parents which observed various family traditions.",
      "In one scene, the kids attempt to watch a Christmas film as their parents had suggested, but they get so bored they turn it off within moments. In a cheeky twist, the film they dismiss is Curtis's own Love Actually.",
      "Otto says he planted this joke in the movie without Curtis knowing. When the writer finally saw it, he jokes he found it \"very hurtful\".",
      "\"No, not really,\" he laughs. \"It reminded me of course that, when you say 'boring old Christmas movie', I think of Miracle on 34th Street or whatever, but when you say it to a young person, they say Love Actually. It was 20 years ago!\"",
      "One of the film's central questions is whether families should stick to traditions or be open to new experiences.",
      "\"The truth is that it shouldn't be all traditions nor a complete reinvention,\" Otto reflects, \"because some traditions are there for a reason, and we love them. We talk about Santa to our kids for a reason, because there's something magical.\"",
      "One striking thing about the film is how contemporary and diverse it feels. Curtis's earlier films were made in a different era, and he has said in recent years his approach to casting would be different today.",
      "But That Christmas does its best to make up for lost ground. As Ide noted in her review, the film \"unfolds in a fictional Suffolk seaside town... but the wide mix of accents and ethnicities suggests that the filmmakers have tried to cram the whole of Great Britain into this single tiny village\".",
      "It's not only the mixed-race family at the centre of the film which make it feel of the times. The children in the movie are concerned about climate change, and one has chronic anxiety.",
      "There are lighter modern flourishes too - the father in one family christens his van Beyonc\u00e9, smartphones play a big part in the plot, and the soundtrack features Dua Lipa and Ed Sheeran.",
      "Curtis acknowledges the conscious effort to make the film feel current. \"I started my career on a show called Not The Nine O'Clock News,\" he recalls, \"which was contemporary sketches, and I think always in my films I've tried to write jokes that make me laugh now, rather than traditional jokes.",
      "\"And the thing about being a parent is you spend most of your life in the real world of your kids, so I love the fact that it does feel modern, because life as it comes at you these days just is modern.\"",
      "Otto picks up: \"It felt true to me. If you take a snapshot of who lives [in the UK], it varies from region to region of course, but it's such a diverse, interesting, eclectic mix of people.",
      "\"It feels to me like that's the world we live in, and certainly we didn't want to create a world we lived in 10 years ago. If anything, we wanted to create a world we might live in 10 years from now, so more forward looking.\"",
      "The film is being released in a healthy year for animation, with The Wild Robot, Inside Out 2 and Flow among those competing in this year's awards race.",
      "But there is still a certain snobbery towards animated films, and only three have ever scored a best picture nomination - Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story 3 and Up.",
      "Director Guillermo del Toro has previously championed it as its own craft, commenting: \"Animation is not a genre for kids. It's a medium for art.\"",
      "Curtis agrees: \"I feel quite strongly about that at this moment, because for me, the two Spider-Verse movies are the most remarkable movies of the last 10 years.",
      "\"I watch them and I think, 'they must have taken 300 years to make, they're so extraordinary'. In the same way it's turned out that much pop music, which used to be looked down on, is really great, I think every genre can be great, and there are some amazing works of art in the world of animation.\"",

      "The exhibition will aim to take visitors on a 120-year journey through the evolution of science at the royal court, the Palace of Versailles, and explain how monarchs Louis XIV, Louis XV and Louis XVI encouraged scientific pursuit and drew on technological advances to enhance France's prestige and extend its influence.",

      "In the documentary, Martin-Smith said Williams had made him out to be \"evil\" and had blamed him for some of his behaviour, including his drug-taking.",

      "\"Some are fortunate through a series of self-examinations and help to overcome their experience. Some never quite manage to untangle the mess of the wreckage of the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not breaking anyone\u2019s anonymity by sharing the side effects of boyband dysphoria that relate to just us lads.\"",

      "He went on to urge Martin-Smith to take accountability and to \"admit your shortcomings\".",
      "The documentary, which reaches its conclusion this week, focuses on some of the biggest boybands to grace the charts during the 1990s and early 2000s."

    "story": [
      "Netflix says 60 million households worldwide tuned in live to see Mike Tyson take on Jake Paul, in the streaming giant's first foray into live boxing.",
      "The event, which was free for subscribers, is being hailed by the tech giant as a \"record breaking night\".",
      "However, fans hoping to watch have expressed their anger and disappointment after some reported Netflix crashed repeatedly throughout the fight.",
      "But there was also criticism from those who were able to tune in, with many saying they found the boxing match lacklustre.",
      "In the bout, which took place at the AT&T Stadium in Texas, former world heavyweight champion Tyson, 58, was beaten by YouTuber-turned-fighter Paul, 27.",
      "The fight attracted a huge amount of media coverage. Tyson is one of the most famous boxers on the planet, while Paul drew in a younger audience.",
      "There was a star-studded ringside audience including Charlize Theron, Ralph Macchio, Joe Jonas and Hasan Minhaj.",
      "Paul says 120 million viewers watched it live globally on Netflix, while the tech firm later stated \"60 million households\" around the world tuned in. It said it will reveal further viewing figures early next week.",
      "But some viewers reported experiencing buffering issues on the site, and some said they simply couldn't get onto it.",
      "The fight was \"unwatchable,\" wrote one X user. Another said she was \"furious\", while a third complained he \"did an all-nighter for nothing\".",
      "Netflix declined to comment on the technical glitches.",
      "Brendan Ashford, who lives in Devon, told BBC News he stayed up late to watch the fight, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning UK time.",
      "\"I was interested to see how Mike Tyson, at 58, would perform against a much younger guy,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not in the habit of staying up late, but I thought it was worth it.\"",
      "He tried signing in on Netflix at around 04:00 GMT, and says initially it loaded 25%, and then it got to 75%, but after that it got stuck.",
      "\"I knew I had a good connection, so then I looked on social media and saw others were also experiencing issues,\" he said.",
      "\"It was really disappointing. I kept trying for a good hour before I gave up.\"",
      "Mr Ashford said it made him wonder how Netflix would fare with future live sports events, given the problems people encountered this time.",
      "\"It can't be good for their reputation,\" he said.",
      "On social media, there was a similar reaction from fans, who vented their frustrations.",
      "Many also posted pictures and videos of the fight failing to load, while some said the service failed at the key moments during the event.",
      "\"Had all my friends over to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight. Not loading,\" wrote one X user.",
      "\"Shame on Netflix for not being able to handle the streaming of the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight,\" wrote another.",
      "\"The lagging is so bad the fights are unwatchable to long time subscribers like me and other people I know at home with friends, family, snacks, and drinks but no fights.\"",
      "Another person simply asked, \"did Netflix not have enough time to prepare for the Tyson / Paul fight?\"",
      "'It needs to get this fixed'",
      "This isn't the first time Netflix has had issues with live streaming.",
      "Last year, it apologised after a much-publicised livestream of its hit dating show, the Love is Blind reunion, was delayed due to a glitch.",
      "The technical reason for the delay was unclear but the streaming giant said it was \"incredibly sorry\".",
      "No reason has been given for these latest issues, but Chris Stokel-Walker, a tech reporter, said that the huge demand to watch the fight was \"Netflix's undoing\".",
      "\"Netflix has done live broadcasting before,\" he said.",
      "\"What's different, was that this fight was so hyped.",
      "\"There were so many viewers that were wanting to watch this, given the personalities involved - Jake Paul with his huge following, Mike Tyson returning to the ring for the first time in decades.",
      "\"Even people who aren't major boxing fans wanted to tune in because of all the coverage.",
      "\"As a result, there was additional demand well above and beyond your average live event, like a comedy special, or the live golf tournament they previously broadcast.\"",
      "Mr Stokel-Walker said that with Netflix intending to move towards more live sports in future, including a new deal with WWE from next year, it \"needs to get this fixed\".",
      "\"They have to expect that if they're going to get into this world, they're going to have to get used to this volume of people coming,\" he said.",
      "\"The Tyson vs Paul fight was one of the most high profile examples of an event they\u2019ve done live, so it's really not ideal.",

    "title": "Silent Men film asks why so many still struggle to open up",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:59:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Scottish filmmaker Duncan Cowles set out to ask why men tend to bottle up their emotions.",
    "story": [
      "Male mental health is back in the spotlight ahead of International Men's Day on Tuesday (19 November). The subject has received much more prominence in the last decade - something many would argue is long overdue.",
      "But while the high rates of male suicide have put the topic firmly on the national agenda - huge numbers of men still find it difficult to be openly vulnerable and discuss their feelings.",
      "With suicide the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK, a new film explores why many men still bottle up their emotions, and asks whether such ingrained, systemic behaviour can be changed.",
      "Duncan Cowles, who directs Silent Men, is the first to admit his own struggles to open up emotionally to those closest to him, joking that tackling the subject for the documentary was \"like dragging myself backwards through a hedge\".",
      "Speaking at the Sheffield Documentary Festival earlier this year, he told BBC News it was an important journey to go on because the risks of ignoring your emotions are far scarier.",
      "\"I think there's still a lot of societal pressure around those traditional masculine traits,\" Cowles says. \"Being strong and things associated with being a leader or this stable, reliable, dependable figure.",
      "\"There's maybe something still seductive about that idea of that old-fashioned man, that James Bond character that a lot of us maybe grew up with. I think it's still quite sought-after by a lot of people.",
      "\"Whereas my experience is when you're a bit more open and vulnerable, that can actually lead to stronger relationships, and therefore more joy, connection and fulfilment. And yet still we're drawn to being closed off.\"",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "The idea of men suffering in silence is nothing new. It was 1854 when Henry David Thoreau wrote: \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"",
      "The fact that the essayist's most famous observation has survived for 170 years and is still quoted so widely today is a testament to its relatability - but also of how little progress has been made.",
      "Thoreau tapped into a feeling many men have, both then and now, of being unfulfilled - whether that's in their career, relationships or for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.",
      "Overwhelmed by the commitments or mundanity of day-to-day life, while simultaneously unwilling or unable to voice their emotions, men often find it hard to cope.",
      "Blue blanket theory",
      "\"I suppose it's always been something I've struggled with, opening up and showing emotions around family,\" Cowles says of his reasons for making the film.",
      "\"While I was at university, I'd done a little film which investigated that, but it always felt like this thing that I hadn't fully resolved in my life.\"",
      "Setting out to explore the subject further at the start of the film, Cowles posts an advert online, looking for men to speak to for the documentary. He then goes to interview some of those who reply.",
      "He travels around the country and speaks to men from different walks of life over several years. At one point, he attends a retreat where men gather for a weekend to do group therapy.",
      "\"I wanted to go on my own journey, parallel to speaking to men as part of the film. But it turned into a more personal film than I expected,\" he explains.",
      "The Scottish filmmaker interviews members of his own family and studies how their personalities shaped his own. \"My dad likes drilling holes in the wall, and his stamps, but he's not big on verbal communication,\" Cowles notes early on - painting a picture of fathers many will recognise.",
      "One trauma specialist interviewed for the film cites a study which found that babies in blue blankets - and therefore assumed to be boys - were touched for significantly less time than girls.",
      "\"So that's really interesting, what are we doing in our culture about socialising boys to not be touched as much, not be seen as vulnerable, not need emotional support as much as girls?\" she asks.",
      "\"The toughening up - 'be a brave boy, big boys don't cry' - that process of making you into a man, where someone has told you that that's what a man is, that a man has got to be emotionally strong.",
      "\"There are all these social constructs that kind of trap you, which is causing huge numbers of mental health issues for guys. We've got a big problem on our hands.\"",
      "Silent Men is Cowles' first feature documentary, but he previously won a Bafta Scotland award for his short film Isabella.",
      "Asked if it was difficult to get the men featured in the film to talk about their feelings, Cowles replies: \"Strangely not, because there's something about speaking to a stranger that can sometimes feel a lot easier than speaking to someone who's in your own family. I guess it's because you've less to lose.\"",
      "The insights from other men make for interesting viewing. One contributor, Ainslie, says his outlook changed after having a baby. But not necessarily in the way you might think - he says the responsibility of being a father actually meant there was less time and opportunity to find room for expressing his own emotions.",
      "Another man, Dom, tells his young son constantly how much he loves him, and says he hated the thought of anybody close to him dying without knowing how much they meant to him.",
      "One of the film's most affecting - and funniest - moments comes when the microphone Cowles' brother is using cuts out after the battery dies, and he uses that exact moment, when he can't fully be heard, to tell Duncan: \"I love you.\"",
      "Despite all the heavy talk, the film is peppered with moments of levity - the director occasionally cuts away abruptly from tough conversations to run footage of soothing shorelines and bumble bees on flowers.",
      "\"One thing I really wanted to do with this film is make it feel accessible, not all mental health based, but [to] also contain humour and leave people with a smile on their face,\" he says.",
      "The documentary builds towards a conclusion as Cowles sits down with his parents to tell them he loves them.",
      "While both are receptive, his father is somewhat dismissive of the \"airy-fairy\" nature of showing emotions, suggesting it's \"not a normal thing for a man\".",
      "Therefore, his father argues, if somebody isn't opening up, that's actually a good sign, as not feeling the need to be vulnerable means they are generally feeling content.",
      "Reflecting on his father's comments now, Cowles says: \"He comes from a generation where he doesn't want to see someone visibly upset, so if you're showing nothing, then that's a good thing [to him] because it means you're OK. I know what he means.",
      "\"Younger people seem to have a different opinion on these kinds of things, and they are more willing to open up,\" he notes. \"There's that awareness of the issue.\"",
      "Cowles admits on camera his worry that he will pretend to have made progress for the purposes of giving the film a happy ending, when in reality there may not have been any significant change.",
      "But several months after filming wrapped, Cowles says making the film \"definitely has\" altered his behaviour.",
      "\"I wouldn't say it's a Hollywood transformation,\" he laughs. \"It's been quite a gradual thing, and I wouldn't say I'm perfect by any means.",
      "\"But compared to what I was like before, my partner is very appreciative that I've changed, that I'm more conscious of it and able to recognise when I should open up a bit more.\"",
      "Silent Men is screened at Sheffield DocFest in June and is released in UK cinemas on 19 November."

      "\"I was there at the time Dune was released, so people kept asking me in shops and restaurants if I was Timoth\u00e9e on a press tour.\"",

      "\"It was also just something a bit different and wacky that I wanted to be part of.\"",
      "The event took social media by storm, with one person commenting on X it was \"a historic pop culture moment\", while another said the competition \"shows that the people yearn for weird town events\".",
      "Although the real Timoth\u00e9e turned up and took pictures with some of the lookalikes, Miles didn't get a chance to meet the American actor.",
      "\"He arrived at the same time the police did to shut down the event so I had already moved to the secondary location for the event. I'm gutted I didn't get to meet him.\"",

      "Oscar, who says he once missed his train because an insistent fan made him sign an autograph, adds: \"People want to think there's a deeper meaning to these events, but really we're all just bored millennials and Gen Z looking for something to do.\"",

      "Journalist Katrina Mirpuri says she organised the lookalike contest because \"people need to have some fun after all the dreary news we're having\".",
      "Despite worrying that \"no-one would turn up\", she says half of Soho Square was packed with lookalikes and fans.",
      "Even though most of the contestants didn't quite look like Harry, \"the girls were screaming for each man as they got up to twirl, so they were doing something right\".",
      "\"Really it wasn't about who looked most like Harry,\" Katrina explains. \"It was a way for people to just be positive and celebratory about each other, which is what we need when everyone is so nasty and negative on social media.\"",
      "She has now got her eye on hosting another competition but this time \"for someone older, like Hugh Grant\".",
      "'I made new friends at the contest'",

      "The 25-year-old says looking like the Slumdog Millionaire actor has \"given him a glimpse of what it's like to be a celebrity\".",

      "Julyus, from Venezuela, says his friends think he looks so much like Zayn that \"people don't even call me by my real name any more\".",
      "The resemblance to the former One Direction star means he often gets \"stopped by groups of girls on the subway or the street\".",

      "She falls through a rack of dresses and finds herself in a fantastical world, where she revisits moments in her life - from childhood through to teenage years and adulthood.",
      "There are no recognisable celebrities in the advert, something Charlotte Lock, customer director at John Lewis, told the BBC was deliberate.",
      "\"We get contacted every year by A-listers who want to be in our ad,\" she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "READ NEXT: Glastonbury 2025 tickets go on sale",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",
      "This year, Glastonbury tickets cost \u00a3375.50 each plus a \u00a35 booking fee - but at the check-out you will only pay a deposit of \u00a375, with the balance due in the first week of April. (Children aged 12 and under go free, and do not need to be registered.)",
      "Make sure you have enough money in your account (\u00a3450 if you're buying for six people) and, crucially, keep your card details to hand.",
      "When the time comes, enter these details exactly as you see them because a mistake could result in the purchase being declined. In some cases, that could leave your registration details being frozen for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Finally, make sure your phone is charged and notifications aren't silenced, in case your bank contacts you for verification.",
      "9) Check your email",
      "Once you've made the booking, be sure to check your email for confirmation - including the junk folder.",
      "If you don't receive an email within three hours, ticket-holders are urged to contact See Tickets on their customer service portal.",
      "10) Don't despair",
      "If you're not one of the lucky ones, there's still hope.",
      "It's possible to get into the festival as a volunteer - typically working three eight-hour shifts in return for a ticket.",
      "And in April, a number of returned or unwanted tickets will be put up for sale. At which point, you can go through the stress of applying all over again.",
      "11) Indulge in wild speculation about the line-up",
      "This won't help you get tickets, but is an essential part of the annual routine.",
      "Nobody except Emily Eavis knows who'll be headlining next year - but rumours are rumours, and everybody enjoys speculating about the line-up.",
      "Oasis, whose reunion tour takes place next summer, have already ruled themselves out. But current contenders for the top slots include Sam Fender, who put on an incredible Pyramid Stage performance two years ago; and Olivia Rodrigo, who's already headlining the BST Festival in London on Glastonbury weekend.",
      "Eminem and Rihanna are among the perennial will-they/won't-they headliners, while Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder are supposedly in the running for the legend slot.",
      "In previous years, piecemeal confirmation of the line-up has started in November, but the full rundown is typically kept under wraps until March.",

    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",

      "\"I was too young to leave home legally. If I'd have left, they'd have dragged me back.\"",
      "He said he \"didn't want to put his mum and dad through that\" and realised he had to \"try and make the best of a situation\" and that is what he did.",
      "In his new memoir, Boy from the Valleys: My Unexpected Journey, Evans describes how he was bullied at school because of his religion and sexuality and had a \"horrible time\".",
      "\"I was the perfect target, I was a Jehovah's Witness, I was a very quiet kid, I was an only child. I didn't have the ability to fight back.",
      "\"When you're that young and you have to think about why they're calling you things, terrible word... a kid should never have to think, what's wrong with me? Why is it me they're picking on? Because bullies can be brutal.\"",
      "He said Jehovah's Witnesses were very peaceful.",
      "\"They're a very pacifist society. They don't fight, they don't argue, so I wasn't really prepared for these big bullies in school. But I just got through it.\"",
      "His religion meant that for a long time, he was unable to perform in any school shows.",
      "\"I didn't do any of that as a Jehovah's Witness.",
      "\"For many years, I wasn't allowed to be in the choir because they sang religious songs. I couldn't be in any Christmas shows because we didn't celebrate Christmas. There was no harvest festival... no Easter.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 09:10:45 GMT",
    "summary": "The singer and actress stars in Emilia P\u00e9rez, a new Netflix musical which has been tipped for awards.",
    "story": [
      "When Emilia P\u00e9rez premiered earlier this year, it became one of the breakout hits of the Cannes Film Festival, where its four lead stars jointly won best actress.",
      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:58:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Around 630,000 women are waiting for gynaecology appointments as waiting lists double in four years.",
    "story": [
      "Waiting lists for gynaecology appointments across the UK have more than doubled since February 2020, BBC research reveals.",
      "Records show around three-quarters of a million (755,046) women's health appointments are waiting to happen - up from 360,400 just before the pandemic.",
      "This would suggest around 630,000 people - at the very least - are on the list to be seen for problems that range from fibroids and endometriosis to incontinence and menopause care.",
      "Health ministers across the UK say they are working on plans to improve the situation, but health leaders say that women are being let down.",
      "'The illness controls my whole life'",
      "Anna Cooper, 31, from near Wrexham in North Wales, has had severe endometriosis since her teens.",
      "The condition - where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside it  - has  left her with permanent organ damage.",
      "She has had to have 17 operations, including a hysterectomy to remove her womb.",
      "She also has two stomas in place for life because much of her bladder and bowel have had to be removed. She lives with her partner and young daughter.",
      "\"The disease controls my social life, my work life and my ability to function every day.",
      "\"It is not just a period problem - it is a whole body problem. It ripples through your body,\" she says.",
      "The BBC spoke to her in 2023 about setting up her own charity, Menstrual Health Project.",
      "A year on, she says she is still in pain and is on the NHS waiting list yet again because she has experienced bleeding after her hysterectomy.",
      "Anna wears a morphine patch to help deal with pain every day.",
      "But for years, she says medics did not listen to her, and told her the pain was \"in her head\" and that she had to \"just get used to it\".",
      "She feels getting a diagnosis sooner would have changed her life: \"The delay in my care has cost me some of my major organs.",
      "\"Doctors have told me that if they'd caught it sooner, I wouldn't have ended up the way I am, living with two stomas and being in early menopause at the age of 31.\"",
      "In the last three years she made the decision to spend \u00a325,000 on private operations, borrowing money to help.",
      "She counts herself lucky to get private care but feels she was \"almost left with no choice\" because the waiting lists are so long: \"I can be a mum who isn't just in her bed constantly because she is crippled with pain.\"",
      "Endometriosis has \"mentally tormented\" her for the most of her adult life.",
      "\"It is really difficult dealing with a condition where I look absolutely fine from the outside, but internally, I'm just in despair.\"",
      "'Lack of priority'",
      "\"Women are being let down\" and change is \"urgently needed,\" says Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).",
      "The college's new report looks at the impact on people waiting for care.",
      "\"Gynaecology is the only elective speciality that solely treats women and has one of the worst waiting lists across the UK.",
      "\"This reflects the persistent lack of priority given to women and women\u2019s health, \" Dr Thakar says.",
      "\"Women are suffering. We know it is affecting their mental health. They are not able to go to work, they are not able to socialize.\"",
      "Dr Thakar adds that if the women had been treated earlier, their conditions wouldn't have progressed as much, and they would continue to contribute to society.",
      "A recent report led by the NHS Confederation suggests being absent from work because of heavy periods, endometriosis, fibroids and ovarian cysts costs the UK economy nearly \u00a311 billion each year.",
      "The RCOG is calling for governments to commit more long-term funding, to ensure people get the help they need.",
      "There are some signs that waiting lists are starting to improve.",
      "Waits have not been rising as steeply this year and NHS England's latest figures show there has been a drop in numbers on the waiting list of over 4,700 compared to the month before.",
      "But the situation is still much worse than pre-pandemic. In Feb 2020 there were 66 gynaecology  waits of more than a year. Now there are more than 22,000.",
      "Women on gynae waiting lists 'feel abandoned'",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS England's national clinical director for women\u2019s health, acknowledged  some women wait too long for crucial gynaecology appointments, despite staff working hard to see more patients.",
      "She says one way of helping is specialist teams working outside of hospitals.",
      "\u201cSome of these conditions can be managed very well by specialist healthcare teams in the community, which is why we are expanding neighbourhood women\u2019s health hubs in every local care system across the country.\"",
      "In Wales, the government plans to publish a women's health plan next month.",
      "\u201cA 10-year Women\u2019s Health Plan is being developed to drive the improvement needed to provide good quality health services to women throughout their lifetime,\"  a Welsh Government spokesperson said.",
      "Regions in Northern Ireland are working on plans to improve gynaecology services, taking on the 20 recommendations made in a recent report.",
      "The department of health says some will require \"additional funding and lead-in time.\"",
      "Scotland's Women\u2019s Health Minister Jenni Minto said excessively long waits were not acceptable and more money was going towards women's health.",
      "\"That is why one of the initial priorities of the women\u2019s health plan is to improve access for women to appropriate support, diagnosis and treatment.\"",
      "Anna Cooper is hoping ministers \"follow through with their words\".",
      "When governments say they are going to prioritize women's health, then they need to show they are doing just that, she says.",
      "\"Currently they are not showing it, and this is people's lives we are rolling the dice on... And having a daughter, I really fear for young girls' and women's futures.\"",
      "How we arrived at the figures",
      "To estimate the size of the gynaecology waiting list for the UK we added together the most recent figures available for all four nations, as tracked by the RCOG.",
      "This includes waits for gynaecology appointments and planned procedures and excludes urgent appointments for things like suspected cancer.",
      "It tells you how big the waiting list is, but some patients may need more than one appointment.",
      "Our estimate for the number of people waiting is at least 634,239  - and it  could be considerably more.",
      "We worked this out by looking at data from the NHS in England that suggests across waiting lists there is around a 16% difference between the number of appointments and people waiting.",
      "We have applied this to the gynaecology waiting list.",
      "It could underestimate the size of the problem, as gynaecology patients are less likely to be waiting for two appointments than patients in some other specialities.",

    "story": [
      "A senior coroner has warned that more babies could die unless \"action is taken\", following the deaths of three infants who had received contaminated feed while being cared for in hospital.",
      "Three-month-old Aviva Otte died in January 2014 after being given contaminated feed at St Thomas' Hospital, south London.",
      "In June that year, one-month-old Oscar Barker and nine-day-old Yousef Al-Kharboush died after a similar, but separate contamination incident.",
      "Following an inquest, Dr Julian Morris said he was concerned that St Thomas' Hospital was not legally required to report the first incident and called for a change in the law.",
      "All three babies, who had been born prematurely, were fed through an intravenous drip, a method known as \"total parenteral nutrition\" (TPN).",
      "Aviva, the first child to die, was given TPN that was made by NHS pharmacists at St Thomas' Hospital.",
      "Oscar, who died at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge and Yousef, who also died at St Thomas' Hospital, received feed manufactured by private company ITH Pharma which supplied to several trusts.",

      "Inquest into contaminated baby feed deaths opens",
      "Company admits supplying contaminated baby feed",
      "Charges over baby feed 'contamination'",
      "In his conclusion, the senior coroner for Inner South London said he was worried that a lack of regulation around medicines such as Aviva's feed might lead to future deaths.",
      "Aviva's TPN was made in St Thomas' hospital's pharmacy - which is known as a \"Section 10\" setting. Hospital pharmacists will typically make bespoke medicines for highly dependent patients with niche needs.",
      "Such medicines are not subject to the same regulatory process as those produced by private manufacturers. This means that any problems with them do not need to be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or to other trusts.",
      "Dr Morris said this concerned him, as it meant the \"industry in general\" was not being warned of any \"adverse\" issues with these medicines.",
      "'Hospital did not pass on findings'",
      "In a letter to Health Secretary Wes Streeting he wrote: \"In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.\"",
      "He also said that although issues must be reported to the NHS and the healthcare regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC), \"the threshold or necessity for such reporting appears unclear and, in essence, up to the trust\".",
      "He added: \"There may be times when section 10 entities reach conclusions which would assist the wider industry and help to assist both other trusts and commercial organisations.\"",
      "Dr Morris also highlighted that Bacillus cereus is resistant to some cleaning methods and that sporicides - disinfectants that kill microbial spores - can be required to achieve decontamination.",
      "He said St Thomas' Hospital knew this prior to the outbreak later that year but did not pass on its findings.",
      "ITH Pharma was fined \u00a31.2m by a crown court in 2022 after providing TPN from which 19 premature babies became infected across nine hospitals in 2014, including Oscar and Yousef.",
      "The company pleaded guilty to a number of regulatory offences in 2022.",
      "A spokesperson said the company welcomed the coroner's recommendations and it \"recognised the importance of sharing information and learning\" across the industry.",
      "\"Any information that had been shared with ITH and the MHRA as a result of a previous outbreak in the NHS five months prior to the ITH incident could have been of real value in taking steps to prevent future possible incidents.\"",
      "Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust said following Aviva's death, it ceased TPN production and began to outsource it.",
      "Dr Sara Hanna, a medical director at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, said it extended its \"deepest condolences\" to the families of Aviva and Yousef.",
      "\"We are considering the coroner\u2019s findings carefully and continue to ensure we are doing everything possible to provide the very highest quality of care for all of our patients, but particularly for our most vulnerable patients,\" Dr Hanna added.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:02:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The new measures aim to stop private care home providers benefiting excessively from a stretched system.",
    "story": [
      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",
      "Annie Hudson, the panel's chair, said the new legislation would \"go some way towards tackling some of the systemic weaknesses that can create the conditions where very vulnerable children are abused and neglected\".",

      "Strengthening the rights of families to be involved in decisions about a child going into careRequiring every council to have multi-agency child safeguarding teamsRequiring local authorities to offer support for care leavers, including helping them find accommodation, until the age of 21Compelling families with a child who has had a protection inquiry or protection plan for them to have council permission to home-school them",

      "These court orders allow children to be locked up - in registered or unregistered homes - and are often granted for children who are a risk to themselves or others. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children\u2019s commissioner, says far fewer should be granted.",
      "Responding to the government's plans, the Children's Home Association (CHA), which represents providers in England and Wales, said the new Ofsted powers that will \"tackle unregistered and unregulated illegal residential provision is long overdue\".",
      "However, it argued the \"backstop\" law that threatens to cap providers' profits \"risks serious unintended consequences\" as it would \"incentivise more providers to adopt offshore interest and debt-driven business models\".",
      "The CHA also criticised Phillipson's comment that the sector was letting families down, saying it was \"not involved with families or their decisions\" and took in children \"because social work and preventative measures fail, likely due to local authorities' lack of financial resources\".",
      "Paul Carberry, chief executive of charity Action for Children, welcomed the government's plan, but said that \"urgent investment in not-for-profit and public sector provision is required to create stability and make sure every child gets the placement they need\".",

      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",
      "In addition, the NHS recommends women who are trying for a baby take folic acid supplements for approximately three months before getting pregnant, and for at least 12 weeks after becoming pregnant. This recommendation will remain in place.",

      "The prime minister said he understood farmers' concerns and \"wants to support\" them but added \"the vast majority\" would be unaffected.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will be liable to the tax at 20% - half the usual inheritance tax rate.",
      "Other allowances could mean a couple who are married or in a civil partnership could pass on a farm worth as much as \u00a33m.",

      "The farming tax row explained",
      "How many farms would be affected by Budget changes?",
      "However, many farmers argue that while they are asset rich - for example in terms of their land and livestock - they are cash poor and the changes would mean they would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "Ahead of the protest, around 1,800 National Farmers' Union (NFU) members met near Parliament as part of a mass lobby of MPs.",
      "The group's president, Tom Bradshaw, gave an impassioned speech describing the tax changes as destructive, a \"stab in the back\" for farmers, wrong and unacceptable.",
      "He told protesters the changes were the \"straw that broke the camel's back\".",
      "Later, speaking to Sky News, he said Labour had \"destroyed\" a \"contract\" between farming and the government dating back to World War Two.",
      "\"We'd love to pay more tax,\" Mr Bradshaw added.",
      "\"If we get proper margins from food production, and we end up swelling the Treasury coffers, bring it on.",
      "\"But at the moment the supply chain doesn't give us those returns that enables us to save the money to pay the inheritance tax that this government now wants to take.\"",
      "He added that Environment Secretary Steve Reed said when he was in opposition that Labour would not change agricultural property relief.",
      "Since 2019, pig farming costs have risen by 54%, cattle by 44% and cereal by 43%, as food, fuel and fertiliser prices increase at a rate far outstripping the increases farmers can charge on what they produce. Subsidies that farmers get have also been declining since Brexit.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300 - although that figure may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "The number of the UK's 210,000 farms that could be affected by the inheritance tax change is also disputed.",
      "The government says it will affect the wealthiest 500 estates each year, but the NFU and the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) have estimated up to 70,000 farms worth more than \u00a31m could be affected.",
      "According to BBC Verify, the largest estimate relates to the total number that could ever be affected. But the number of farms likely to be impacted each year is set to be around 500.",
      "Between 2021 and 2022, 117 farms with a value of more than \u00a32.5m were inherited.",
      "Reed told the Commons Rural Affairs Committee on Tuesday that many farmers protesting over the tax changes were \"wrong\" about the policy - and he rejected claims the government had underestimated how many people would be affected.",
      "\"Many of them, probably happily, are wrong because there are things that they can do to plan their tax affairs as most businesses or asset owners would do to limit their liability,\" he said.",
      "He said: \"The numbers I've heard bandied around are enormous and very, very frightening if people were to believe them.\"",
      "He acknowledged the changes would be \"unsettling\" and said he was \"listening\" to concerns, but insisted that most farmers would not face a hike.",
      "Among those attending Tuesday's events was Gloucestershire livestock farmer David Barton, who estimates his 400-cattle business - which has been in the family since 1913 - is worth around \u00a35m.",
      "Mr Barton is worried the proposed changes to inheritance tax could see his son facing a \u00a3800,000 bill and said the Budget \"has just ripped the heart out of us\".",
      "He is now considering gifting his estate, which he believes would fall outside of inheritance tax if he does not die within seven years, but feared he was not in a financial position to stop working.",
      "Others at the protest said they would have to sell their farms to pay the tax bills.",
      "Jen, a seventh-generation farmer from Yorkshire, who did not give her surname, told the PA news agency: \"If the Budget goes through, then that means I won't be able to take her over my family farm because between me and my brother, we would have to sell up to be able to pay the tax.",
      "\"It's something we've both been passionate about from when we were little kids, ever since we could walk, always been involved - it's a lifestyle.\"",
      "The 24-year-old said they would have to pay approximately \u00a31.2m.",
      "\"We have spoken to our accountant, solicitors, and once something happens to our parents - unless there is some change, unless there's something we can do - then it's not possible for us,\" she said.",
      "Jeremy Clarkson, who owns Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire - which features in the Amazon series Clarkson's Farm - said he thought the change to inheritance tax was \"a very rushed last-minute decision\".",
      "\"I think we all make mistakes in life, and I think it's time for them to say 'you know what, we've cocked this one up a bit' and back down.\"",
      "BBC Newsnight\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire asked Mr Clarkson at the protest about his motivation for attending the rally: \u201cSo, it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s not about your farm and the fact you bought a farm to avoid inheritance tax?\u201d",
      "Criticising the question as \u201cClassic BBC\", Mr Clarkson said: \"I wanted to shoot... which comes with the benefit of not having to pay inheritance tax. Now I do. But people like me will simply put it [money] in a trust.",
      "\"And so long as I live for seven years, that's fine... But it's incredibly time consuming to have to do that. And why should all these people have to do that? Why should they?\u201d",

      "Under the new rules farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value)There is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325mIf a farmer is married, their spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65mIn addition, there is an \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it's being passed on to children or grandchildren.

      "The Scottish Labour leader reiterated his stance that the Pension Credit criteria for the winter fuel payment was too low as he called for a \"Scottish solution\" to the issue.",
      "However, he stopped short of backing SNP calls for a UK government U-turn when the issue was debated at Holyrood.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Glasgow on Tuesday, Sarwar highlighted several areas where he had taken a different approach to UK Labour - citing his willingness to join striking workers on picket lines.",
      "First Minister John Swinney has been urged to find extra funding to provide universal coverage for winter fuel payments in his budget for 2025-26, which is due to be announced on 4 December.",
      "He indicated that it would cost about \u00a3190m to fund the new Holyrood-managed equivalent, the Pension Age Winter Heating Assistance.",
      "Swinney said the government was considering its budget plans, adding: \u201cBut the shortcut to sorting out this issue \u2013 this issue which is the making of the Labour government in Westminster \u2013 is for Anas Sarwar to demand that the Labour prime minister reverses the cut to winter fuel payments that were made by the Labour government.",
      "\u201cPeople in Scotland can\u2019t understand why a Labour government came into office and one of their first acts was to cut the winter fuel payments of pensioners.\u201d",
      "Social Justice Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville accused Labour of  \"Orwellian double-think\".",
      "She said: \"Having just cut the winter fuel payment for millions of pensioners across the UK, they now expect people to believe that they are in fact on the side of pensioners.",
      "\u201cAnas Sarwar sat on his hands while his Westminster colleagues forced through this cut, and he must explain why Labour failed to back the reintroduction of the winter fuel payment just a few weeks ago in the Scottish Parliament.\u201d",
      "'Tough' decision",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously defended his \"tough\" decision to cut winter fuel payments.",
      "He also issued a \"guarantee\" that an increase in the state pension - which is set to rise by \u00a3460 per year in April - would \"outstrip\" losses for those who will not receive the winter fuel payment, which is either \u00a3200 or \u00a3300.",
      "However, the state pension increase will be spread over the year from next April, whereas the winter fuel payment is usually paid in November or December.",
      "UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed said Scottish Labour had \"made their choice\" and it was part of devolution that there would be differences across the UK.",
      "There are a few elements at play when it comes to this announcement.",
      "For one thing, Anas Sarwar has always said he's uncomfortable with the UK Labour government's criteria around who gets a winter fuel payment. He thinks it's too restrictive.",
      "Also, after Keir Starmer's rough start upon entering Downing Street, he's perhaps made the calculation that a bit of distance between him and UK Labour is no bad thing.",
      "Indeed, in a huddle with press this morning, Sarwar was keen to stress areas where he's taken a different approach (such as joining workers on picket lines).",
      "Remember the context here: there's a Holyrood election in 2026, and Scottish Labour won't want to be associated with any UK Labour unpopularity around that time.",
      "Finally, there's a bit of a challenge to the Scottish government in all of this.",
      "As the budget approaches, there are rumblings that Scottish ministers could throw some extra cash towards pensioners.",
      "In the wake of today's announcement Anas Sarwar can claim he made the first move.",
      "But there's no denying this also comes with an element of awkwardness - as Scottish Labour are acknowledging that the UK government's policy on winter fuel payments falls short.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",

      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",

      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",

      "A BBC film, to be broadcast this Wednesday, details their battles for what the dwindling band of men believe is a hidden truth: that the UK\u2019s military knew at the time it was subjecting them to radiation that would damage them and their descendants forever.",
      "Thousands of the men have suffered cancers and other conditions that other nuclear states have recognised as probably linked to the now-banned testing.",

      "In Mr Morris\u2019s case, as the film reveals, he believes the death of his first child, Steven, in 1962, was the result of the radiation damage he suffered during Operation Grapple - the name given to a series of British nuclear weapons tests.",
      "Steven was four months old when he died in his cot. The coroner suspected the baby\u2019s lung had not properly formed. Why? Nobody knows.",

      "What was that \u201cspecial directive\u201d? Nobody knows.",
      "So was there a cover-up decades ago?",
      "A 2008 government filing, in one part of the then legal battle, shows officials assured their in-house lawyers that \u201cno individual monitoring of servicemen\u201d had taken place during the tests.",

      "The Home Office \"cut corners\" and made \"poor decisions\", while under pressure to stop housing migrants in hotels, when it paid \u00a315m for an asbestos-contaminated derelict prison, the government's spending watchdog has said.",
      "The National Audit Office (NAO) said the amount paid for the Northeye site in East Sussex in 2023 under the Conservative government was more than twice what the seller paid in 2022.",
      "A report found \"corners [were] cut\" so the site could be acquired quickly to house asylum seekers despite an assessment deeming it \"high risk\".",
      "The Home Office said the report related to the last government's actions and it remained \"committed to ending the use of hotels\".",
      "In December 2022, then-prime minister Rishi Sunak delivered a statement in Parliament in which he vowed to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, saying that the government would \"work to achieve this as quickly as possible\".",
      "In its report, the NAO said the statement \"generated significant pressure within the Home Office to identify and secure sites for asylum accommodation at pace\".",
      "It added that, the following January, a decision to acquire Northeye was taken by a small group of ministers and officials from across Whitehall, despite the \"technical due diligence and approvals process not having been undertaken\".",

      "'High risk'",

      "The following month, Jenrick announced that Northeye would be developed to house 1,200 people, and the sale was completed in September 2023.",
      "The final price paid for the site was \u00a315.4m, including \u00a30.9m paid to the vendors - Brockwell Group Bexhill LLP - because the Home Office had underestimated how long it would take to complete the purchase.",
      "Brockwell had bought Northeye in August 2022 for \u00a36.3m.",
      "The costs of remediation because of the contamination at the site were estimated to be between \u00a31.1m and \u00a33.6m.",

      "He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside.",
      "\"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming.",
      "\"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d",
      "Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union.",

      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Tax change 'is existential threat to farmers'",
      "Firstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it.",
      "The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21.",
      "Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed.",

    "title": "'Genuine impasse' at top of government about social care plan, insiders say",
    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 13:12:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Multiple sources say the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost of fixing social care, and that the PM is yet to decide how to proceed.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first five months have produced little sign of a plan for Labour\u2019s promised National Care Service \u2013 and now I\u2019m told there is a \u201cgenuine impasse\u201d at the top of government over what to do about social care.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting publicly acknowledges \u201cwe can\u2019t solve the NHS crisis\u201d without improving what a government source describes as an \u201cappalling\u201d situation, in a system that\u2019s meant to look after vulnerable and elderly adults in England.",
      "But multiple sources tell me the Treasury is deeply nervous about the cost and that the prime minister is yet to make a decision on how to proceed.",
      "Talks have so far failed to decide even whether to hold another review of the system. \u201cDither, dither, dither,\u201d said one insider involved in the discussions.",
      "But another source said: \u201cEveryone wants to fix it but we don\u2019t want to embark on something that then doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "I understand the prime minister, health secretary and the Chancellor Rachel Reeves are due to meet a week on Monday to try to make some progress.",
      "What options do they have?",
      "There is little controversy about the scale of the problem in social care, the system that helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing, getting out of bed, eating and medication.",
      "There are as many as 500,000 people waiting for care. Council budgets are stretched, some teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, in part because of care costs. As the population ages, thousands upon thousands of people are stuck without the care they need, and thousands more stuck in hospital because there isn\u2019t the support they need at home.",
      "Labour has given little detail on what its National Care Service would look like, but long-term reform would likely aim to address the shortage of care, the length of waiting lists, and the costs for people who don't qualify for free care, which can be crippling for families.",
      "Why Starmer\u2019s NHS reforms may give you a sense of deja-vu",
      "No extra NHS funding without reform, says PM",
      "Ministers are considering whether to create a Royal Commission to look at the issue or a government-backed independent review, tipped to be led by the straight-talking Whitehall troubleshooter Dame Louise Casey.",
      "The advantage of a Royal Commission? It\u2019s not party political, so theoretically can bind every politician to back its solutions and make the warring parties work together.",
      "The downside? It could take two or three years, pushing possible fixes to the urgent problems until after the next election.",
      "An independent review of a year to 18 months could change things quicker. Without the kudos of the King, any plans would be easier for opposition politicians to reject \u2013 but Labour has a once-in-a-generation majority to vote through big reforms.",
      "There are nerves, however, at the top of government about what any review might recommend. If it suggests an expensive new system quickly, then that would need billions in extra tax. Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

    "title": "How many farms will be affected by Budget tax rises?",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:02:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Estimates of the number of farms affected range from 100 to 70,000.",
    "story": [
      "There has been an outcry from many farmers following the changes to inheritance tax for farms announced in the Budget. Farmers have travelled to London and are taking part in a rally near Parliament to highlight their concerns.",
      "From April 2026, inherited agricultural assets worth more than \u00a31m, which were previously exempt, will have to pay inheritance tax at 20% - half the usual rate.",
      "There have been different claims about how many farms will be affected.",
      "These vary from as many as 70,000 to as few as 500.",
      "Where does the 70,000 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Country Land and Business Association whose president, Victoria Vyvyan said: \"We estimate that capping agricultural property relief at \u00a31m could harm 70,000 UK farms, damaging family businesses and destabilising food security.\"",
      "It was also used by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said the government needed to \"listen to rural communities\" and reverse the change.",
      "It is not a figure for the number of estates that will have to pay inheritance tax each year, it is an estimate of the total number of farms worth enough to pay.",
      "There are a couple of ways to get to that.",
      "Yiorgos Gadanakis, associate professor of agricultural business management at the University of Reading, pointed to various sources, including Defra's Farm Business Survey, which suggest that between about 30 and 35% of farms in the UK could be valued at over \u00a31m.",
      "As there are about 209,000 farm holdings in the UK, that gives an estimate of between 62,700 and 73,150.",
      "Another way is to look at the number of farms that are bigger than about 200 acres (81 hectares), because at average land prices that would be enough to mean inheritance tax was due. That figure comes out at about 70,000.",
      "But of course a farm will only be affected once it is inherited, so 70,000 is not necessarily the right number to use.",
      "Where does the 500 figure come from?",
      "It comes from the Treasury, which says it expects 500 estates to be affected by the changes each year.",
      "There were a total of 462 inherited farms valued above \u00a31m in 2021-22, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC):",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m37 above \u00a35m",
      "345 valued between \u00a31m and \u00a32.5m",
      "80 at \u00a32.5m to \u00a35m",
      "37 above \u00a35m",
      "Under the new rules, those 462 farms would be affected by the 20% inheritance tax on any value above \u00a31m (not on the whole value). The normal rate of inheritance tax is 40%.",
      "However, as Dan Neidle - founder of the independent Tax Policy Associates - points out, like for the rest of the population, there is no inheritance tax to be paid on the value of property up to \u00a3325,000, bringing the untaxed total to \u00a31.325m.",
      "If a farmer is married, his or her spouse would be able to pass on another \u00a31.325m tax free, taking the total untaxed amount to \u00a32.65m.",
      "There were 117 farms valued above \u00a32.5m in 2021-22, according to the HMRC figures.",
      "In addition, there is a \u00a3175,000 tax-free allowance on a main residence when it is  being passed on to children or grandchildren. This brings the total untaxed amount for a farming couple to up to \u00a33m.",
      "Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an independent economy think-tank, told Sky News: \"The changes will affect a remarkably small number of some of the most valuable farms.\"",
      "He added: \"[Farms are] still more generously treated, actually, than farms used to be in decades past.\"",
      "Steve Reed, the secretary of state for the environment, food and rural affairs, confirmed the \"vast majority\" of farmers will not be affected by changes. Writing in the Telegraph, he said \"only the richest estates will be asked to pay\".",
      "He also wrote: \"It\u2019s become the most effective way for the super-rich to avoid paying their inheritance tax.\"",
      "Analysis by the property consultants Strutt & Parker found that 40% of farms that were sold last year in England were bought by investors while 45% were bought by working farmers.",
      "Farmers 'betrayed' by \u00a31m inheritance tax relief cap",
      "Farmers mull selling or protests over tax change",
      "Who pays inheritance tax?",
      "How much could be raised?",
      "The chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, has said that the inheritance tax exemptions currently cost \"about \u00a31bn a year for taxpayers\".",
      "The Treasury expects that the changes to inheritance tax , as well as changes to Business Tax Relief, will raise \u00a3230m in 2026-27, the first year of their introduction. This rises to \u00a3520m by the end of the forecast in 2029-30.",
      "But the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warns that there is high uncertainty around these figures.",
      "Is the tax affordable?",
      "Sam Kirkham, who specialises in agriculture at Albert Goodman accountants, says \"people look at the value of farms and think the farmers must be wealthy\".",
      "But she says if the farm passes down to the next generation to continue to produce food, they never get to realise that capital.",
      "And she adds farm profits are too low to meet the additional cost of inheritance tax.",
      "Government research suggests that an average farm last year made a profit of about \u00a345,300, although that may be overstated as it is based on a survey that excluded farms that bring in the least money.",
      "Other government figures suggest that the average return on capital for farms (the amount of value farmers can extract from things like farmland and machinery by growing crops for example) is only about 0.5%, which is low compared with other businesses.",
      "The government points out that people inheriting farmland would have 10 years to pay the inheritance tax bill interest-free, unlike other inheritance tax, which needs to be paid immediately.",
      "UPDATE 4 November: The unit on a measure of area was corrected from hectares to acres. A sentence was added detailing the residence nil-rate band rate of inheritance tax.",

      "The toy was given to her nearly 30 years ago by a friend and has travelled the world with her. Dr Goodall is now 90 years of age, and she and Mr H are still travelling.",
      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",

      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",

A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",

      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:37:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",

    "story": [
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has denounced the mass rape case of 51 men as a \"trial of cowardice\", and said it is high time that France's \"macho, patriarchal society\" which \"trivialises rape\" changes.",
      "Ms Pelicot, who has attended the mass rape trial from its start in September, entered the court dressed in a dark green jacket and a colourful scarf.  She was questioned by defence lawyers after the last defendant in the case, Philippe L, left the dock.",
      "She has waived her right to anonymity so the entire trial can be heard in court in Avignon in the full glare of publicity.",
      "Her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, has admitted recruiting dozens of men online to rape her over almost a decade at their home in Mazan.",
      "In her opening remarks on Tuesday, Ms Pelicot said that by giving up her right to a trial behind closed doors she \"knew what I was signing up for\", although she conceded \"today I can feel the tiredness\".",
      "Warning: Some of the details of this account are graphic from the start",
      "This was the last chance that lawyers for the men on trial for rape might have to convince the judges that her ex-husband had somehow tricked them into raping her while she was unconscious.",
      "The case has not just shocked France, it has attracted interest from around the world. It has highlighted the issue of drug-induced sexual assault and raised questions about whether consent should become part of the French definition of rape.",
      "A handful of the 50 admit raping Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, but the majority do not.",
      "About 15 defendants sat in the defendants' box, while Dominique Pelicot, wearing a green jumper, sat in another, resting his chin on his hand.",
      "When he gave evidence later in the day, his daughter Caroline shouted at him across the room that she was sick of his lies, laying bare the anger within the family.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot sat behind her legal team alongside her two sons and daughters-in-law.",
      "When asked whether she thought there was a difference between those who had admitted to raping her and those who had not, Ms Pelicot said that \"all came to rape me... all committed a crime\".",
      "But she emphasised that when the accused had admitted to rape in the dock \"I looked them in the eye\".",
      "\"I've seen individuals who deny rape parade before the court,\" she said. \"I want to tell these men: at which moment when you enter that bedroom did Ms Pelicot give you consent?\"",
      "\"I've heard 'I was manipulated', I've heard 'I drank a glass of water, I was drugged'. But at what point did they not realise?\"",
      "Ms Pelicot was also asked why she continued to use her ex-husband's name when her own children had been using other names.",
      "The room was hushed as she responded calmly that when she had first gone into the court in Avignon her children were ashamed of the name, but that her grandchildren were still called Pelicot.",
      "\"Today I want them to be proud of their grandmother,\" she declared.",
      "\"My name is known across the world now. They shouldn't be ashamed of carrying that name. Today we will remember Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.\"",
      "Not long before she took the stand, the last of the 50 defendants, Philippe L, said he had been \"surprised\" by the situation when Dominique Pelicot had welcomed him into his home and insisted that he penetrate Gis\u00e8le Pelicot.",
      "He also denies rape, arguing he put his conscience aside and \"was thinking with my penis instead of my brain\".",
      "The atmosphere in the courtroom became heated when Ms Pelicot was questioned by defence lawyer Nadia El-Bouroumi, who suggested she had used \"harsh words\" towards the other defendants, but not her husband.",
      "\"Looking at you - and I'm sorry to say this - I wondered whether we'd ever see you cry,\" El-Bouroumi asked at one point.",
      "The lawyer's combative and sometimes aggressive tone elicited gasps from the public and the media inside the courtroom, and several people shook their heads in disbelief.",
      "Final phase for mass rape trial that has horrified France",
      "Ms Pelicot rejected suggestions that looking back she might have \"seen the signs\" that something might not have been right on the mornings after being drugged: \"I would wake up with my usual pyjamas on, so no.\"",
      "She spoke of losing 10 years of her life through medical worries caused by the drugs her former husband had given her without her knowledge.",
      "\"I thought I'd either die or end up in a mental hospital,\" she reflected. \"I am 72 now and I don't know how much time I have left.\"",
      "She was then asked by defence lawyers about partially naked images found on Dominique Pelicot's laptop of their daughter Caroline.",
      "The Pelicot's children then stormed out of the courtroom and did not come back for some time, while Gis\u00e8le Pelicot said later that it \"isn't a family trial\".",
      "When a defence lawyer put it to Ms Pelicot that she was still under her ex-husband's control and could not bring herself to condemn him fully, she stood silently in court as the lawyers from both sides shouted at each other.",
      "The presiding judge had to intervene to bring the argument to an end.",
      "Later in the day the court heard a statement from Dominique Pelicot given to police in November 2020, two months after he was caught filming under women's skirts by a supermarket security guard.",
      "That eventually led police to find thousands of videos that he had filmed of men having sex with his wife while she was unconscious. She had no idea of what had gone on and realised he had been drugging her from 2011 to 2020.",
      "Dominique Pelicot, who has admitted all the charges, was asked by Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's lawyer what he had to say to his family, especially his daughter Caroline.",
      "When asked about the file he had called \"my naked daughter\", he addressed her across the room: \"I have watched her fall apart... Caroline, I never touched you.\"",
      "She shouted across the court: \"You are lying; I am sick of your lies, you're alone in your lie, you will die lying.\"",
      "There was complete silence as they looked at each other and Dominique Pelicot then held his head in his hands.",
      "The rest of the family, their faces filled with anguish, stared at him, while Gis\u00e8le Pelicot herself did not react.",
      "Asked whether he accepted that he had manipulated the other defendants into raping his wife or if he had drugged them, he said firmly: \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "He suggested they had used that defence \"to save themselves\".",
      "The trial is due to wind up next month with a verdict in the second half of December."

    "story": [
      "A Hong Kong court has sentenced dozens of pro-democracy leaders to years in jail for subversion, following a controversial national security trial.",
      "Benny Tai, 60, and Joshua Wong, 28, were among the so-called Hong Kong 47 group of activists and lawmakers who were involved in a plan to pick opposition candidates for local elections.",
      "Tai received 10 years while Wong received more than four years. A total of 45 people were jailed for conspiring to commit subversion. Two of the defendants were acquitted in May.",
      "This was the biggest trial under the national security law (NSL) which China imposed on the city shortly after explosive pro-democracy protests in 2019.",
      "Hundreds of thousands took to the streets in a months-long standoff against Beijing. Triggered by a proposed government treaty that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, the protests quickly grew to reflect wider demands for democratic reform.",
      "Observers say the NSL and the trial's outcome have significantly weakened the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement and rule of law, allowing China to cement its control of the former British colony.",
      "Who are the activists jailed in Hong Kong's largest national security trial?",
      "What is Hong Kong's national security law?",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong\u2019s government deny this, arguing instead that the NSL is necessary to maintain stability. They also say these sentences serve as a warning for those trying to undermine China\u2019s national security.",
      "\"No one can engage in illegal activities in the name of democracy and attempt to escape justice,\" China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. It also said that it was \"firmly opposed\" to Western countries \"undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong\".",
      "'Their families are devastated'",
      "The city's pro-democracy campaigners reacted to the sentences with disappointment and sadness.",
      "\"We are very distressed and their families are devastated,\" Emily Lau, former chair of the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that she and many others were not able to enter the courtroom because it was full. Tuesday's hearing attracted huge interest from Hongkongers, dozens of whom queued up outside days before to secure a spot in the public gallery.",
      "Many of the 45 people on trial were icons of Hong Kong's protest movement. Tai, a law professor, shot to fame as a key leader back in 2014, Wong was still a teenager when he took to activism, and Gwyneth Ho, a young former journalist,  was admitted to hospital after a mob attack during the 2019 protests.",
      "Veteran former lawmakers such as Claudia Mo and Leung Kwok-hung, also known as Long Hair, spent much of their careers fighting for a freer Hong Kong, and first-time activists such as Owen Chou and Tiffany Yuen stormed the legislative council in what was a defining moment for the protests.",
      "All of them were in court in a rare public appearance as many have been in jail since their arrest in early 2021 because pre-trial detention is common under the NSL.",
      "Standing in line on Tuesday was Lee Yue-shun, one of the two defendants acquitted. He told reporters he wanted to urge Hongkongers to \"raise questions\" about the case, as \"everyone has a chance to be affected\" by its outcome.",
      "There were several activists waiting to enter court. Bobo Lam, who was once arrested under the NSL, said he was showing up to support friends who are now in jail and \"let them know, that there are still many HongKongers who haven't forgotten them\". Others seemed heartened by how many people had showed up, suggesting they \"remember what happened\".",
      "An elderly woman, Regina Fung, chanted \"everybody hang in there, stand for Hong Kong\" before the hearing. \"It's very sad, even the weather in Hong Kong is miserable today,\" she said.",
      "Inside the courtroom, family members and friends waved from the public gallery to the defendants, who appeared calm as they sat in the dock. Some in the gallery had tears in their eyes as the sentences, ranging from four to 10 years, were read out.",
      "Tai, a former law professor who came up with the plan for the unofficial primary, received the longest sentence with judges saying he had \"advocated for a revolution\".",
      "Wong had his sentence reduced by a third after he pleaded guilty. But unlike some other defendants, he was not given further reductions as judges \"did not consider him to be a person of good character\". At the time of the arrests, Wong was already in jail for participating in protests.",
      "In court, Wong shouted \"I love Hong Kong\" before he left the dock.",
      "As Leung's wife, activist Chan Po-ying, walked out of the court at the end of the hearing, she was heard chanting a protest against his jail term.",
      "The 'illegal' primary",
      "The UK government said those sentenced had been \"exercising their right to freedom of speech, of assembly and of political participation\".",
      "\"Today\u2019s sentencing is a clear demonstration of the Hong Kong authorities\u2019 use of the NSL to criminalise political dissent,\" a UK government statement said.",
      "The US has described the trial as \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. Australia said it had \"strong objections\" to the use of the NSL and it was \"gravely concerned\" by the sentencing of one of its citizens, Gordon Ng.",
      "The ruling comes a day after UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met with China's Xi Jinping at the G20 summit - a meeting which saw him raise the case of Jimmy Lai, the billionaire pro-democracy activist on trial for treason.",
      "Asked directly about Tuesday's ruling, he defended pursuing closer ties with Beijing, saying that while it was \"important\" to be \"open... and talk about our disagreements\", it was also in the \"national interest\" to have a\" serious and pragmatic relationship\" with China.",
      "\"I certainly hope the British government, the prime minister, will stand up for the rights that they promised the Hong Kong people. All these promises, these rights and rule of law are evaporating,\" Ms Lau told the BBC. She asked why organising an election should warrant jail time.",
      "After the 2019 protests dwindled with the Covid pandemic, the defendants organised an unofficial primary for the Legislative Council election as a way to continue the pro-democracy movement.",
      "Their aim was to increase the opposition\u2019s chances of blocking the pro-Beijing government\u2019s bills. More than half a million Hongkongers turned out to vote in the primary held in July 2020.",
      "Organisers argued at the time that their actions were allowed under Hong Kong's Basic Law - a mini-constitution that allows certain freedoms.",
      "But it alarmed Beijing and Hong Kong officials, who warned that the move could breach the NSL, which came into effect days before the primary. They accused the activists of attempting to \u201coverthrow\u201d the government, and arrested them in early 2021.",
      "The trial judges agreed with the prosecution\u2019s argument that the plan would have created a constitutional crisis.",
      "'National security is the priority'",
      "\"Central authorities are using the trial to re-educate the Hong Kong people,\" said John P Burns, emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong. The lesson being \"national security is the country\u2019s top priority; don\u2019t challenge us on national security\u2019\u201d.",
      "\"The case is significant because it provides clues to the health of Hong Kong\u2019s legal system,\" he told the BBC. \"How can it be illegal to follow processes laid down in the Basic Law?\"",
      "A Human Rights Watch spokesperson said that China and Hong Kong \"have now significantly raised the costs for promoting democracy in Hong Kong\".",
      "Stephan Ortmann, assistant professor of politics at the Hong Kong Metropolitan University, agreed. Tuesday's sentencing \"set a precedent for the severity of punishments for political dissent under the NSL\", adding that \"self-censorship has become the norm\".",
      "But this isn't a win for Beijing, said Sunny Cheung, an activist who ran in the 2020 primary but has since fled to the US. \"They might be happy in a way because the entire opposition is being wiped out... but they don\u2019t have the trust of the people.\u201d",
      "Others, like Ms Lau, said the city had already lost more than a generation of pro-democracy campaigners.",
      "There has been \"no permission for marches and demonstrations in the past few years - it's very, very quiet, very peaceful,\" she said.",
      "\"But that's not Hong Kong. If you have been to Hong Kong, you know it is a city of protest. Very colourful, very vibrant, but not any more.\"",

      "A convoy of 109 UN aid lorries carrying food was violently looted in Gaza on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says.",
      "Ninety-seven of the lorries were lost and their drivers were forced at gunpoint to unload their aid after passing through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, in what is believed to have been one of the worst incidents of its kind.",
      "Eyewitnesses said the convoy was attacked by masked men who threw grenades.",
      "Unrwa commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini did not identify the perpetrators, but he said the \u201ctotal breakdown of civil order\u201d in Gaza meant it had \u201cbecome an impossible environment to operate in\u201d.",
      "Without immediate intervention, severe food shortages are set to worsen for the two million people depending on humanitarian aid to survive, according to Unrwa.",
      "A UN-backed assessment warned earlier this month that there was \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip\u201d.",
      "It came after Israeli forces launched a major ground offensive in the north and the UN said fewer aid lorries had entered Gaza last month than at any time since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October 2023.",
      "Saturday\u2019s looting was first reported by Reuters news agency, which cited an Unrwa official in Gaza as saying that the convoy was instructed by Israeli authorities to \"depart at short notice via an unfamiliar route\" from Kerem Shalom.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said its security staff killed \"more than 20 members of gangs involved in stealing aid trucks\" in an operation carried out in cooperation with \"tribal committees\", a network of traditional family clans.",
      "Lazzarini said he could not comment on the route when asked at a news conference in Geneva on Monday, but he confirmed the looting and said: \u201cWe have been warning a long time ago about the total breakdown of civil order.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntil four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy. This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south. It has become an impossible environment to operate in.\u201d",
      "He added that hundreds of people desperate for food had tried to storm the Unrwa-run vocational centre in the southern city of Khan Younis because they thought the aid had been delivered there.",
      "\u201cBut the convoys were looted and there was absolutely nothing to take from the warehouses.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor months now, aid has been piling up on the Gazan side, after Israeli inspection, waiting for collection and distribution, and we've been taking many measures to assist with the pick-up of aid,\u201d it added.",
      "Israel has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid that can be delivered into and across Gaza, and accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group has denied.",
      "Last week, a group of 29 non-governmental organisations said in a report that the looting of aid convoys was \u201ca consequence of Israel's targeting of the remaining police forces in Gaza, scarcity of essential goods, lack of routes and closure of most crossing points, and the subsequent desperation of the population amid these dire conditions\u201d.",

      "It easily dwarfed the 5,000-strong crowd that turned up for land rights in 1975, and double the size of another major h\u012bkoi in 2004, which rallied for shore and sea ownership rights.",

      "\u201cYour starting point is to take a human being and ask, what's your ancestry? What kind of human are you? That used to be called prejudice. It used to be called bigotry. It used to be called profiling and discrimination. Now you're trying to make a virtue of it. I think that's a big mistake.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, inside the Beehive, MPs discussed the bill.",
      "Among them was Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who said it would not pass into law - despite him being part of the same coalition as Act.",

      "\"We don't think through the stroke of a pen you go rewrite 184 years of debate and discussion.\"",

We are all New Zealanders. I think we should work together and have equal rights.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t live equally if we have one people who are the indigenous people living \u2018less than\u2019,\u201d she argued. What the coalition government is doing is \u201can absolute attempt to divide an otherwise progressive country and it\u2019s really embarrassing\u201d.",
      "New Zealand's parliament was brought to a temporary halt last week by MPs performing a haka, or traditional dance, in opposition to the bill. Footage of the incident went viral.",
      "\u201cTo see it in parliament, in the highest house in Aotearoa, there\u2019s been a real state of surprise and I think disappointment and sadness that in 2024 when we see politics and the Trump extremes, this is what the M\u0101ori are having to endure,\u201d said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer. \u201cIt\u2019s humiliating for the government because we [New Zealand] are normally seen as punching above our weight in all of the great things in life.\u201d",

      "This time, she brought her children and grandchildren.",
      "\u201cThis is our grandchildren\u2019s legacy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one person or one party \u2013 and to alter [it] is wrong.\u201d"

      "Despite concern on the street, she says his return comes as \u201cno surprise\u201d to Beijing, although she warns that the world should still \u201cexpect a roller-coaster type of relationship to unfold\u201d when Trump takes office in January.",
      "Beijing\u2019s \u201ccold war\u201d warning to Washington",
      "The competition between the two nations has been ramping up for some time, long before Trump won the election. It turned especially tense during the Biden administration because of tariffs and geopolitical disagreements ranging from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine to the future of Taiwan.",
      "Yet there was dialogue, with several senior US officials making trips to Beijing.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to work with the incoming Trump administration, but he also used his last meeting with President Joe Biden to warn Washington that a \u201cnew cold war should not be fought and cannot be won\u201d.",
      "He added that \u201ccontaining China is unwise, unacceptable and bound to fail\u201d.",
      "Beijing has long accused the US and its allies of trying to contain China \u2013 they see tariffs targeting Chinese-made imports, laws restricting the country\u2019s access to advanced AI chips and military alliances in the South China Sea and beyond as part of this approach.",
      "And Trump\u2019s decision to pick Rubio and Waltz suggests his administration will \u201ctake a much harsher, muscular approach with China,\u201d says Lyle Morris from the Asia Society\u2019s Centre for China Analysis.",
      "\u201cWhile Trump views his personal relationship with Xi Jinping as an avenue for negotiation, he will likely lean on Waltz and Rubio in fashioning a more aggressive, uncompromising policy towards China.\u201d",
      "They are far from the only voices in Washington that see China as a threat to US security and its economy \u2013 a view that surprises the average person in Beijing.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re much better off here than in the US right now,\u201d says the 74-year-old in the park before heading off to stretch.",
      "From Covid blame to nuclear competition",
      "Just north of the Temple of Heaven is the Forbidden City, where Chinese emperors lived for almost 500 years. It was here, in 2017, that Xi hosted Trump, bestowing on his guest an honour not granted to any US president since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Xi shut down the area and took Trump on a tour of the imperial quarters, every moment broadcast live on state TV. He was served kung pao chicken for dinner, and in turn brought a video of his granddaughter, Arabella Kushner, singing a Chinese song which went viral on social media.",
      "It was billed by both as a high point in US-China relations, but that quickly soured after the Covid pandemic broke out in Wuhan in 2019 and spread globally in 2020. Trump repeatedly called it the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and blamed the outbreak on Beijing. He also kicked off a tit-for-tat trade war, with tariffs still in place on more than $300bn (\u00a3238bn) of goods.",
      "When Trump starts his second term, he will be encountering a stronger Xi, who has cemented his position at China\u2019s helm with a historic third term \u2013 and the possibility of remaining in power for life.",
      "Given it has the world\u2019s largest army and navy, Washington is now concerned that the country is building a bigger nuclear arsenal.",
      "Even as Trump was unveiling his new cabinet, Chinese state media published videos from the country\u2019s biggest airshow of a new stealth fighter jet \u2013 the J35-A \u2013 flying vertically and upside-down. China is only the second country to boast two stealth fighters in its inventory. The other is the US. The world\u2019s first two-seat stealth fighter, the J20-S, was also on display.",
      "Last week, researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California found satellite images that indicate China is working on nuclear propulsion for a new aircraft carrier.",
      "The studies have \u201csparked serious concerns over Beijing\u2019s potential adoption of a first-use strategy and increased nuclear threats, fuelling strong support to significantly boost US nuclear capabilities in response,\u201d says Tong Zhao from think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cUnless Trump personally intervenes, which seems unlikely, it appears the two nations are on the brink of a much more intense nuclear competition with far-reaching implications for international stability.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan question",
      "Under Xi\u2019s leadership in recent years, China has also become more assertive in its territorial claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.",
      "One worry is that Beijing is ramping up militarily to invade Taiwan, which it sees as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control. Under Trump and his cabinet, would the US be willing to defend Taiwan?",
      "It\u2019s a question asked of every US president. Trump has dodged it, saying he wouldn\u2019t have to use military force because Xi knew he was \u201ccrazy\u201d, and he would impose paralysing tariffs on Chinese imports if that happened.",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s unwillingness to participate in foreign wars, most experts expect Washington to continue providing military assistance to Taipei. For one, it is bound by law to sell defensive weapons to the island. Two, the Trump administration sold more arms to Taiwan than any other.",
      "\u201cThere is strong bipartisan support for continuing military aid to Taiwan. I don\u2019t expect Trump to significantly change course on arms sales to Taiwan,\u201d Mr Morris says.",
      "What Trump really thinks of Xi",
      "These glaring differences aside, Trump does seem to admire Xi\u2019s strongman image.",
      "In 2020 he declared that he and Xi Jinping \u201clove each other\u201d, even in the midst of a bitter trade war with China.",
      "\u201cI had a very strong relationship with him,\u201d he confirmed in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know what Xi thinks \u2013 he has said very little about their relationship and barely mentions Trump by name.",
      "In 2018, Chinese state media CGTN took direct aim at the American leader, and released an unflattering video with the sarcastic title: \u201cThanks Mr Trump, you are great!\u201d It was later taken down by censors.",
      "But what we do know is both leaders project a type of muscular nationalism. Xi\u2019s dream is the \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\" and Trump believes only he can \u201cmake America great again\u201d. Both promise that they are working towards a new golden age for their countries.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d for America incudes 60% tariffs on Chinese-made goods.",
      "But Beijing is in no mood for a second trade war. It has troubles of its own.",
      "A sluggish economy vs the Musk factor",
      "President Xi\u2019s dream of prosperity is in jeopardy. China\u2019s economy is sluggish, its property sector is sinking, nearly 20% of its young people are struggling to find jobs and it has one of the world\u2019s fastest growing ageing populations.",
      "Some of this economic pain is clear at the Temple of Heaven. We join the throngs of Chinese tour groups walking through white marble gates. It has become fashionable for young people to dress up in Qing dynasty costumes although their long silk robes often fail to hide the other big trend \u2013 chunky white trainers.",
      "Dozens of school groups are listening attentively to guides about their city\u2019s colourful history while a queue forms around the altar to make a wish. I watch as a middle-aged woman dressed in black takes her turn. She turns three times, clasps her hands, closes her eyes and looks toward the sky. Later we ask what she hoped for. She says many people come here and ask for their children to get jobs or to get into a good school.",
      "\u201cWe wish for better lives and prospects,\u201d she says. While China claims to have eradicated extreme poverty, millions of labourers and factory workers across the country, those who contributed to China\u2019s rise, will worry what about what\u2019s to come.",
      "Her future and the future of China\u2019s economy may partly depend on just how serious Trump is about his tariffs. This time, Beijing is prepared, according to Yu Jie.",
      "\u201cChina has already begun to diversify its sources of agricultural imports (notably from Brazil, Argentina and Russia) and increased the volumes of its exports in non-US allied countries. At a domestic level, the recent local government debt recapitalisation is also paving the way to offset the negative impacts on the likely trade war with the Trump Administration.\u201d",
      "Beijing may also have another hope. Billionaire Elon Musk now appears to have Trump\u2019s ear. His company, Tesla, depends on China for production - about half of all its EVs are made in the country. Chinese leaders may ask if Musk can temper Trump\u2019s trade impulses.",
      "But the great power struggle of the 21st century is not just over trade. Xi\u2019s dream also involves making China the world\u2019s dominant power.",
      "Some experts believe this is where another Trump presidency may offer Beijing an opportunity.",
      "China\u2019s place on the world stage",
      "\u201cChinese leaders will reinforce the narrative that the US is the single and most disruptive source of global instability, while portraying China as a responsible and confident world power,\u201d says Yu Jie.",
      "Biden spent four years building up friendships across Asia with the likes of South Korea, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam - all in an effort to contain China.",
      "In the past, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica-first\u201d doctrine isolated and weakened these US alliances. He opted for deals over delicate diplomacy and often put a price tag on America\u2019s friendships. In 2018, for instance, he demanded more money from South Korea to continue keeping US troops in the country.",
      "Beijing has already built up alliances with emerging economies. It is also trying to repair its relationship with the UK and Europe, while mending historical grievances with Asian neighbours, South Korea and Japan.",
      "If Washington\u2019s influence does wane around the world, it could be a win for President Xi.",

    "summary": "It is not clear if Biden's decision will be endorsed by Donald Trump who has promised to end the Ukraine war.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden's apparent green light for Ukraine to strike Russia with US-made long-range missiles has caused consternation among some of Donald Trump's allies.",
      "Trump himself has not commented, but he won the election after promising to end the war - and several people close to him have condemned the move as dangerous escalation.",
      "Biden has committed tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv's war effort, and at the weekend he reportedly ditched a long-standing red line on Ukraine's use of American weaponry to launch attacks deep into Russia.",
      "Donald Trump Jr tweeted that the president was trying to \"get World War Three going\" before his father took office.",
      "Biden's decision has not been formally confirmed and it may never be.",
      "When asked about how typical it would be for a presidential administration to take such a significant policy decision in its final months, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Biden was \"elected to a four year-term, not a term of three years and 10 months.\"",
      "\"We will use every day of our term to pursue policy interests that we believe are in the interests of the American people,\" he said. \"If the incoming administration wants to take a different view, that is, of course, their right to do so.\"",
      "\"There's one president at a time,\" he added. \"When the next president takes office, he can make his own decisions.\"",
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said no such announcement was forthcoming - \"missiles will speak for themselves\".",
      "Trump's camp is not pleased",
      "Trump swept to victory on 5 November and is due to be back in the White House for a second term from 20 January next year.",
      "Trump has campaigned on a promise to end the US involvement in wars and instead use taxpayers' money to improve Americans' lives.",
      "He has said he will bring the Russia-Ukraine war to an end within 24 hours, without saying how.",
      "One thing is certain, though: Trump has always seen himself as a dealmaker and will not want Biden to take any such credit.",
      "His son, Donald Trump Jr, was among the first Republicans to respond.",
      "\"The military industrial complex seems to want to make sure they get World War Three going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,\" he said.",
      "Another vocal Trump supporter, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, condemned Biden, too.",
      "\"The American people gave a mandate on Nov 5th against these exact America last decisions and do NOT want to fund or fight foreign wars. We want to fix our own problems,\" she wrote on X.",
      "Not all of Trump's allies, including some who advised him on national security affairs during his first term, shared this view - though they were critical of the Biden administration's approach.",
      "James Gilmore, who served as Trump's ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, told the BBC that the main issue with Biden's decision to provide Ukraine this new capability is that it came so late in the war.",
      "\"My criticism of Biden is the same as every other conservative and supporter of Trump - which is that the Biden administration slow walked this,\" he said.",
      "Gilmore said he did not know what the president-elect would choose to do regarding Ukraine once he entered office. \"I don't believe that he's a man that usually walks away,\" he said.",
      "Polls suggest a large number of Republicans want US support for Ukraine to stop - 62% told a poll by Pew Research the US had no responsibility to support the country against Russia.",
      "Senator JD Vance, who will be Trump's vice-president, has regularly objected to providing arms to Ukraine. He argued that the US lacks the manufacturing capacity to continue providing weapons like the missile systems that Kyiv will use to strike within Russia.",
      "Gilmore, however, said the US was able to backfill and upgrade its weapon systems through this process, but he said the US's European allies would need to take on a bigger role.",
      "\"President Trump is exactly right about this - the alliance is stronger when Western European countries step up to the plate,\" he said. \"The United States cannot continue to act alone. The taxpayer won't permit it, the next administration won't permit it, and I wouldn't, either.\"",
      "Putin is also silent",
      "Since launching the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia's president has been railing against the US-led Nato alliance - and described every pledge of military support by the Western allies for Ukraine as a direct involvement and warned of retribution.",
      "His spokesman said on Monday that the US was \"adding fuel to the fire\".",
      "At times, Putin has mooted the possibility of using nuclear weapons, too.",
      "Few believe this may come to pass as, under the mutual-destruction doctrine established during the Cold War when nuclear arsenals were built up, Putin knows their use would bring untold suffering to all, including Russians.",

      "Live: Reaction to the US decision",

      "Former US envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, said Biden's decision would enable Ukraine \"to go after airfields, the ammunition depots and the fuels supplies, logistics that Russia has, which right now are in a sanctuary zone in Russia\".",
      "Biden's decision will cause Russia to be more cautious, Volker told the BBC.",
      "Dismissing Putin's threats, he said the Russian leader \"should have anticipated that there would be efforts by Ukraine to fire back\".",
      "Ukraine has had ATACMS as well as UK and French Storm Shadow missiles of similar range for some time, though the numbers are not known. But it has not been allowed to use them inside Russia.",
      "France and the UK are expected to follow the US lead and issue the same authorisation to Ukraine. So far, they have not commented.",
      "White House officials are emphasising to US media that Biden's change of heart is in response to Russia\u2019s deployment of North Korean troops - a signal to Pyongyang not to send any more.",
      "Gilmore, Trump's OSCE ambassador, told the BBC that he believes it is \"Putin who has escalated the war\" by deploying North Korean soldiers, and the US cannot \"just stand aside and let this dictator go ahead and conquer Ukraine\".",
      "\"I don't like it and I take it all very seriously, but the decision is not ours. The decision is being forced upon us by Putin - by the dictator,\" he said.",

Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",

While his party has a majority, it would only take four \u201cno\u201d votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.",

      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",
      "\u201cNo-one has done more,\u201d he told an Israeli radio station. \u201cPresident Trump and I fully expect that will continue.\u201d",
      "What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",
      "The appointment was greeted with joy by two far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to \u201ca consistent and loyal friend\", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote \"Mike Huckabee\" with heart emojis.",

      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",
      "Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump\u2019s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September.",
      "It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump\u2019s dealings with Israel.",
      "In July, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership was good for Israel and the entire region\u201d.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",
      "He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians.",
      "Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",
      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",

      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

      "Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News on Sunday \"we know he promised to sign an executive order to secure the southern border\".",
      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.",
      "In the week since his re-election, Trump has prioritised filling leadership positions that would oversee immigration, suggesting he is preparing to tackle his plans for border policy early.",
      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.",
      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",
      "He would need states to agree to a national convention or a two-thirds vote in favour in the narrowly split Congress to propose a change, then subsequent approval by three-fourths of state legislatures - of which Republicans control just over half.",

      "What Trump's got wrong on birthright law",
      "6 January",
      "Trump did not mention pardons in his victory speech, but he has long suggested that pardoning those convicted of storming the Capitol in 2021 would be a priority.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Jack Smith",
      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump and his supporters will still try to punish Mr Smith. Congressional Republicans have reportedly implied they intend to investigate his work.",
      "\"Jack Smith\u2019s abuse of the justice system cannot go unpunished\", billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk posted on social media.",
      "Trump had said firing Jack Smith is one of his top priorities.",
      "\"I would fire him within two seconds. He\u2019ll be one of the first things addressed,\" he said in an interview in October.",
      "Trump regularly railed against the special counsel in interviews and online, calling him a \"crooked person\", a \"scoundrel\" and other insults.",
      "Smith's cases were already facing an uncertain future. The Supreme Court ruled in July that presidents have partial immunity from criminal prosecution for their conduct in office, undermining Mr Smith's work.",

      "What happens to Trump\u2019s convictions and legal cases after election win?",
      "Paris climate agreement",
      "In his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal.",
      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.",
      "How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January.",
      "Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions.",
      "Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - \"We\u2019re drilling, drilling, drilling,\" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year.",
      "Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.",
      "Russia and Ukraine",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.",
      "He has not yet given specifics on how he would negotiate the war's end beyond saying he would help the two countries strike a deal.",
      "Since his re-election, Trump has spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a call that lasted \"about half an hour\", with billionaire Elon Musk also taking part. A source told the BBC that \"it was not really a conversation to talk about very substantial things\".",
      "The Kremlin denied that Trump held a call with Vladimir Putin, though media reports said Trump warned the Russian president against escalating the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trade and economy",
      "The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office.",
      "\u201cWe will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\u201d Trump has said.",
      "\u201cI will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.\u201d",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to \u201cuse every tool and authority at their disposal\u201d to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.",
      "He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,\u201d he has said.",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.",
      "Another promise is to \u201cend the Biden-Harris war on American energy\u201d, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.",
      "Title X",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country\u2019s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump\u2019s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.",
      "Now, it\u2019s expected that Trump will change the rules again.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk has been tasked with leading incoming President Donald Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "In a statement on social media, the US president-elect said Musk - along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy - would \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies\".",
      "It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for.",

      "What top team picks tell us about Trump 2.0",
      "Will Trump be sentenced over hush money case?",
      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",

While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",

      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",

      "One of his tasks as defence secretary could be to act on Trump's campaign promises to get rid of US generals who he accuses of pursuing progressive policies in the force.",
      "Before his selection by Trump, Hegseth was asked on the same podcast about what changes he would make in the military. He referred to \"first of all\" firing the US' top military officer, Gen Charles \"CQ\" Brown Jr, saying people involved in diversity, equality or inclusion policies had \"got to go\".",
      "\"Either you're in for war fighting and that's it, that's the only litmus test we care about,\" Hegseth told the Shawn Ryan Show, in an episode released last week.",

      "On the same podcast, Hegseth also said \"whatever\" combat standards were in 1995, \"let's just make those the standards\".",
      "What has the reaction been?",
      "Hegseth's pick has been welcomed by a number of prominent Republican figures, but other reactions have been more varied.",
      "North Carolina senator Thom Tillis told Associated Press the choice was \"interesting\", and Senator Tommy Tuberville, of Alabama, said he would \"have to think\" about what he thought of the appointment.",

      "Then there are those who were not involved in politics but were galvanised by the 2019 protests - social workers like Hendrick Lui, entrepreneurs like Mike Lam and a former nurse, Winnie Yu.",
      "Most of the defendants have been in jail since the arrests in early 2021, as pre-trial detentions have become the norm under the NSL.",
      "Laurence Lau, a barrister and former district councillor, and Lee Yue-shun, also a former district councillor, were acquitted in May.",
      "The professor - Benny Tai",
      "One of the main organisers of the 2020 primary, Tai has been labelled by China as a \u201chardcore troublemaker\u201d for allegedly advocating Hong Kong independence and describing the Communist Party\u2019s rule as a \u201cdictatorship\u201d.",
      "A scholar and law professor, Tai first rose to prominence in 2014 when he founded the pro-democracy Occupy Central movement along with two others.",
      "It was a historic civil disobedience campaign that called for fair and free elections in Hong Kong, and saw hundreds of thousands take to the streets.",
      "In 2019, Tai was sentenced to prison for his role in the Occupy Central protests.",
      "A year later, after the NSL was imposed, he was fired from his tenured job at the prestigious University of Hong Kong (HKU) over his criminal conviction.",

      "By 2014, he had become the face of the Umbrella Movement, a mass student protest with the umbrella as a symbol, which sprang up alongside the Occupy Central sit-in.",
      "He was just 20 when his activism landed him in jail, the first of what would be several convictions.",
      "In 2019, Hong Kong erupted in months-long protests as hundreds of thousands marched against a hugely controversial extradition bill that would allow Hongkongers to be sent to mainland China to face trial.",

      "The 68-year-old was known for his political theatrics - one of his signature moves involved hurling bananas as a sign of protest. When he was sworn in again as a lawmaker in 2016, he released a balloon with a political banner and held a yellow umbrella, declaring that the \u201cUmbrella Movement would never end\u201d.",

      "The 37-year-old married his partner in New York in 2013 and fought for Hong Kong to recognise overseas same-sex marriages. Hong Kong\u2019s top court granted him a partial victory in 2023 when it ordered the government to establish a framework to  recognise same-sex partnerships.",

    "story": [
      "Last month, Ellen Konyak was shocked to discover that a 19th-Century skull from the north-eastern Indian state of Nagaland was up for auction in the UK.",
      "The horned skull of a Naga tribesman was among thousands of items that European colonial administrators had collected from the state.",
      "Konyak, a member of the Naga Forum for Reconciliation (NFR) which is making efforts to bring these human remains back home, says the news of the auction disturbed her.",
      "\u201cTo see that people are still auctioning our ancestral human remains in the 21st Century was shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very insensitive and deeply hurtful.\u201d",
      "The Swan at Tetsworth, the UK-based antique centre that put the skull on auction, advertised it as part of their \u201cCurious Collector Sale\u201d, valued between \u00a33,500 ($4,490) and \u00a34,000 ($5,132). Alongside the skull - which is from a Belgian collection \u2013 the sale listed shrunken heads from the Jivaro people of South America and skulls from the Ekoi people of West Africa.",
      "Naga scholars and experts protested against the sale. The chief minister of Nagaland, Konyak\u2019s home state, wrote a letter to the Indian foreign ministry describing the act as \u201cdehumanising\u201d and \u201ccontinued colonial violence upon our people\u201d.",
      "The auction house withdrew the sale following the outcry, but for the Naga people the episode revived memories of their violent past, prompting them to renew calls for the repatriation of their ancestral remains stored or displayed far from their homeland.",
      "Scholars suggest that some of these human remains were bartered items or gifts, but others may have been taken away without the consent of their owners.",
      "Alok Kumar Kanungo, a scholar of Naga culture, estimates that the UK\u2019s public museums and private collections alone hold around 50,000 Naga objects.",
      "Oxford University's Pitt Rivers Museum (PRM), which has the largest Naga collection, features approximately 6,550 items taken from the state, including 41 human remains. The museum also has human remains from several other states of British India.",
      "But in recent years, experts say, with growing ethical concerns about collection, sale and display of human remains, many collectors are reconsidering their approach.",
      "Kanungo says human remains have become \u201cwhite elephants\u201d for museums.",
      "\"They are no longer an object that can be disposed of or possessed by its owners; no longer a source of tourists\u2019 money; can no longer be used to present Naga peoples as \u2018uncivilised\u2019; and of late have become an emotionally and politically charged issue.\u201d",
      "So, museums have started returning human remains from communities such as the Maori tribes of New Zealand, the Mudan warriors of Taiwan, the Aboriginal people of Australia and the Native Hawaiians.",
      "In 2019, PRM told the BBC that it had returned 22 such objects.",
      "A museum spoksperson told the BBC that the figure has now gone up to 35. \"So far these [objects] have all been returned to Australia, New Zealand, US and Canada.\"",
      "As part of an ethical review, the museum removed Naga skulls from public display in 2020 and placed them in storage. This is when FNR demanded their repatriation for the first time.",
      "The museum said it was yet to receive a formal claim from Naga descendants and the processes to return human remains \"can take between 18 months and several years, depending on the complexity of the case\".",
      "Repatriating human remains is more complicated than returning artefacts. It requires extensive research to determine whether the items were collected ethically, to identify descendants and to navigate complex international regulations on movement of human remains.",
      "The Naga forum has formed a group called Recover, Restore and Decolonise under anthropologists Dolly Kikon and Arkotong Longkumer to facilitate returns.",
      "\u201cIt is a bit like detective work,\u201d Longkumer said. \u201cWe have to sift through different layers of information and try to read between the lines to actually find out about the exact nature of the collections and where they are from.\u201d",
      "But for the Naga people, this process is not merely logistical. \u201cWe are dealing with human remains,\u201d said Konyak. \u201cIt\u2019s an international and legal process, but it\u2019s also a spiritual one for us.\u201d",
      "The group has been travelling to villages, meeting Naga elders, organising lectures and distributing educational materials such as comic books and videos to spread awareness.",
      "They are also trying to build consensus around subjects such as the last rites of repatriated remains. Most Nagas now follow Christianity, but their ancestors were animists who followed different birth and death rituals.",
      "The group found that even Naga elders were unaware that their ancestral remains were in foreign land. Anthropologist and archaeologist Tiatoshi Jamir said one elder told him that this could make \u201cthe soul of their ancestors restless\u201d.",
      "Jamir said even he was not aware about the skulls on display in foreign museums until he read about them in a local paper in the early 2000s.",
      "The British took over the Naga areas in 1832 and, in 1873, introduced a special permission for travellers \u2013 called the Inner Line Permit \u2013 to strictly control access to the region.",
      "Historians say the colonial administrators put down any rebellions and often burnt Naga villages to subdue them, in the process erasing much of their important cultural markers such as paintings, engravings and artefacts.",
      "Konyak says she has discovered that one of the human remains in PRM's list is of a person from her village and tribe.",
      "\u201cI am like, \u2018Oh my goodness! It belongs to one of my ancestors',\" she told the BBC.",

      "He was the 12th of his father's 18 children.",
      "After completing primary and secondary school in Ghana, Bawumia moved to the UK for undergraduate study and went on to gain a masters in economics from the prestigious Oxford University.",
      "To support himself during his studies, he took up jobs as a taxi driver and cleaner.",
      "He returned to Ghana in 2000 to work at the central bank, where he worked his way up to become deputy governor.",
      "Bawumia campaigned on this economic know-how during his attempts to become VP. Therefore, he faced heavy criticism when Ghana plummeted into its most severe economic crisis in years under his watch.",
      "Inflation hit a record 54% in December 2022 and the country was forced to take a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund after government debt soared.",
      "In response to the criticism, Bawumia has said the economic management team he headed had no \"decision-making powers\" and that it merely provided advice to the government.",
      "But for many, this wasn't good enough.",
      "\"In terms of character, in terms of integrity, people started questioning themselves: 'What is this? How did it end up here? We thought you were the best guy, and look at where we've ended up',\" Franklin Cudjoe, a Ghanaian political commentator and head of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, told the BBC.",
      "Along with his role as an economist, Bawumia has also built the reputation of being a digital visionary.",
      "Ghana's digital ecosystem has seen \"significant growth\" especially in areas such as mobile phone connectivity, Charles Abani, head of the United Nations team in Ghana, remarked last month.",
      "This \"remarkable digital transformation\" was \"spearheaded\" by Bawumia, news website African Business reported, while Ghanaian newspaper The Chronicle hailed Bawumia's \"expertise in global digital transformation\".",
      "Bawumia said he initiated a partnership between Ghana's government and US-based company Zipline, which led to the creation of the world's largest vaccine delivery network.",
      "He said he reached out to Zipline, which uses drones to fly health products to hard-to-reach clinics, after his father died from a loss of blood.",
      "Although this passion for technology is celebrated by some, others are more sceptical.",
      "Mr Cudjoe said Bawumia has been campaigning on digitalisation rather than confronting debates about the government's handling of the economy.",
      "\"Whether Bawumia was in power or not, digitalisation was bound to happen in this country because we had already started it anyway,\" Mr Cudjoe said.",
      "Dr Sefa-Nyarko said of Bawumia: \"What he has been very successful at is to push and also claim all credit for digitalisation outcomes of the current government.\"",
      "Bawumia's personal life has also been a strength in his presidential campaign. His wife of 20 years, Samira, is a former beauty queen who is widely admired for her chic outfits.",
      "The Second Lady is also vocal when it comes to party politics - and has embarked on campaign tours for the NPP.",
      "The couple have four children together. They are proud followers of Islam - a religion practised by roughly one in five Ghanaians.",
      "Most people in Ghana are Christians but there is not much evidence that coming from a religious minority will hinder Bawumia's election chances, Dr Sefa-Nyarko said.",
      "The NPP has given its \"full support\" to Bawumia's candidacy, \"his Muslim faith notwithstanding\", Dr Sefa-Nyarko added.",
      "\"This could translate into widespread support across the country as well.\"",
      "Bawumia's geographical identity might be of greater consequence than his religion. The vice-president hails from northern Ghana, which is one of the NDC's strongest political bases.",
      "By choosing Bawumia as its presidential candidate, the NPP will be hoping to make inroads in the north, while retaining support in its heartland in the south.",
      "Bawumia has been traversing north, south, east and west in what he calls the \"possibilities bus\", a blue and red campaign vehicle emblazoned with the slogan \"it is possible\".",
      "To some, he is the face of economic mismanagement, but the vice-president retains some of the optimism he held when he was a 44-year-old embarking on an eight-year battle for power.",
      "\"I have the courage to accept when things do not go as well as planned,\" he told voters in his manifesto.",
      "\"But I also have a mindset of possibilities, and faith in ourselves, that we can rise and achieve great things in our lifetime.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:30:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Having built a $20bn oil refinery, Aliko Dangote is now at the heart of a row in the murky industry.",
    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:13:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Indians are being stripped of their life savings by savvy scammers putting them under \"digital arrest\".",
    "story": [
      "For a harrowing week in August, Ruchika Tandon, a 44-year-old neurologist at one of India\u2019s top hospitals, was ensnared in what felt like a high-stakes federal crime investigation.",
      "Yet, it was an elaborate scam - a web of deceit spun by scammers who manipulated her every move and drained her and her family\u2019s life savings.",
      "Under the pretence of \u201cdigital arrest\u201d- a term fabricated by her perpetrators - Dr Tandon was coerced to take leave from work, surrender her daily freedoms, and comply with nonstop surveillance and instructions from strangers on the phone, who convinced her she was at the centre of a grave investigation.",
      "The \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officials on video calls, threatening victims with arrest over fake charges, and pressuring them to transfer large sums of money.",
      "In Dr Tandon's case, they stripped her and her family of nearly 25m rupees ($300,000; \u00a3235,000) across bank accounts, mutual funds, pension funds, and life insurance  - years of savings lost in a manufactured nightmare.",
      "She is not alone. Indians lost over 1,200m rupees to \u201cdigital arrest\u201d hoaxes between January and April this year, according to official figures. These figures only scratch the surface, as many victims don\u2019t report such crimes. Stolen funds are often funnelled into overseas accounts or cryptocurrency wallets. More than 40% of the scams have been traced back to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, according to officials.",
      "Things are so bad that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the scam in his monthly radio talk in October.",
      "\"Whenever you receive such a call, don\u2019t be scared. You should be aware that no investigative agency ever inquires like this through a phone call or a video call,\" he said.",
      "India faces a range of cyber crimes, from fake investment and trading to dating scams. But the \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam stands out as especially elaborate and sinister - meticulously planned, relentless, and invasive to every part of a victim's life.",
      "Sometimes scammers reveal themselves during video calls, while other times they remain hidden, relying solely on audio. The plot could be straight out of an outlandish Bollywood thriller - except it is carefully choreographed.",
      "On that fateful first day, scammers posing as officials from India\u2019s telecom regulator called Lucknow-based Dr Tandon, claiming her number would be disconnected due to \u201c22 complaints\u201d of harassing messages sent from it.",
      "Moments later, a man claiming to be a senior police officer took over. He accused her of using a joint bank account with her mother to launder money for women and child trafficking.",
      "In the background, a jarring chorus of voices echoed, \u201cArrest her, arrest her!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe police will be coming in five minutes to arrest you. All police stations have been alerted,\u201d the man warned.",
      "\u201cI was angry and frustrated. I kept saying this can\u2019t be true,\u201d Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "The officer seemed to soften, but with a catch. He said India\u2019s federal detective agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), would take over as it was a \u201cmatter of national secrecy\".",
      "\u201cI will try to talk and persuade them not to put you in physical custody. But you have to be in digital custody,\u201d he insisted.",
      "Dr Tandon used a feature phone that lacked video calling, making it impossible for the scammers to proceed. So they forced her to drive to a store and buy a smartphone.",
      "Over the next six days, three men and a woman, posing as police officers and a judge, kept her under constant surveillance on Skype, with her phone camera running nonstop.",
      "They made her wake up her students at night to buy extra data packs to keep the scam going. She was required to place the phone throughout the house - while cooking, sleeping, and even outside the bathroom - tracking her every move.",
      "She was also forced to lie to her hospital and relatives, claiming she was too ill to work or meet anyone. When an uncle visited, they ordered her to hide under a bed, with the phone camera running.",
      "For a full week, Dr Tandon endured more 700 questions on her life and work, a staged trial, falsified court documents, and promises of a digital \u201cbail\u201d in exchange for her life savings. In the fake court she was ordered to dress in white to \u201cshow respect to the judge\". The callers had switched off their video, leaving only their fake names and authentic-looking badges displayed on blank screens.",
      "At one point, during the ordeal, the scammers even talked to Dr Tandon\u2019s 70-year-old mother, urging her to stay silent \"for her daughter\u2019s sake\".",
      "When the doctor repeatedly broke down on camera, the scammers told her: \u201cTake a deep breath and relax. You have not committed a murder. You have just laundered money.\"",
      "In a desperate bid for freedom, she transferred her entire savings from half-a-dozen different bank accounts to accounts controlled by the scammers, believing she would be refunded after \u201cgovernment verification\". Instead, she lost everything. The callers disconnected the line after transfer was completed.",
      "Back at work after a week, exhaustion drove Dr Tandon to search terms like \u201cdigital custody\u201d and \u201cnew CBI investigation methods\u201d on the internet.",
      "This led to newspaper stories detailing similar \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scams across the country. She still had refused to accept she was a victim of an elaborate hoax, and had rushed to the police station, hoping that \u201cthe police station and officers were real\u201d.",
      "Dr Tandon says she approached the police station, anxious.",
      "\"I've been receiving strange calls for days,\" she started, trying to explain.",
      "Before she could say more, a woman officer interrupted sharply, \"Have you transferred any money?\"",
      "At another police station, \"the moment they heard my case, they began laughing\", Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "\"This is very common now,\u201d a policeman said.",
      "Over 500km (310 miles) away in Delhi, author and journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay narrowly escaped the scam in July.",
      "He endured 28 hours under \"digital arrest,\" as scammers claimed that his defunct bank account had been used to launder money. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s suspicions aroused when a caller asked him why he hadn't redeemed his mutual funds - not a question a police officer would usually ask on the phone.",
      "Mr Mukhopadhyay slipped from his study, where scammers were surveilling him on his desktop, and confided briefly with his wife. Friends, alerted by his message, quickly asked her to disconnect his modem, freeing him from their grip.",
      "\"I became a digital slave until my friends exposed the scam,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"I had moved my funds into my account, ready to transfer it all to them. I felt like a fool when it was over.\u201d",
      "Progress on catching these scammers remains unclear, with many victims frustrated by slow moving complaint processes.",
      "Dr Tandon, however, has seen some success: police have arrested 18 suspects, including a woman, from across India. About a third of the stolen money has been recovered in cash and seized in different bank accounts.  She has received only 1.2m of the 25m rupees of her looted money so far \u2013 that was the cash recovered.",
      "Investigating officer Deepak Kumar Singh says the scammers were running an elaborate operation.",
      "\"The scammers are educated men and women - fluent in English and various Indian languages - including engineering graduates, cyber security experts, and banking professionals. Most operate through Telegram channels,\" Mr Singh, a senior police official, told the BBC.",
      "The scammers were clever, using targeted information from their victims' social media, investigators believe.",
      "\"They track you, gather personal information, and identify your weaknesses,\" says Mr Singh. \"Then they strike quickly, using a hit-and-run approach with potential victims.\"",
      "The scammers knew Mr Mukhopadhyay was a journalist and writer - author of a biography on Prime Minister Modi. They knew Dr Tandon was a doctor and had attended a conference in Goa. They had their biometric national identity numbers. Mr Mukhopadhyay wonders if they were aware he was among the journalists whose house was raided by Delhi police in October 2023 as part of an investigation into the funding of NewsClick (Critics had deplored the move as an attack on press freedom, a charge the government denied.)",
      "They also made errors. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s caller was unaware of how long it typically took to redeem funds, which raised his suspicions. Dr Tandon\u2019s fake judge, called himself Judge Dhananjay and displayed a fake insignia with a picture of the recently retired Chief Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud. Yet, overwhelmed by the moment, she missed the clue.",
      "Dr Tandon says she still lives in a haze, struggling to separate reality from the nightmare that overtook her life. Even when she filed the police complaint, she wondered, \u201cWas the police station also fake?\u201d",
      "Every phone call stirs fresh anxiety.",

      "Komal\u2019s morning view was of jagged, forbidding mountains, the rush of the river dozens of metres below the family home on the cliff. That was until the water became a torrent and tore the ground away beneath their feet.",
      "\u201cIt was a sunny day,\u201d says Komal, 18.",
      "For generations, her family had lived among the orchards and green lands in the heart of the Hunza valley in the Karakorum mountains of Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan region.",
      "\u201cIn the morning everything was normal, I went to school,\u201d Komal says, \u201cbut then my teacher told me that Hassanabad bridge had collapsed.\u201d",
      "Upstream, a glacial lake had formed, then suddenly burst - sending water, boulders and debris cascading down the valley and gathering speed. The ground trembled so violently some people thought there was an earthquake.",
      "When the torrent hit the cement bridge that connected the two parts of the village, it turned it to rubble.",
      "\u201cBy the time I came home, people were taking what they could out of their home,\u201d Komal says. She grabbed books, laundry, anything she could carry, but remembers thinking that with their house so far above the water there was no way it could be affected.",
      "That was until they received a phone call from the other side of the valley; their neighbours could see that the water was stripping away the hillside their home stood on.",
      "Then the homes began to collapse.",
      "\u201cI remember my aunt and uncle were still inside their home when the flood came and washed out the whole kitchen,\u201d she says. The family made it to safe ground, but their homes disappeared over the edge.",
      "Today, walking through the grey rubble and dust, there are still coat hooks on the wall, a few tiles in the bathroom, a window with the glass long gone. It\u2019s been two years, but nothing has grown on the crumbling cliff that used to be Komal's garden in Hassanabad.",
      "\u201cThis used to be all a green place,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I visit this place I remember my childhood memories, the time I spent here. But the barren places, they hurt me, they make me feel sad.\u201d",
      "Climate change is altering the landscape across Gilgit-Baltistan and neighbouring Chitral, researchers say. This is just part of an area referred to by some as the Third Pole; a place which has more ice than any other part of the world outside the polar regions.",

      "According to the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), more than 48,000 people across Gilgit Baltistan and Chitral are considered to be at high risk from a lake outburst or landslide. Some, like the village of Badswat in the neighbouring district of Ghizer, are in such peril they are being evacuated entirely to relative safety, their homes rendered impossible to live in.",
      "\u201cClimate change has increased the intensity and frequency of disasters across the region,\u201d says Deedar Karim, programme co-ordinator for the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat.",
      "\u201cThese areas are highly exposed. With the increase in temperature, there are more discharges (of water) and then more flooding. It\u2019s causing damage to infrastructure, houses, agricultural lands; every infrastructure has been damaged by these increasing floods.",
      "\u201cThe rainfall pattern is changing. The snowfall pattern is changing and then the melting of the glacier is changing. So it\u2019s changing the dynamics of hazards.\u201d",

      "There are other mitigation measures across the region; stone and wire barriers to try to slow floodwater, systems to monitor glacier melt, rainfall and water levels, speakers installed in villages to warn the community if danger looks likely. But many who work here say they need more resources.",
      "\u201cWe have installed early warning systems in some valleys,\u201d says Mr Ahmed. \u201cThese were identified by the Pakistan Meteorological Department and they gave us a list of around 100 valleys. But because of limited resources, we are only able to intervene in 16.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 01:09:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Citizen activists are taking unusual steps to push authorities for better pedestrian infrastructure.",
    "story": [
      "In India, if you ask a pedestrian how many obstacles they've encountered on a footpath, they may not be able to count them - but they'll certainly tell you that most footpaths are in poor condition.",
      "This is what Arun Pai says he learnt when he started asking people about their experience walking on the streets of his city, Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), in southern India.",
      "This month he set up a \"fun challenge\" - called the 'world's longest footpath run' - which invited people to walk or jog on an 11km (8 miles) stretch of footpath and make a note of all the obstacles they encountered, like hawkers, garbage or broken slabs of concrete. Next, they were asked to rate the footpath on a scale of one to five.",
      "\"When you have specifics, it gets easier to ask the authorities to take action. Instead of telling your local politician \"the footpaths are bad\", you can ask him or her \"to fix specific spots on a street,\" Mr Pai says.",
      "Mr Pai, who is the founder of Bangalore Walks, a non-profit that promotes walking, is among several citizen activists who are pushing to make the country's roads more pedestrian-friendly.",
      "In India's capital, a tour company called Delhi by Cycle has been advocating for making the city more cycle-friendly and walkable. These walking-enthusiasts are holding awareness walks, building walking apps and lobbying with politicians to make a change.",
      "Even in India's biggest cities, proper footpaths are few and far between and they are often overrun by hawkers and shops, parked vehicles and even cattle. In some places, they double up as homes for the poor.",
      "Even footpaths that exist are often not built to standard or properly maintained. Navigating roads on foot through crowds and traffic can be a nightmare.",
      "Last month, Walking Project, a citizen's group in India's financial capital, Mumbai, released a 'pedestrian manifesto' ahead of Maharashtra state elections to highlight the poor condition of the city's roads and encourage local politicians to take action.",
      "The manifesto included demands for better parking, designated hawking zones, pedestrian-friendly corridors on arterial roads and to make footpaths more accessible to those with mobility challenges.",
      "\"Government statistics show that almost 50% of the city's population relies on walking, which is far greater than the 11% that uses private transport and the combined 15% that uses tuk-tuks and buses,\" says Vendant Mhatre, convener of Walking Project.",
      "\"And yet, pedestrians are the most ignored group of users when it comes to framing policies around transport or road safety,\" he adds.",
      "According to the latest government estimates on road accidents, pedestrian fatalities were the second-highest after those of two-wheeler riders. In 2022, over 10,000 pedestrians lost their lives on national highways across the country, with around 21,000 more sustaining injuries in accidents.",
      "\"Authorities often resort to band-aid solutions like adding speed bumps or a signal to curb road accidents. But what is really needed is inter-connected footpaths that can accommodate high footfall,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Studies have found that addressing the problems of this forgotten group of road users can reap benefits for multiple stakeholders.",
      "In 2019, researchers in the southern city of Chennai studied the impact the construction of new footpaths on 100km (62 miles) of the city's streets had on the environment, economy and the health and safety of citizens.",
      "They found that the new footpaths encouraged 9% to 27% of the surveyed respondents to walk instead of using motorized transport, which led to a reduction in greenhouse gases and particulate matter. They also learned that the footpaths provided new opportunities for women and lower-income groups, helping them save money as well.",
      "The survey highlighted how people with disabilities and women might have nuanced requirements from footpaths and that tailoring improvements to meet their needs could enhance accessibility and equity.",
      "\"Very often, people don't have a benchmark for footpath quality, especially if they haven't travelled abroad or been exposed to places that have good facilities for pedestrians,\" Mr Mhatre says. He reasons that that's why there isn't enough outrage about the quality or absence of footpaths in the country.",
      "He also points out that most people see walking as an activity performed for leisure or exercise. And so, the infrastructure they associate with walking stops at gardens or walking tracks. In reality, however, people walk to various destinations daily, so the scope of walking infrastructure is far broader.",
      "\"Walking is the most economical and environment-friendly way to navigate one's city and it's high time our leaders paid as much attention to walking infrastructure as they do to public transport,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Geetam Tiwari, a professor of civil engineering, says that the main problem is that too much focus is given to solving the problem of car congestion on roads.",
      "\"To improve the flow of traffic, authorities often narrow down footpaths or eliminate them entirely,\" she says. Ms Tiwari says that this approach is problematic because doing so makes it difficult for pedestrians to access public transport systems, like buses and metros, which can take the pressure off the roads.",
      "\"It might seem counter-intuitive, but allowing the congestion to persist and focussing on improving infrastructure for pedestrians will help solve the traffic problem in the long run,\" she says.",
      "Ms Tiwari also says that the federal government should make it mandatory for states to implement the guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress -  a national organisation that lays down designing standards for roads and highways.",
      "She says that cities can also implement their own Non-Motorised Transport Policy (NMTP) to create better infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.",
      "\"At the moment, only a handful of cities in India have experimented with a NMTP but its time more cities step up to the plate,\" she adds.",

      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",

    "title": "'I may not be human but I sing from my soul' - AI divides African musicians",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 01:13:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Some pioneers see it as opportunity but others fear the continent's creativity will be stripped for profit.",
    "story": [
      "Described as a virtual singer powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Mya Blue says: \"I am not the enemy, I am just a music lover exploring the different sounds of the world.\"",
      "Her Instagram account, where she makes this statement, has the tag line: \"I may not be human but I sing from my soul\" - and is the creation of Nigerian musician and producer Eclipse Nkasi.",
      "She features in his recently released remix of Joromi, a classic tune by the late Nigerian highlife artist Sir Victor Uwaifo.",
      "She and her creator want to calm the fears that many musicians the world over have about the impact of AI on the music industry.",
      "Earlier this year, for example, high-profile artists such as Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj called for a halt to the \"predatory\" use of AI tools which they say steal artists' voices.",
      "And given a lack of understanding about AI throughout Africa, and the fact that AI tends to rely on data sources collated in the West, there are concerns about how African music and cultural heritage will be affected.",
      "But there are many African artists and industry professionals who are excited about the possibilities this emerging technology offers.",
      "Indeed Nkasi says the fact that AI is in its infancy in Africa may be a boon for the continent.",
      "\"There is a huge threat, but just saying: 'Let\u2019s abolish AI' is not going to work - there are too many countries and people invested,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"The best thing we can do is figure out better ways to use it.\"",
      "The 33-year-old is determined to be that pioneer and last year also produced the continent\u2019s first AI-powered music album Infinite Echoes.",
      "Nkasi says he has intentionally taken a manual and creative approach to using AI in his music, primarily using it to generate samples.",
      "\"My biggest drive with AI is its application, finding healthy ways to apply it. With each project it was important to find something that it did that moved the needle forward,\" he says.",
      "But while Nkasi is happy to experiment with the new technology, some see it as a threat to African culture.",
      "For Kenyan musician and producer Tabu Osusa, it heralds the risk of cultural appropriation - with AI passing off African sounds without acknowledging their source.",
      "This is because AI is able to quickly create new compositions by learning from existing music.",
      "\"My problem with AI is the ownership. Once you have taken some music from Ghana or Nigeria, who owns that music? How would you find out where the original creators are and ensure they are credited? It\u2019s theft for me through the backroom,\" Osusa told the BBC.",
      "\"Due to unregulated sampling methods by musicians, AI will enable recording company moguls in the West to make colossal sums of money while leaving some creatives in African villages to languish in abject poverty.\"",
      "This fear is reflected in a report released last year by Creatives Garage, a Kenya-based arts platform which worked in collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation to study the impact of AI on the East African nation\u2019s creative communities.",
      "It revealed that most Kenyan musicians were anxious that AI could lead to others benefitting from their creativity, says Bukonola Ngobi, research consultant at Creatives Garage.",
      "The study also warned that AI\u2019s power to store data might sound the death knell for the culture around traditional music.",
      "One musician even questioned whether recording and storing traditional sounds for AI to replicate might be a disincentive for local artists to continue to learn traditional instruments, Ngobi says.",
      "Osusa goes even further: \"In Africa we mostly don\u2019t study music, we are born with it. We live it. It\u2019s very spiritual. Music in Africa is always alive. It\u2019s so dynamic. That shouldn\u2019t be taken away from us.\"",
      "Yet the report did show that for those with access to tech devices, AI not only provided creative music development but also the chance to develop cheaper marketing and design services.",
      "Although this would be no help for emerging artists from Africa\u2019s poorer communities - and might raise the barrier to pursuing a music career, warned Ngobi.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have a laptop to start off with or you\u2019re a musician in an environment where there is no internet connectivity then how will you participate?\" she told the BBC.",
      "For those wanting to innovate, one of the problems Africa faces is the lack of data from the continent to dictate algorithms. Searches are often shaped by Western biases which decrease the accuracy and quality of work produced by AI for African musicians.",
      "For example, when Nkasi created Mya Blue using AI, he faced issues with her imagery - the artist presents as a Gen Z American girl with blue hair.",
      "\"AI is very limited in how it understands and perceives my space,\" he says.",
      "But the Nigerian musician views this as an opportunity for human contribution: \"The limits we Africans experience with AI can be a good thing.",
      "\"One can argue that right now, while AI can\u2019t give the very detailed African sound, there\u2019s still room for the guy who can play it. So I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re really fighting for when we consider that a problem.\"",
      "Fellow Nigerian Emmanuel Ogala, the boss of AI-powered company Josplay, definitely sees the opportunities for Africa.",
      "His company uses AI models to collate detailed metadata and intelligence to create archives of the continent\u2019s diverse music heritage.",
      "\"African music is really complex and it\u2019s one of the most understudied types of music,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This was reflected at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, when South African musician Tyla won the award for the Best Afrobeats song for her hit Water.",
      "During her acceptance speech she hit out against the tendency of Western award bodies to group all African artists under the umbrella of \"Afrobeats\" - a genre of music more associated with Nigeria and West Africa.",
      "\"African music is so diverse,\" she said. \"It\u2019s more than just Afrobeats. I come from South Africa. I represent amapiano. I represent my culture.\"",
      "Ogala feels AI would address such homogenisation and benefit African musicians by revealing to the world more of the continent\u2019s cultural diversity.",
      "\"A lot of the academics we speak to have knowledge that is very specific about a very small area of African music. You have to build for an African audience taking note of how fragmented our listening culture is. You just cannot humanly do that,\" he says.",
      "As AI continues to develop, there is consensus among African music artists, producers and researchers that there needs to be better financing.",
      "\"We need investment in the data infrastructure for the opportunities it presents to really be leveraged by people,\" says Ngobi.",
      "Ogala agrees and says that raising funds to develop his digital archive AI tool is difficult.",
      "\"We, the founders, have been funding the project out of our pockets because of our belief in the industry. If we put in place the fundamental building blocks, the industry will be a lot more viable than it is now.\"",
      "Added to this are the uncertainties around copyright legislation written for a pre-AI era which will need to be renegotiated. Copyright is already a huge issue for African artists whose music is often pirated, sold and played on the continent without them earning anything.",
      "These challenges aside, there is a growing realisation that unless the African music industry embraces the new technology, it is in danger of losing control of its talent and heritage.",
      "And Nkasi\u2019s Mya Blue certainly has big ambitions.",
      "During a Q&A on her Instagram, replying to a question about whether she could win a Grammy, she said: \"Who knows. As an AI [artist], I don\u2019t dream of trophies, but of resonating with hearts through music. But wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see a virtual artist on that stage?\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:38:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A new China-backed megaport in Peru may create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",
      "They will be watching keenly to see what happens to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for review in July 2026, but will be subject to negotiations during 2025.",
      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",
      "Eric Farnsworth, vice-president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas, feels that there is still much goodwill towards the US in Latin America, but the region's \"massive needs\" are not being met by its northern neighbour.",
      "\"The US needs to up its game in the region, because people would choose it if there was a meaningful alternative to China,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Unlike many others, he sees some rays of hope from the incoming Trump administration, especially with the appointment of Marco Rubio as secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio has a real sense of a need to engage economically with the Western Hemisphere in a way that we just haven't done for a number of years,\" he says.",
      "But for successive US leaders, Latin America has been seen primarily in terms of illegal migration and illegal drugs. And with Trump fixated on plans to deport record numbers of immigrants, there is little indication that the US will change tack any time soon.",
      "Like the rest of the world, Latin America is bracing itself for a bumpy four years - and if the US and China start a full-blown trade war, the region stands to get caught in the crossfire.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:46:38 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study finds that caste plays a vital role in high rates of stunting in children in India.",
    "story": [
      "Decades of caste discrimination have contributed to India having higher levels of child stunting rates than across Sub-Saharan Africa, new research has revealed.",
      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",
      "In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version.",
      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",
      "\u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving.",
      "Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts.",
      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",

Normally, under any other circumstance, you would be looking at a tennis ball or two pieces of tape as a cross for your eyeline and imagining what's happening, but no, Ridley will place that in front of you and have it play,\" said Pascal. \"It's like nothing I've ever experienced before.

      "Jake Paul, a former child star and social media influencer who started boxing professionally in 2020, slugged it out with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Friday in a matchup that was livestreamed worldwide on Netflix. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",

      "Who do gamblers think will win the fight?",
      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings. That means a $100 wager on post-retirement Iron Mike will bring in a $160 profit if he wins. At -200, Paul is the favorite to win. Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

    "summary": "He's earned critical acclaim and award nominations for performances in \"Aftersun\" and \"Normal People.\" Now, Irish actor Paul Mescal, who's become a Gen Z heartthrob, is front-and-center of Ridley Scott's epic \"Gladiator II.\"",
    "story": [
      "Walking through the streets of Dublin, Paul Mescal said, \"There's this weird sensation about landing into the city \u2013 I don't know, it just makes me feel calm.\"",
      "The Irish actor was not going to get much of that calm on this stop, attending the Dublin premiere of \"Gladiator II.\" He was here to promote the highly-anticipated film. \"There's a little bit of really enjoying it, but part of it also hanging on for dear life,\" he said. \"Just the size is something that I haven't experienced before. I also just haven't led a huge amount of films.\"",
      "In \"Gladiator II,\" he plays Lucius, who learns (along with the audience) of his connection to Russell Crowe's character from the original 2000 blockbuster. Nearly 25 years later, director Ridley Scott is back with the sequel, out this week.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Gladiator II\" click on the video player below:",
      "What was it like for Mescal to be in the middle of such an epic film? \"I would say equally epic,\" he replied.",
      "The 28-year-old has already been nominated for an Oscar, playing a single dad in \"Aftersun,\" and an Emmy for his role in \"Normal People.\" Aside from the critical acclaim, that series turned him into a Gen Z heartthrob practically overnight.",
      "Ridley Scott says he was so impressed with Mescal that he cast the young actor after just a 30-minute zoom call.",
      "\"I got a phone call and they were like, 'You're going to be in \"Gladiator II,\"'\" Mescal recalled. \"That's kind of massively life-altering news to receive.\"",
      "It's that big? \"Yeah, of course it is,\" Mescal said. \"I think there's something that comes with the legacy of Ridley Scott.\"",
      "The first \"Gladiator\" won five Academy Awards, including best picture. In this incarnation, from Paramount Pictures (a division of CBS' parent company), Mescal stars alongside Denzel Washington.",
      "I asked, \"As an actor, are you taking mental notes when you work with someone like Washington?\"",
      "\"When you go back to bed in the evening, you're like, 'How is he doing this? How is he doing that?'\" he replied. \"Every scene I did with him was never how I expected it to go, which is the dream. It was very thrilling to be five feet in front of his face watching him do that.\"",
      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",
      "\"The shorts?\"",
      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",
      "\"This is new for me,\" he said, of fame.",
      "\"But you're used to attention at this point?\"",
      "\"Uh, within reason.\"",
      "On campus, at times this star was as struck as the students.",
      "Mescal is hoping to maintain some distance, some mystery as an actor, to be able to convincingly inhabit such varied roles. \"You don't want an audience to know you innately,\" he said.",
      "And what is his relationship with fame? \"Ever-changing,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps that's because it's all changing so quickly for him. Instead of dispersing during our interview inside, the crowd, we soon discovered, had multiplied. And we got to witness Paul Mescal in a role for which there is no rehearsal, and no script.",
      "\"What the hell?\" he remarked to the assembled hordes. \"I don't know what to say other than, hello! This is f*****g bananas! I have to go finish an interview \u2026 you should all go back to school. See you later!\"",

It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT) on Netflix. There were three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul were set to enter the ring. The main event will occur once those bouts have concluded with the exact timing dependent on the length of the preceding fights.",
      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 07:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Officials suspect that migratory birds likely spread the H5N1 virus there.",
    "story": [
      "Authorities in Hawaii are warning residents who attended a local pet fair to watch for symptoms of avian influenza after a local flock of ducks and other birds tested positive for the H5N1 virus that has fueled a global outbreak of infections.",
      "Officials suspect wild migrating birds are likely to blame for the first known infection of a flock in Hawaii, which had been the last state in the country with no reported cases in poultry or wild birds during the current outbreak.",
      "Sequencing done by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's national lab in Iowa confirmed the infection, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "The specific genotype of the virus that infected the birds is known as A3, said Lyndsay Cole, a spokesperson for the federal Animal Plant Health Inspection Services.",
      "This is different from the B3.13 genotype that has been fueling this year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy and poultry farms and suggests the virus spilled over into the flock in Hawaii from migrating wild birds.",
      "Investigators have not turned up any links so far between the flock and imported animals or travel, a spokesperson for Hawaii's Agriculture Department said. The island has \"strict importing regulations for birds and other animals,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "All the infected birds were housed at the same site, though investigations are ongoing to root out other potential cases. The birds were also not symptomatic until several days after the fair, the state Health Department said, lowering the risk to humans.",
      "\"As the birds were not showing signs of infection at the time of the fair, the likelihood of spreading H5N1 to humans is low. However, out of an abundance of caution, DOH recommends that individuals who attended the fair and touched a duck or goose monitor for influenza-like illness (ILI) and conjunctivitis,\" the state said in a release.",
      "A quarantine order was issued for the property where the birds lived and all will be required to be \"depopulated and the premises cleaned and disinfected,\" the state Agriculture Department said. An order was also issued to prevent any animals from being moved in or out of the site.",
      "At least 10 birds, which included ducks, a goose and a zebra dove, had been reported dead at the property on Nov. 12. Samples from the dead birds were sent to be tested for the virus.",
      "Closely watching for human cases",
      "Confirmation of the infected flock in Hawaii follows a detection of the virus in the area from wastewater samples collected by the state earlier this month.",
      "Health officials around the country have been closely watching for signs of H5N1 spreading in their communities amid mounting cases in humans across North America.",
      "At least 53 cases have been confirmed across seven states so far this year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0says. Most are linked to the B3.13 version of the virus that has been infecting workers at dairy farms and nearby poultry farms in recent months. None of them are known to have been severely ill.",
      "Health officials in Canada announced this month\u00a0that they had detected a case of H5N1 bird flu in a critically ill hospitalized teenager. That patient had been infected by the D1.1 genotype of H5N1, which is related to another ongoing poultry outbreak in British Columbia, the Canadian province where they lived.",
      "Experts say the virus that infected the teenager does appear to have some worrying mutations, which might explain why the case was more severe.",
      "\"The preliminary sequence from the H5N1 human case in British Columbia has been posted and it is not good news,\" Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, posted on Nov. 16.",
      "Genetic sequencing data from human cases so far in the U.S. have not found any signs of the virus mutating to spread more efficiently between humans or to be significantly more dangerous, the CDC says.",
      "But the agency also recently found evidence that several cases had been asymptomatic and gone undetected during the outbreak so far, prompting stepped up testing recommendations.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s concerns about the health effects of fluoride may already be helping some Americans \u2014 investors in dental services companies.",
      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:51:24 -0500",
    "summary": "There is currently no cure for Parkinson's Disease. But some with Parkinson's are finding that an unusual therapy \u2013 rock climbing \u2013 is helping them improve their balance, mobility, strength and cognition.",
    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",
      "Many of the climbers have become friends who climb together several times a week; and they've become a support group, Parkinson's Pals, who encourage each other.",
      "\"When I reach the top, I can turn around and look and wave, and see my wife and my friends, and that's the reward,\" said de Mulder. \"It's really wonderful.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",

    "summary": "Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014\u00a0 Arthur Frommer, whose \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" guidebooks revolutionized leisure travel by persuading average Americans to take budget vacations abroad, has died. He was 95.",
      "Frommer died from complications of pneumonia, his daughter Pauline Frommer said Monday.",
      "\"My father opened up the world to so many people,\" she said. \"He believed deeply that travel could be an enlightening activity and one that did not require a big budget.\"",
      "Frommer began writing about travel while serving in the U.S. Army in Europe in the 1950s. When a guidebook he wrote for American soldiers overseas sold out, he launched what became one of the travel industry's best-known brands, self-publishing \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day\" in 1957.",
      "\"It struck a chord and became an immediate best-seller,\" he recalled in an interview with The Associated Press in 2007, on the 50th anniversary of the book's debut.",
      "The Frommer's brand, led today by Pauline Frommer, remains one of the best-known names in the travel industry, with guidebooks to destinations around the world, an influential social media presence, podcasts and a radio show.",
      "Frommer's philosophy - stay in inns and budget hotels instead of five-star hotels, sightsee on your own using public transportation, eat with locals in small cafes instead of fancy restaurants - changed the way Americans traveled in the mid- to late 20th century. He said budget travel was preferable to luxury travel \"because it leads to a more authentic experience.\" That message encouraged average people, not just the wealthy, to vacation abroad.",
      "It didn't hurt that his books hit the market as the rise of jet travel made getting to Europe easier than crossing the Atlantic by ship.",
      "The books became so popular that there was a time when you couldn't visit a place like the Eiffel Tower without spotting Frommer's guidebooks in the hands of every other American tourist.",
      "Frommer's advice also became so standard that it's hard to remember how radical it seemed in the days before discount flights and backpacks.",
      "\"It was really pioneering stuff,\" Tony Wheeler, founder of the Lonely Planet guidebook company, said in an interview in 2013. Before Frommer, Wheeler said, you could find guidebooks \"that would tell you everything about the church or the temple ruin. But the idea that you wanted to eat somewhere and find a hotel or get from A to B -- well, I've got a huge amount of respect for Arthur.\"",
      "\"Arthur did for travel what Consumer Reports did for everything else,\" said Pat Carrier, former owner of The Globe Corner, a travel bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "The final editions of Frommer's groundbreaking series were titled \"Europe from $95 a Day.\"",
      "Frommer guides reborn",
      "The concept no longer made sense when hotels couldn't be had for less than $100 a night, so the series was discontinued in 2007. But the Frommer publishing empire didn't disappear, despite a series of sales that started when Frommer sold the guidebook company to Simon & Schuster. It was later acquired by Wiley Publishing, which in turn sold it to Google in 2012. Google quietly shut the guidebooks down, but Arthur Frommer - in a David vs. Goliath triumph - got his brand back from Google. In November 2013 with his daughter Pauline, he relaunched the print series with dozens of new guidebook titles.",
      "\"I never dreamed at my age I'd be working this hard,\" he told the AP at the time, age 84.",
      "Frommer also remained a well-known figure in 21st century travel, opinionated to the end of his career, speaking out on his blog and radio show.",
      "He hated mega-cruise ships and railed against travel websites where consumers put up their own reviews, saying they were too easily manipulated with phony posts. And he coined the phrase \"Trump Slump\" in a widely quoted column that predicted a slump in tourism to the U.S. after Donald Trump was elected president the first time.",
      "Depression-era roots",
      "Frommer was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, and grew up during the Great Depression in Jefferson City, Missouri, the child of a Polish father and Austrian mother. \"My father had one job after another, one company after another that went bankrupt,\" he recalled. The family moved to New York when he was a teenager. He worked as an office boy at Newsweek, went to New York University and was drafted upon graduating from Yale Law School in 1953. Because he spoke French and Russian, he was sent to work in Army intelligence at a U.S. base in Germany, where the Cold War was heating up.",
      "His first glimpse of Europe was from the window of a military transport plane. Whenever he had a weekend leave or a three-day pass, he'd hop a train to Paris or hitch a ride to England on an Air Force flight.",
      "Eventually, he wrote \"The GI's Guide to Traveling in Europe\" and, a few weeks before his Army stint was up, he had 5,000 copies printed by a typesetter in a German village. They were priced at 50 cents apiece and distributed by the Army newspaper, Stars & Stripes.",
      "Shortly after he returned to New York to practice law at the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, he received a cable from Europe. \"The book was sold out, would I arrange a reprint?\" he said.",
      "Soon after, he spent his month's vacation from the law firm doing a civilian version of the guide. \"In 30 days I went to 15 different cities, getting up at 4 a.m., running up and down the streets, trying to find good cheap hotels and restaurants,\" he recalled.",
      "The resulting book, the very first \"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\" was much more than a list. It was written with a wide-eyed wonder that verged on poetry: \"Venice is a fantastic dream,\" Frommer wrote. \"Try to arrive at night when the wonders of the city can steal upon you piecemeal and slow. ... Out of the dark, there appear little clusters of candy-striped mooring poles; a gondola approaches with a lighted lantern hung from its prow.\"",
      "Frommer eventually gave up law to write the guides full-time.",
      "Daughter Pauline joined him with his first wife, Hope Arthur, on their trips starting in 1965, when she was 4 months old. \"They used to joke that the book should be called 'Europe on Five Diapers a Day,'\" Pauline Frommer said.",
      "In the 1960s, when inflation forced Frommer to change the title of the book to \"Europe on 5 and 10 Dollars a Day,\" he said \"it was as if someone had plunged a knife into my head.\"",
      "Dispelling false impressions",
      "Asked to summarize the impact of his books in a 2017 Associated Press interview, he said that in the 1950s, \"most Americans had been taught that foreign travel was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, especially travel to Europe. They were taught that they were going to a war-torn country where it was risky to stay in any hotel other than a five-star hotel. It was risky to go into anything but a top-notch restaurant. ... And I knew that all these warnings were a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "He added: \"We were pioneers in also suggesting that a different type of American should travel, that you didn't have to be well-heeled.\"",
      "To the end of his life, he said he avoided traveling first class. \"I fly economy class and I try to experience the same form of travel, the same experience that the average American and the average citizen of the world encounters,\" he said.",
      "As Frommer aged, his daughter Pauline gradually became the force behind the company, promoting the brand, managing the business and even writing some of the content based on her own travels. Her relationship with her father was both tender and respectful, and she summed it up this way in a 2012 email to AP: \"It's wonderful to have a working partner whose mind is a steel trap and who doesn't just have smarts, but wisdom. His opinions, whether or not you agree with them, come from his social values. He's a man who puts ethics at the center of his life, and weaves them into everything he does.\"",
      "In addition to Pauline, Frommer's survivors include his second wife, Roberta Brodfeld, and four grandchildren.",

    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines, the airline of choice for many budget travelers, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, raising questions about the viability of no-frills airlines in the post-pandemic era, as consumer preferences shift toward more premium offerings.",
      "Customers with plans to fly on the airline over Thanksgiving and beyond are also concerned about what the filing means for their upcoming trips, as well as airfares generally.",
      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",
      "Additionally, Spirit customers can still benefit from the airline's Free Spirit loyalty program, as well as accrue and redeem Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms.",
      "Schedule modifications",
      "That said, industry experts advise customers to keep a close eye on their upcoming bookings. That includes updating their contact information so that the airline can reach them with modifications to their flights.",
      "\"Make sure your contact information is up to date, and keep an eagle eye on your reservations,\" Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy \u2014 a site focused on airline deals and travel rewards \u2014 told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There's no need to panic, Kelly said, but the airline is expected to trim its schedule, which could result in your flight time changing, or being canceled.",
      "\"They're not going to stop flying tomorrow, but inevitably they're going to emerge an even smaller airline after this process, so that means there are going to be some hiccups with routes,\" he said.",
      "Aviation industry consultant Robert Mann said some consumers who were accustomed to flying Spirit out of major airports may have to fly out of a smaller hub, as Spirit withdraws from major hubs served by legacy carriers.",
      "\"You could see that happen where Spirit decided to compete, and has now decided it wasn't such a good idea,\" he said.",
      "What will happen to airfares?",
      "Spirit and other low-cost carriers have helped depress airfares, even for consumers who don't fly on budget airlines.",
      "\"Whether you like them or not, having ultra low-cost carriers is good for our overall aviation ecosystem and good for consumers, even if you never buy them,\" Kelly said.",
      "Spirit will emerge a smaller airline, which means there will be fewer low-cost flights on most routes, and airfares could rise across the board.",
      "\"The smaller Spirit is and the less routes they serve, the less pressure there will be on other airlines in those markets, resulting in overall higher fares,\" Kelly said. \"This isn't good for consumers. There's no positive side to this.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 19:41:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The budget carrier Spirit Airlines is trying to recover from the pandemic drop in travel and failed mergers.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it's filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed attempts to sell itself to other carriers.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations it was unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "The move was widely expected.",
      "Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a \"prearranged, streamlined\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.",
      "The Chapter 11 process itself won't impact Spirit employee's wages or benefits, the airline said.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\"The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\" he told investors during an earnings call. \"We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\"",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They're just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they're paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit's red ink.",
      "It's not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded.",
      "What's been ailing Spirit",
      "There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit's costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit's budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit's core business \u2014 have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit's traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That was a huge change from Spirit's longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt pointed out to CBS News that, on one hand, some people \"are saying, 'You know what? I'm doing better than I thought financially and I can afford maybe to upgrade to an airline that has extra leg room or something like that.' And Spirit has missed that opportunity.\"",
      "On the other hand, Harteveldt notes, lots of Spirit's customers \"haven't been able to afford to fly to the same extent that they used to because of the higher cost of everyday living.\"",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines that are forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "Spirit said in an October regulatory filing that it had identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year, according to\u00a0CBS News Miami. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \"reduction in workforce,\" the Florida-based airline noted. The carrier also disclosed that it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million.",
      "Mergers didn't materialize",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "According to\u00a0KFF Health News, some studies have linked fluoride exposure among pregnant women to a higher risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and lower IQs, leading experts to call for further research.",
      "Fluoride is a mineral that keeps teeth healthy and reduces\u00a0cavities\u00a0by protecting them against bacteria that produces potentially damaging acid, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

      "Jake Paul, a former child star and social media influencer who started boxing professionally in 2020, slugged it out with former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Friday in a matchup that was livestreamed worldwide on Netflix. Paul won the fight by unanimous decision.",
      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",
      "Though promotors did not reveal exactly how much Tyson earned for Friday's fight, reports from online sources,\u00a0including DraftKings Network, estimate he'll make around $20 million.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, to fight 57-year-old Mike Tyson live on Netflix: \"Time to put Iron Mike to sleep\"",
      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",
      "Tyson would go on to earn $30 million for each of his next four matches, which included an infamous 1997 fight against Evander Holyfield in which Tyson bit off a piece of his opponent's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",
      "How much is Jake Paul getting paid for the fight?",
      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",

      "Tyson enters the ring on Friday, nearly 20 years since his last professional fight, as a +160 underdog,\u00a0according\u00a0to the latest betting odds from DraftKings.

Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:31:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Americans looking to purchase EVs may want to do so quickly, as the incoming administration is likely to axe a $7,500 tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "summary": "The Social Security Fairness Act, which would increase benefits for 2.8 million retirees, has bipartisan support but time running out.",
    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",

      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",

    "story": [
      "A mysterious diamond-laden necklace with possible links to a scandal that contributed to the downfall of Marie Antoinette, sold for $4.8 million at an auction in Geneva Wednesday.",
      "The 18th century jewel containing around 300 carats of diamonds had been estimated to sell at the Sotheby's Royal and Noble Jewels sale for $1.8-2.8 million.",
      "But after energetic bidding, the hammer price ticked in at 3.55 million Swiss francs ($4 million), and Sotheby's listed the final price after taxes and commissions at 4.26 million francs ($4.81 million).",
      "The unidentified buyer, who put in her bid over the phone, was \"ecstatic,\" Andres White Correal, chairman of the Sotheby's jewelry department, told AFP.",
      "\"She was ready to fight and she did,\" he said, adding that it had been \"an electric night.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a niche in the market for historical jewels with fabulous provenances... People are not only buying the object, but they're buying all the history that is attached to it,\" he said.",
      "Some of the diamonds in the piece are believed to stem from the jewel at the center of the \"Diamond Necklace Affair\" \u2014 a scandal in the 1780s that further tarnished the reputation of France's last queen, Marie Antoinette, and boosted support for the coming French Revolution.",
      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",
      "\"This spectacular antique jewel is an incredible survivor of history,\" it said in a statement prior to the sale.",

      "\"Spectacular piece of history\"",
      "Beyond that, little is known of the necklace, including who designed it and for whom it was commissioned, although the auction house believes that such an impressive antique jewel could only have been created for a royal family.",
      "Sotheby's said it was likely that some of the diamonds featured in the piece came from the famous necklace from the scandal that engulfed Marie Antoinette.",
      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",

    "title": "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, experts say.",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",
      "CEO Anne Wojcicki has said she intends to take the company private and is not considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",

      "Gaetz was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee and Justice Department, though federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against him last year. The Ethics panel was looking into allegations the former congressman engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other accusations. But Gaetz resigned his seat in the House last week after President-elect Donald Trump announced he had selected the Florida Republican to serve as his attorney general.",

      "The House Ethics Committee launched into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "In June, the Ethics Committee said \"certain allegations merit continued review\" after it issued more than two dozen subpoenas and spoke with more than a dozen witnesses. The panel said it was looking into claims Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",

He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "A lawyer for two women who spoke with the Ethics Committee told CBS News on Monday that they testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly for sex, and said Venmo transactions for the encounters were obtained by the panel.",
      "The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women told House investigators that Gaetz asked about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties via text messages, which was understood to be code for drugs. One of Leppard's clients testified before the Ethics Committee that she witnessed\u00a0 Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old against a game table during a July 2017 party, months after he was sworn in as a House member.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina introduced legislation Monday to change House rules to prohibit transgender women from using women's bathrooms and other facilities on Capitol Hill, a proposal that comes just before the House prepares to swear-in the first openly transgender member of Congress.",
      "Mace's two-page resolution would bar House members, officers and employees from using single-sex facilities in the Capitol or House office buildings that do not correspond with their biological sex. Her proposal claims that allowing biological males into women's restrooms, locker rooms and changing rooms \"jeopardizes the safety and dignity\" of female lawmakers, officers and Capitol Hill employees.",
      "The House sergeant-at-arms would be tasked with enforcing the measure, if approved.",
      "The South Carolina Republican's legislation appears to target Rep.-elect Sarah McBride of Delaware, who became the first openly transgender person elected to Congress when she won the race for the state's only House seat two weeks ago.",
      "McBride called Mace's resolution a \"blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing. We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",
      "But Mace attacked the \"radical left\" and claimed they are \"trying to erase women.\"",
      "\"Sarah McBride doesn't get a say in this,\" Mace said. \"This is a biological man trying to force himself into women's spaces, and I'm not going to tolerate.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged on Tuesday that the issue of restroom access for transgender lawmakers is one the lower chamber has not confronted before, but told reporters that the House would address it \"in deliberate fashion with member consensus on it, and we will accommodate the needs of every single person.\"",
      "Johnson said he would not \"engage in silly debates\" when asked whether McBride is a man or a woman.",
      "\"We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people,\" Johnson said. \"I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, and we will, and I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this.\"",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",
      "The seven-week trial ended with his conviction. The jury deliberated for less than two days.",
      "After hearing guilty 34 times, Trump turned around, clasped his son Eric's hand for a moment, and walked out of the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors were still packing their briefcases as Trump's voice could be heard from just beyond the doors.",
      "He was decrying the case, and campaigning for a return to the White House.",

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. (KDKA) \u2014 The House task force investigating the July 13\u00a0assassination attempt\u00a0on President-elect Donald Trump issued subpoenas on Monday to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for testimony from two ATF employees regarding the response to the Butler, Pennsylvania, shooting.",

Since then, Trump won the presidential election and will be headed to the White House in January.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 11:35:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has selected for some of the top roles in his administration controversial picks who may not win universal support from Republican senators. He can only afford to lose a few Republicans in the confirmation process, but he's opened the door to the possibility of forgoing the traditional route altogether, utilizing a Constitutional power known as recess appointments to effectively bypass the Senate \u2014 and swiftly approve his nominees.",
      "The possible strategy, raised by Trump in a post on social media last week, has generated mixed reviews among senators, who would stand to forfeit their key advice and consent role. And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

Matt Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, two sources told CBS News.",
      "The movements of the Ethics panel have been under heightened scrutiny since President-elect Donald Trump announced last week that he had selected Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The Florida Republican resigned his seat in the House in the wake of the announcement, which ended the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz since he is now a former member.",
      "The Ethics Committee declined to comment on the upcoming meeting. The panel was supposed to meet Friday to vote on releasing the report, but Trump tapped Gaetz for the nation's top law enforcement officer days earlier. The committee then postponed its meeting.",
      "Gaetz must win Senate confirmation to serve as attorney general, and senators have been calling to see the Ethics Committee's report as they weigh whether to approve his nomination.

      "\"I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,\" she told reporters Monday. \"There is precedent for releasing even after a member has resigned.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 21:45:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that Matt Gaetz paid them \"for sex,\" their lawyer told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
    "story": [
      "Two women interviewed by the House Ethics Committee about former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly in Venmo transactions \"for sex,\" and that those transactions were obtained by the committee, an attorney for the women told CBS News. The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women testified that Gaetz inquired in text messages about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties, which was understood to be code for drugs.",
      "Leppard, who is based in Orlando, said his clients testified that they attended parties from 2017 to January 2019 where Gaetz was present and sex and drug use took place. In an interview Monday with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, Leppard said one of his clients testified before the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl against a game table at a July 2017 party. Gaetz was sworn into Congress in January 2017, so all of the events the women allege took place while he was a member of the House.",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing, including having sex with a minor. After CBS News published its initial\u00a0story and it aired on \"CBS Evening News,\" Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer said in a statement, \"Matt Gaetz will be the next Attorney General. He's the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system. These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration.\"",
      "\"The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing,\" Pfeiffer added, \"The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz.\" Federal prosecutors did investigate Gaetz but ended the probe in 2023 without filing charges.",
      "As the House Ethics Committee weighs whether to release its report, which investigated allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and bribery, Leppard said his clients want the public to know they are telling the truth.",
      "One of his clients said in a text to Leppard, \"'Regardless of how many times he tries to distract from the truth, the public deserves to know that what we all experienced was real and actually happened.'\"",
      "\"My clients are not political; they didn't vote in the last two elections \u2014 they don't care one way or another,\" Leppard told Garrett. \"But they do want the public to know that they are not lying. They did not come forward willingly \u2014 they have never spoken to anyone without a force of a legal subpoena.\"",
      "He continued, \"And if the American people would know, then they could decide if that's the person they want to be the next attorney general.\"",
      "One of Leppard's clients is among at least four women who have told the committee they were paid to attend parties with drugs and sex where Gaetz was present, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Her account corroborates the testimony of the then-minor, who told the committee that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old.",
      "At the July 2017 party where his client alleges this occurred, Leppard said she and others were \"at the party in order to provide entertainment, to be happy, to be lively and provide sexual favors for the gentlemen that were present.\"",
      "\"The expectation was that they would have sexual intercourse,\" Leppard said his clients testified about these parties. \"They testified to the House that \u2014 and the House actually had their Venmo transactions, PayPal transactions, of Representative Gaetz.\"",
      "Leppard said the House panel asked the women about Gaetz's PayPal and Venmo transactions.",
      "\"'What was this for? What was this for,'\" Leppard said his clients were asked.",
      "\"'This was for sex,'\" he said they responded. \"'This was for sex. This was for sex.'\"",
      "Leppard said the payments were typically between $200 and $500 at a time.",
      "He said his clients also testified that sometimes, someone other than Gaetz would make a payment on his behalf. On at least one occasion, according to Leppard, that was Nestor Galban, a Cuban immigrant who is close to Gaetz and whom Gaetz has referred to as his \"son.\" He said other payments on Gaetz's behalf were made by Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg, who was convicted in 2022 of sex trafficking of a minor and other crimes.",
      "Leppard said his client who testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with the 17-year-old also told the panel she did not believe Gaetz was aware of her age at the time.",
      "\"My client, at least, testified that he did not know her age,\" Leppard said.",
      "Leppard's client testified that she knew the 17-year-old girl and her age, and said the two attended high school together.",
      "His client testified that she had sex with Gaetz after arriving at the July 2017 house party. Later during the party, his client testified, she was walking outside when she saw Gaetz having sex with her friend, the 17-year-old, against the gaming table.",
      "Leppard said one of his clients provided more than 100 texts involving Gaetz to the committee. Frequently, Leppard said, the texts his client provided showed Gaetz would have to be reminded to pay.",
      "\"There was a lot of texts requesting payment, like, 'Hey, when are you going to pay me?'\" Leppard said. \"Or, 'I don't want to be that girl, but can you please go ahead and pay me what we agreed upon?' Text messages along those lines. The texts the House was more interested in was the ones where Representative Gaetz was seemingly requesting that drugs be present.\"",
      "\"So, in my line of work as a criminal defense attorney, no one ever requests, 'Can you give me some drugs, please?'\" Leppard said. \"They usually use code words. And so Representative Gaetz would use terms like, 'Can you make sure that there are party favors present?' Or, 'Who's in charge of party favors?' He used the term 'party favor mecca' when he was referring to another individual who was bringing party favors. He also used the term 'vitamins,' I believe.\"",
      "Still, Leppard's clients told the House panel they could not specifically recall whether they had seen Gaetz use marijuana or other drugs.",
      "The texts also included a \"lot of positive emojis,\" Leppard said, like hearts, and \"positive statements\" back and forth between Gaetz, his clients and others. Leppard characterized the relationship with Gaetz as a complicated one, but also one of friendship, and he also told Garrett that his clients knew Gaetz's girlfriend at the time.",
      "\"At least one of my clients testified that, in a sense, they were required to please Mr. Gaetz before going out and attending their [Electronic Dance Music] show,\" Leppard said of one alleged occasion about which his client testified. \"And that was something that was of particular interest to the House. Representative Gaetz's girlfriend texted them, and they essentially took care of their duties, and later on, they went to see their show.\"",
      "Leppard said his clients have \"been through heck\" and are worried that if they testify before the Senate or anywhere else publicly, \"they might not be safe in their jobs.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee had planned to vote Friday, Nov. 15, on releasing its report, but the meeting was canceled after Trump announced his intention Wednesday to nominate Gaetz, and then a few hours later, the Florida Republican abruptly resigned from Congress. The panel is now set to meet Wednesday, two sources told CBS News.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday he would \"strongly request\" that the House Ethics Committee withhold the report on its investigation into Gaetz. The committee has equal representation among Democrats and Republicans \u2014 five Democrats and five Republicans.",
      "Democratic and Republican senators who would vote on Gaetz's confirmation as attorney general have said they want access to the ethics panel's report.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he is naming former Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy as his nominee for transportation secretary, as he continues to roll out picks for his Cabinet.",
      "Duffy is a former reality TV star who was one of Trump's most visible defenders on cable news \u2014 a prime concern for the media-focused president-elect. Duffy served in the House for nearly nine years, was a member of the Financial Services Committee and chairman of the subcommittee on insurance and housing. He left Congress in 2019, and is co-host of \"The Bottom Line\" on Fox Business.",
      "In his announcement, Trump noted that Duffy is married to a Fox News host, calling him \"the husband of a wonderful woman, Rachel Campos-Duffy, a STAR on Fox News.\"",
      "Duffy is so far the second Fox-affiliated television host that Trump has named to his Cabinet. Trump last week announced his choice of Fox News host Pete Hegseth to serve as his defense secretary.",
      "Trump said Duffy would use his experience and relationships built over the years in Congress \"to maintain and rebuild our Nation's Infrastructure, and fulfill our Mission of ushering in The Golden Age of Travel, focusing on Safety, Efficiency, and Innovation. Importantly, he will greatly elevate the Travel Experience for all Americans!\"",
      "Duffy in 2022 ruled out a run for Wisconsin governor despite pleas from Trump to make a bid, saying he needed to care for his nine children, including his youngest child who had a heart condition.",
      "He is a former lumberjack athlete and frequent Fox News contributor. He was featured on MTV's \"The Real World: Boston\" in 1997. He met his wife on the set of MTV's \"Road Rules: All Stars\" in 1998.",
      "A reality television background before politics is not unusual in Trump's world. The former president launched his political career after his hit reality show, \"The Apprentice.\"",
      "Duffy, after his time on reality television, worked as a special prosecutor and Ashland County district attorney. He won election to Congress as part of a tea party wave in 2010.",
      "When he first ran for office, Duffy was largely considered an underdog but attracted national attention for his campaign ads, in which he donned a red flannel shirt and chopped trees. He told voters he came from a \"long line of lumberjacks\" and would bring his axe to Washington.",

      "The Transportation Department oversees the nation's complex transportation system, including pipelines, railroads, cars, trucks, the airlines and mass transit systems as well as federal funding for highways.",
      "If confirmed, Duffy would take over at a time of tremendous change, especially on the nation's highways. Traffic deaths remain near record highs at a time when new technologies are being introduced that could help make the roads safer. Multiple companies are deploying autonomous robotaxis and even driverless semis with no specific federal regulations. And the nascent move from gasoline to electric vehicles presents safety problems of its own, especially with battery fires that can be difficult to extinguish.",
      "The department includes the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates automakers, including Elon Musk's Tesla. The department sets fuel economy standards for cars and trucks and regulates the airline industry through the Federal Aviation Administration, which is grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers to ensure the safe and orderly flow of air travel.",

      "Trump has criticized electric vehicles as expensive and unreliable and called President Joe Biden's policy to promote them \"lunacy. He also has said EV manufacturing will destroy auto industry jobs and has falsely claimed that battery-powered cars don't work in cold weather and are unable to travel long distances.",
      "Trump has softened his rhetoric about electric vehicles in recent months after Musk endorsed him and campaigned heavily for his election.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary, paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing from the cable news giant, his lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the Army veteran reached a confidential settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,\" said Parlatore, adding that the woman and her attorney \"knew that simply filing it would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth].\"",
      "Fox News Media said in a statement Monday it \"was not made aware of the incident or the settlement.\"",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Parlatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",
      "Trump has indicated that these revelations have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary. After reports surfaced of the sexual assault accusation, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.\"",
      "The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman, whose identity has been kept confidential, filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey confirmed the 2017 investigation into Hegseth and said in a statement that investigators found the woman had \"contusions\" on her right thigh. No charges were filed, Parlatore said.",
      "The Washington Post, which first reported the financial payment, obtained what it referred to as a memo that was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser alleging Hegseth raped a conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at the hotel bar. According to the Post, the memo states that the day after the incident, the accuser \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack.\"",
      "CBS News has not seen the memo and cannot verify its contents.",
      "Parlatore told CBS News that there is eyewitness testimony and video surveillance footage that allegedly shows the accuser was the \"aggressor\" in a consensual sexual encounter. \"[Hegseth] was intoxicated. She was sober. She was the one grabbing him by the arm and leading him out of the bar to take him upstairs,\" he said.",
      "When asked if CBS News could view the footage, Parlatore said, \"No.\" He also declined to share the names of any eyewitnesses.",
      "CNN reported that it spoke with the alleged victim last week, who \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth's name.\" CNN says she declined to be interviewed at the time and then stopped responding.",
      "Parlatore would not share the exact timing of the settlement payment to the woman. He said it occurred \"a couple years ago,\" emphasizing that it was \"well before Trump was even nominated [for the presidency], let alone had named Pete to this position.\"",
      "He also declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, only saying it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Two years after the alleged incident, Parlatore said that Hegseth was informed the woman was making what they called \"false claims\" against him and was threatening to sue him. Parlatore said that she had lost her job and claimed she needed money. In February of 2020, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter. She went \"quiet for a year\" before he learned she had found an attorney for her case.",
      "Trump's selection of Hegseth has been plagued with controversy. The announcement that the Fox News personality was his choice for secretary of Defense took many in Washington by surprise. \"Wow,\" responded Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski upon learning he had been picked to lead the Defense Department. \"I just said, wow,\" she repeated when asked for her thoughts.",
      "Even Hegseth's\u00a0tattoos have attracted scrutiny, specifically the \"Deux Vult\" tattoo on his inner bicep. The symbolism of that tattoo, which has been tied to extremist groups and the Christian Crusaders, alarmed a member of Hegseth's National Guard unit, who warned superiors that Hegseth was a potential \"insider threat\" before President Joe Biden's inauguration. He was removed from guarding the inauguration.",
      "After The Associated Press reported Hegseth had been flagged as a threat, Vice President-elect JD Vance defended him on social media, accusing the outlet of \"attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm.\"\u00a0Hegseth then shared Vance's tweet, commenting, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The news of Hegseth's financial settlement agreement with a confidentiality clause may ring familiar to Trump. The president-elect's own troubles related to a nondisclosure agreement with adult film star Stormy Daniels led to the New York trial in which he became a convicted felon, as well as the first former (and now future) president to be criminally prosecuted.",
      "Trump was found\u00a0guilty on 34 counts\u00a0of falsifying business records related to an alleged cover-up of the payment to Daniels.

    "title": "How RFK Jr. could impact vaccines as Trump's HHS secretary",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 13:54:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Kennedy insists he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but he has a long record of false and misleading statements\u200b about their safety and benefits. What could he do as Trump's HHS secretary?",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could wield significant authority to directly affect how and whether Americans get vaccines\u00a0nationwide, current and former federal health officials say, if he is confirmed next year to head the Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The position would grant Kennedy authority over efforts like the Vaccines for Children program, which is estimated to have saved 1.1 million lives by immunizing children against diseases like polio and measles that are now rare thanks to the shots.",
      "Many public health experts have decried the pick, saying Kennedy's past claims about vaccines are disqualifying.",
      "\"A serious candidate for this position would follow the decades of real-world evidence that shows that vaccines are safe and prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year,\" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Monday in a statement.",
      "Is RFK Jr. anti-vaccine?",
      "Kennedy has insisted he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and promised not to try to ban the shots under the Trump administration \u2014 but he has a long record of making misleading statements about vaccines and fanning doubts about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "He wrote a now-retracted article in 2005 falsely claiming autism was linked to a discontinued ingredient in vaccines, and continues to say he thinks vaccines are a cause of autism, which decades of scientific research has thoroughly discredited.",
      "On social media, Kennedy called COVID shots \"a crime against humanity\" and claimed children did not need COVID vaccines. (Research\u00a0estimates\u00a0that COVID vaccines prevented 3.2 million deaths in the U.S. through 2022.)",
      "The group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, has been denounced by experts for being among the most prolific spreaders of misinformation about vaccines.",
      "In recent months, Kennedy has\u00a0said his goal is to \"provide Americans with transparency and access to all the data so they can make informed choices.\" He also wants to clean house at federal health agencies, ousting \"corrupt\" officials he claims have clouded \"their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\"",
      "The head of the FDA's vaccines program says he hopes Kennedy will \"keep an open mind\" about what the science shows.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said earlier this month.",
      "CDC recommendations and covering costs",
      "One of the biggest roles that the CDC plays in vaccinations is in deciding which vaccines health insurers are required to cover. Nearly all plans are required by law to cover routine shots that are recommended by the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "Updating that \"schedule\" of routinely recommended vaccines is usually a monthslong process for the committee, which is made up of medical experts who work to publicly analyze and vote on the benefits and risks of different shots.",
      "Those meetings happen at least three times every year, as the committee debates newly approved vaccines, annual updates to routine shots like influenza or COVID-19 and reevaluating the data on older immunizations.",
      "\"They incorporate epidemiology. Which groups are most affected? Are there certain subgroups that it is most effective for? Are there some groups that may not benefit very much from a certain vaccine,\" said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations.",
      "Bridges, who now works as a consultant on adult vaccinations, praised the \"very public discussion and often very rigorous debate\" among the experts selected to serve on the committee.",
      "The CDC's career civil servants are traditionally able to offer input into which experts are chosen for the panel, and federal law says the committee's membership should be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view.\"",
      "But, it will be Kennedy's decision alone to decide who sits on the committee. Kennedy's pick to head the CDC would also have the authority to override the panel's votes, as was done in 2021 to roll out some COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations have a wide impact beyond insurance coverage, Bridges said, influencing how doctors and local health departments talk about and offer the shots.",
      "Kennedy and his pick to head the CDC could also affect the agency's wide-ranging immunization work in other ways.",
      "For example, the agency is responsible for the Vaccines for Children program that supplies shots to pediatricians nationwide to ensure no-cost access for uninsured children. It also routinely steps in to sort out any confusion among providers over vaccine recommendations.",
      "The CDC also runs the main national data sources tracking immunization rates, vaccine effectiveness for some common shots and ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety.",
      "\"It's really the integration of all of those things. There's a lot that goes into this \u2014 the policy, the monitoring, the coordination, the communication,\" Bridges said.",
      "FDA approvals and regulations",
      "Kennedy and whoever he picks to lead the FDA would also play a big role in both the approval of vaccines and in regulating them after they are on the market.",
      "Decisions on whether to approve or reject applications from vaccine makers are traditionally left up to career scientists working in the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That is mostly ensured only by norms, not law.",
      "\"It's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. And so, that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between the political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said Nov. 11, speaking at an event hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research.",
      "Califf said that \"99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products\" are made by civil servants with scientific expertise in the field. But the commissioner is sometimes forced to step in, like to resolve internal disagreements or appeals from outside the agency.",
      "Kennedy and his FDA commissioner could also influence vaccines in other ways, like through guidance the agency issues to manufacturers seeking approval.",
      "Policy changes recommended by the agency's staff can be stalled or rejected by political leaders. Major changes to FDA's rules are also funneled through the White House, which has the ability to block them.",
      "\"There's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it,\" Califf said.",
      "Communicating risks and benefits",
      "Beyond Kennedy's direct authority over vaccines, another major way he and his picks to head the CDC and FDA could influence public opinion is through how they approach talking to Americans about the risks and benefits of vaccines.",
      "The department funds a number of efforts to survey public confidence in vaccines and study ways to improve it. They also run a number of campaigns to promote recommended shots, like advertising about the annual COVID-19 and flu vaccines or helping health departments respond to backsliding immunization rates in schools.",
      "\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" said Bridges, citing a polio case that emerged in New York in 2022.",
      "Outbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.",
      "The return of polio prompted an investigation by health authorities and a renewed push for vaccinations, though officials acknowledged they struggled to \"meaningfully increase\" immunization coverage.",
      "\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold,\" said Bridges.",
      "Another way the communications role comes up is in navigating how to explain potential risks flagged by federal vaccine safety systems to doctors and the public.",
      "An example last year came after the FDA and CDC officials worked to craft a bulletin disclosing early concerns that COVID-19 shots might be increasing the risk of stroke for seniors, while also explaining why the preliminary \"safety signal\" did not warrant stopping use of the shots.",
      "Intense scrutiny of the issue by the U.S. and health authorities overseas eventually found \"no evidence of a safety concern,\" though health authorities continue to closely study the issue.",
      "The benefits of the vaccine continue to far outweigh this theoretical risk, the CDC's advisers concluded, especially among seniors who are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID.",
      "\"The current evidence does not support the existence of a safety issue. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data as they are available and update the public as needed,\" the FDA said.",

    "story": [
      "Steve Bannon, one of President-elect Donald Trump's loudest supporters, is scheduled for trial in February in a case in which Trump once pardoned him \u2014 but this time a White House pardon isn't on the table.",
      "A judge Tuesday set Feb. 25 as the start of Bannon's trial on charges related to alleged money laundering, conspiracy and a scheme to defraud. The case stems from Bannon's alleged role in an organization that raised millions on the promise \u2014 during Trump's first term in office \u2014 that they would privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Bannon and the now-defunct group, called We Build the Wall, are accused of pocketing donations. He has entered a not guilty plea in the case and called the charges \"nonsense,\" accusing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of pursuing allegations out of political animus.",
      "The judge also ruled prosecutors could show jurors evidence that some of the charity's funds were used to cover more than $600,000 in credit card debt owed by another not-for-profit run by Bannon.",
      "Trial in the case was originally scheduled for November 2023, but has been delayed repeatedly.",
      "Bannon was indicted on federal charges in a similar case in August 2020, but Trump pardoned him as one of his last acts before leaving office in 2021 after his defeat to President Biden.",
      "Presidents cannot issue pardons for state charges. As Trump enters the second month of his new presidency, his former senior counsel and White House chief strategist will be in court.",
      "Bannon completed a four-month federal prison sentence just three weeks ago. He was incarcerated for defying a subpoena from a congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Although Bannon already served that sentence, he could still be eligible for a pardon, which can help eliminate some consequences of conviction, according to Justice Department guidelines. Trump has promised while campaigning this year to pardon many of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, but has not said specifically if Bannon will be included in that group.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet and senior staff picks are facing an uncertain future as his selections received mixed reviews in recent days even from fellow Republicans \u2014 and a handful sent shockwaves through Washington.",
      "Trump's selection for attorney general in former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. And Trump's pick for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and former Fox News anchor, has also sparked concerns, especially as an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him has been made public. Additionally, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, doesn't have a background in intelligence and has drawn criticism for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut expressed astonishment about those questioning whether experience is necessary when asked about Gabbard, saying \"of course it's necessary.\"",
      "\"These people are manifestly unqualified, and you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run,\" Himes said.",
      "But Himes, the ranking Democrat on the the House Intelligence Committee, said that Gaetz's qualifications should also examined as well as the unreleased House Ethics Committee report.",
      "\"How is it that this is what we're focusing on?\" Himes said. \"Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.\"",
      "Gaetz' resignation from Congress after Trump's announcement came days ahead of a planned meeting and vote by the House Ethics Committee on whether to release a report on its investigation into Gaetz. Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that he would \"strongly request\" that committee withhold the potentially damaging report.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said Johnson makes \"an important point,\" warning that \"we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.\" But he stressed that the decision is the committee's alone, while noting that on Trump's selections, the Senate will exercise its advise and consent role through the confirmation process.",
      "\"President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government,\" Hill said.",
      "The Arkansas Republican outlined that when Trump came to office in 2017, there were members of his Cabinet who he had no personal relationship with or working background.",
      "\"He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration,\" Hill said.",
      "For his part, Himes offered some praise to some of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience.\"",
      "Still, he cautioned Republicans in the Senate as the confirmation process plays out, saying that he understands \"what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump,\" but \"history is a harsh judge.\"",
      "\"The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump,\" Himes said.",
      "Sue Gordon, who served as principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, stressed that vetting will be critical to the process moving forward, amid a New York Times\u00a0report\u00a0that Trump's team may bypass the typical FBI procedure and instead opt to use a private firm to vet his nominees who would be granted security clearances.",
      "\"It seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution,\" Gordon said, noting that a private firm won't have the same standards. \"I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that assists with presidential transitions, confirmed to CBS News that the Trump team hasn't signed paperwork that allows for security clearances and background checks, among other things, to occur. Gordon said she can't think of a \"good reason\" for the Trump team to forego the transition paperwork, saying that \"one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant.\"",
      "\"You're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base,\" Gordon said. \"To start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.\"",

    "summary": "Dr. Deborah Birx\u200b, former White House Coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday she is \"excited\" for the data on key health issues that will surface in Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Deborah Birx, former White House Coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday she is \"excited\" for the data on key health issues that will surface in Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data,\" Birx said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"What I know for sure is he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday in a social media post that he'll nominate Kennedy to oversee the Health and Human Services Department, which encompasses multiple agencies and has a $1 trillion budget. The position has to be approved by the Senate, which, come January, will be controlled by Republicans, which could make the nomination process easier but is not a guarantee.",
      "\"I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),\" Trump wrote in a social media post last week. He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "At an October rally, Trump\u00a0promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "Kennedy has criticized vaccines extensively in the past, including spreading misleading claims about their safety. He has also pledged to tackle an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy argues that a number of health issues in the U.S. have worsened, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity, which he blames on federal inaction.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under the Trump administration. Kennedy instead promises to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding. This data is expected to be addressed in upcoming confirmation hearings in Congress, a dialogue that Birx said she believes Americans will benefit from learning more about the differing perspectives on concerns surrounding vaccines.",
      "\"So until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about,\" Birx said on Sunday.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, said at an event hosted by the Milken Institute last week ahead of Trump's decision that he hopes to find common ground with Kennedy and that he is also open to a conversation based on data.",
      "\"What I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" Marks said.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy will be in charge of a giant portfolio, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Birx said on Sunday that Kennedy, who ran for president this year but has never held public office and is already\u00a0facing criticism for his qualifications, would benefit from having an experienced team around him that come from the medical industry.",
      "\"So really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because \u2026\u00a0 HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments,\" Birx said.",

There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",
      "But that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise-and-consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug-fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz.",
      "Also, the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women. Since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted, and it was done, do you think, if you were a Senate, you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America \u2013 law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Like I say, I don't \u2013 I don't have \u2013 I don't personally know any details about the Ethics investigation or the allegations because I haven't \u2013 don't serve on that committee.",
      "But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee ask to see that report? And that may well be a decision that they take. And the Ethics Committee has a decision that they have to make. And Mike Johnson's expressed his view on that as well.",
      "So, as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do advise and consent for all the nominations. And President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on Face the Nation about your work around Syria and Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited Northern Syrian, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017, the first lawmaker since John McCain to do so.",
      "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself. Then, publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times.",
      "These were high-confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I serve on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence.",
      "And I think, should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the president of the United States and to the two Intelligence Committees.",
      "So, again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make. But I remind you, Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington.",
      "And the Senate too has their important job. And we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it was John McCain who went in 2017. You went in 2023. I may have misspoken there on the year.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Right. Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 so you believe the U.S. intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And I have led the charge against the Assad regime.",
      "I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel, or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine. And you have been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support.",
      "There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine.",
      "The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I believe that will go through, in my judgment.",
      "But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States, and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now.",
      "One of the selections that the president-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on-the-job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process.",
      "He has a distinguished background in the military. And that counts for a lot. And I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process.",
      "But, once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017, had Cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with, he knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision-making in his administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women, and the Senate will have their advice-and-consent function well underway.",
      "And Majority-Leader-to-be John Thune has said, look, he will be effective\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: \u2026 he will be speedy, he will take it done \u2013 get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it, frankly, here.",
      "I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just \u2013 who we just discussed in the previous segment,. She was a Democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that, on a major news show, the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land?",
      "Of course it's necessary. It's a little bit like our obsession right now with the Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: How is it that this is what we're focusing on?",
      "Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the attorney general, and yet we're sort of focused on this cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.",
      "It sort of reminds me of Al Capone. In 1931, Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now, he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, well, what about this Ethics report?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, no, these people are manifestly unqualified, and they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they have been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that history is a harsh judge.",
      "And I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. Talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney or many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that.",
      "But history is a harsh \u2013 a hard judge. And a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual, the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, the speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning.",
      "On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I do, Margaret.",
      "And just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the attorney general and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA, and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser.",
      "I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those were good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy.",
      "So, look, some of these nominations, I think, are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last night, president-elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive U.S. government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China.",
      "He also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and they have held golf tournaments through the \u2013 one of their entities at Trump golf courses.",
      "Do you think that, in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? This is sort of not subject to debate.",
      "We saw Trump's first term and the fact that that group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And, look, all \u2013 I don't know Elon Musk, odd character. You sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt space launch, to disrupt the auto industry and whatnot, but early reviews are not good.",
      "I read his 12-point government waste manifesto, and he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's part of the wasteful spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Guess what? You have got to pay interest on the debt. And so I'm skeptical that he has any clue.",
      "Look, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that they're heart surgeons and capable of running the United States.",
      "I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal. But I'm going to reserve judgment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you, I'm sure.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping. And they met for a little less than two hours.",
      "The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government, and copy information related to law enforcement actions.",
      "Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another.",
      "But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that I promise you they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So, my hope is that the president made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable and that he backs that up and, quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right?",
      "We're pretty good at hacking networks too. And I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it, but we \u2013 but that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that, in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.",
      "There will be some selections, as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer Elon Musk yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEOs, Scott Bessent, a cryptocurrency skeptic who's being considered for that role.",
      "Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role, he is a cryptocurrency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury secretary.",
      "I would note that his first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, I certainly had disagree with \u2013 disagreements with him on any number of topics, including de-sanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So we will see what he does on Treasury.",
      "What I will say is that, look, crypto\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 it's a little bit like the Gaetz Ethics report.",
      "Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so I would just argue \u2013 and, by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. It's a technical issue I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in. And thank you for your time.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who joins us from Lexington.",
      "Good morning to you, Governor.",
      "You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united \u2013 as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky): I think there's absolute lessons that we can learn from Kentucky,a state where last year I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30.",
      "And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job and whether they make enough to support their family.",
      "It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: The goal here is to focus on all of those things where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning. They don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: So it's a \u2013 it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "We're going to take a break, come back, and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us.",
      "More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.",
      "Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy secretary if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling.",
      "Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of energy regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day. We just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1,600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on. But especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables.",
      "So, what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio.",
      "So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs. And we want to make sure that we never look down on, and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that that.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to undo the electric vehicle mandate, that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects.",
      "Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky, that voted for President-elect Trump by 30 points. And it's 10,000 EV-related jobs on the line. And those are only growing.",
      "Go up to Ohio and look at that - I think $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio, and what that would mean. Another state that voted for the president-elect.",
      "So, you look at all of these jobs, and jobs of the future, that have come to what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue.",
      "Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So, I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are.",
      "And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game-changing investments that have created a bright future here. And I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them. And not because I'm a Democrat -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them. And that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, $14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state.",
      "I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing because the vice president had 107 days, and she did her very best. And I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her.",
      "But what I know is going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: On their kids' education. Just - just those everyday worries. And with this administration at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: It's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that - that we are where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues or - so to speak.",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton said of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's speaking authentically and said Democrats should do more of it.",
      "Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that all candidates should stand up for their beliefs, and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year.",
      "But I did two things. Number one, I talked about my wife (ph). For me that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill.",
      "But the second thing is the voters in my state knew the very next day I was going to be working on jobs, I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We just cut the ribbon on. And we've created two pediatric autism centers in Appalachia so that people don't have to drive two hours. So, it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for - for your views.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But the other piece is about that focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Because, remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about jobs, we're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Governor, thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as president in the Oval Office. If this nominee-to-be, Tulsi Gabbard, becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the - I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird because it's always uncertain. And you are always making an assessment so that a decisionmaker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so, it's particular. And you - your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI is to go in there and to be his principal adviser on intelligence. You're the first in. You're the last out.",
      "You cannot afford to I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it. But Russia was, in fact, interfering, and he needed to hear that information.",
      "So, do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person if they believe they must be? They can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check -",
      "SUE GORDON: I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA. Then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidate. Then when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets, rather than go through that screening.",
      "What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It - you - you don't know why anyone should have to do it because you know who you are.",
      "But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institutions of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors.",
      "And -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's leverage on them?",
      "SUE GORDON: It is. I mean that's - I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests. And it just - and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that.",
      "So, a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, CBS has also learned that to date the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings so that someone's not walking in cold. They're briefed and up to speed. Along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS.",
      "Is there any good reason not to sign those papers? And what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I can't think of a - I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are maleficent. They need to be better. They need to be slimmer. They need to be more transparent, but they're not bums, so you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers.",
      "And especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So, I can't think of a reason why that's not signed. And to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She also has a history of statements of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of U.S. adversaries.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the U.S. intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when she comes out and says that she doubts it, she's skeptical, how's that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior adviser. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence-sharing agreements. So, our allies and partners, upon whom we rely that Syia assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was - sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you are talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes. Right. Right. Yes, I'm sorry.",
      "But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America. But they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests. And whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill informed with that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective. Can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way?",
      "So, I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tulsi Gabbard and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad any - good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that.",
      "There is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is, all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",

      "HHS has wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, overseas, Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group. What you have to really bring together - and frankly eliminate some of the duplications between these agencies to really become more cost effective. And so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff perhaps, that has really come out of industry, that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp - HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make.",
      "What's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food.",
      "Here's some of what he's said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: I'm just going to tell the cereal companies, take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately.",
      "Ten percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks, to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problems in our kids by giving them food that's poison. And I'm going to stop that.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can he actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think because of a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. You know, 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton, and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high.",
      "I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes based on household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America.",
      "And so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans, and we really start to tackle these issues one by one by one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up, and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady, to get any of that done. And it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans. And I think that's what people are calling for now.",
      "Europe did it years ago. And I think we are capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology. We can make food tasty without a lot of these additives because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So, we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains, we're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his - the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine - vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline of vaccination?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1,000 kids with autism, diagnosed autisms. Now it's three per 100. So, every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads. They want to know why. So, it's not good enough for us to just say, vaccines don't cause autism, it's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation with autism.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines. And there's no scientific basis for that conclusion, as I understand it.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data.",
      "What I know for sure is, he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So, until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now. But what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical.",
      "And I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what Covid vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my child vaccines do and don't. And they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child. Like H flu (ph) and pneumo vax (ph) to protect their child from getting very serious illness. And we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters so much on this.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why his past statements are being scrutinized.",
      "You worked on Aids for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and Aids, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book and said, \"Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using accepted scientific proof.\"",
      "Do you agree with that assertion on HIV and Aids?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and Aids progresses, HIV virus is the cause of Aids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Period.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: There's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to - it's asymptomatic for ten years. And we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us.",
      "But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: So, by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T- cells that we use today in cancer.",
      "So, a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas. And I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. If he's open to the data.",
      "Dr. Birx, thank you.",

      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",

      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",

      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",

    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO/newly-minted efficiency czar Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX plans to launch the world's most powerful rocket today on its sixth test flight \u2014 a ground-shaking sub-orbital launch of a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate critical upgrades.",
      "What time will the SpaceX Starship launch take place?",
      "Liftoff of the 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville is targeted for 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "As with the rocket's\u00a0fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight remained the same: to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster flies itself back to the launch pad where giant mechanical arms will pluck it out of mid air.",
      "Will Trump attend the SpaceX Starship launch?",
      "Trump is flying to south Texas to witness the Starship launch. He posted on X: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "Trump mentioned the new rocket in a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, urging Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "This time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines will be re-started in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also are testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its web page, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",

    "summary": "November's full moon, known as the Beaver Moon, is the last supermoon of 2024. Here's when it peaks and why it's called the Beaver Moon.",
    "story": [
      "When astronomy fans look to the sky this week, they'll get to see November's Beaver full moon, the last of 2024's four consecutive supermoons.",
      "The 2024 series of supermoons started in August with a rare supermoon blue moon. After this month's Beaver Moon, there won't be another supermoon until late next year.",
      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",
      "What makes supermoons special?",
      "A supermoon happens when the moon is simultaneously full and at the part of its orbit that's closest to Earth, according to NASA. The moon's distance from Earth varies between around 221,457 miles and 252,712 miles.",
      "During this month's supermoon, the moon will be about 224,385 miles from Earth.",
      "Supermoons appear larger than the average full moon. It's similar to the size difference between a quarter and a nickel, according to NASA. Supermoons are also about 16% brighter than an average moon.",
      "While all supermoons appear bigger and brighter than the average full moon, there is some variance. According to NASA, the November full moon will appear 6.2% bigger and 12.8% brighter than 2024's average full moon.",
      "When will the first supermoon of 2025 occur?",
      "Next year, expect three supermoons, starting in October, according to earthsky.org. There will be one on Oct. 7, 2025, followed by Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. Then the following new year will start with a supermoon on Jan. 3, 2026.",

      "\"This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please.\"",
      "Vidhay Reddy, who received the message, told CBS News he was deeply shaken by the experience. \"This seemed very direct. So it definitely scared me, for more than a day, I would say.\"",
      "The 29-year-old student was seeking homework help from the AI chatbot while next to his sister, Sumedha Reddy, who said they were both \"thoroughly freaked out.\"",
      "\"I wanted to throw all of my devices out the window. I hadn't felt panic like that in a long time to be honest,\" she said.",
      "\"Something slipped through the cracks. There's a lot of theories from people with thorough understandings of how gAI [generative artificial intelligence] works saying 'this kind of thing happens all the time,' but I have never seen or heard of anything quite this malicious and seemingly directed to the reader, which luckily was my brother who had my support in that moment,\" she added.",
      "Her brother believes tech companies need to be held accountable for such incidents. \"I think there's the question of liability of harm. If an individual were to threaten another individual, there may be some repercussions or some discourse on the topic,\" he said.",
      "Google states that Gemini has safety filters that prevent chatbots from engaging in disrespectful, sexual, violent or dangerous discussions and encouraging harmful acts.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Google said: \"Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\"",
      "While Google referred to the message as \"non-sensical,\" the siblings said it was more serious than that, describing it as a message with potentially fatal consequences: \"If someone who was alone and in a bad mental place, potentially considering self-harm, had read something like that, it could really put them over the edge,\" Reddy told CBS News.",
      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries. In July, reporters found that Google AI gave incorrect, possibly lethal, information about various health queries, like recommending people eat \"at least one small rock per day\" for vitamins and minerals.",
      "Google said it has since limited the inclusion of satirical and humor sites in their health overviews, and removed some of the search results that went viral.",
      "However, Gemini is not the only chatbot known to have returned concerning outputs. The mother of a 14-year-old Florida teen, who died by suicide in February, filed a lawsuit against another AI company, Character.AI, as well as Google, claiming the chatbot encouraged her son to take his life.",
      "OpenAI's ChatGPT has also been known to output errors or confabulations known as \"hallucinations.\" Experts have highlighted the potential harms of errors in AI systems, from spreading misinformation and propaganda to rewriting history.",

    "story": [
      "The Guardian will no longer post its content under its official account on X, the British newspaper announced on Wednesday.",
      "The Guardian stated the move had been under consideration for a while, \"given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism.\" The media outlet added that the U.S. presidential election campaign underscored its view that the social media platform is \"toxic\" and that its owner, Elon Musk, used it to shape political discourse.",
      "The London-based paper's announcement comes as President-elect Donald Trump named Musk as co-head of what he called his \"Department of Government Efficiency.\" Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX, was heavily involved in Trump's campaign.",
      "X had been Twitter before its board agreed to be acquired by Musk in 2022 in a deal that valued the platform at $44 billion.",

    "summary": "Amazon rolls out a new shopping service, dubbed Amazon Haul, that sells items for $20 or less.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon on Wednesday debuted a new online shopping service called Amazon Haul that experts said could help the e-commerce giant compete with Chinese retailers Temu and Shein.",
      "Amazon Haul \u2014 whose name is a play on social media \"hauls,\" where people show off their purchases \u2014 focuses on selling items for $20 or less, or what Amazon calls \"crazy low prices.\" In a blog post, Amazon said the new service is available in its shopping app and mobile website.",
      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",
      "How much do Amazon Haul items cost?",
      "Amazon said everything on Amazon Haul costs less than $20, but most products are priced at $10 and less.",
      "Items available on Amazon Haul on Wednesday included a three-pack of fuzzy socks for $4.99 and a quilted tote bag for $7.99. The merchandise ranged from clothing to household items such as silicone baking mats and throw pillows.",
      "The company offers discounts on larger orders, such as 5% off orders above $50 and 10% off orders of $75 or more.",
      "What is the delivery time for Amazon Haul items?",
      "Longer than regular Amazon items, with the company noting that the goods are typically delivered within one to two weeks.",
      "What do the experts say?",
      "Amazon Haul could help the retailer appeal to younger shoppers, noted GlobalData's Saunders. But it also raises the risk that the low-cost shopping site could cannibalize sales from Amazon's main site, he added.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump will be on hand with Elon Musk for the sixth test flight of SpaceX's huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket today.",
    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO/newly-minted efficiency czar Elon Musk\u00a0looking on, SpaceX plans to launch the world's most powerful rocket today on its sixth test flight \u2014 a ground-shaking sub-orbital launch of a gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship to evaluate critical upgrades.",
      "What time will the SpaceX Starship launch take place?",
      "Liftoff of the 30-foot-wide, 397-foot-tall rocket from Musk's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test facility on the Gulf Coast near Brownsville is targeted for 5 p.m. EST, the opening of a 30-minute launch window.",
      "As with the rocket's\u00a0fifth test flight last month, the primary goals of Tuesday's flight remained the same: to boost the Starship out of the lower atmosphere on a sub-orbital flight to re-entry over the Indian Ocean while the Super Heavy booster flies itself back to the launch pad where giant mechanical arms will pluck it out of mid air.",
      "Will Trump attend the SpaceX Starship launch?",
      "Trump is flying to south Texas to witness the Starship launch. He posted on X: \"I'm heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground. Good luck to @ElonMusk and the Great Patriots involved in this incredible project!\"",
      "Trump mentioned the new rocket in a Sept. 21 campaign speech in Wilmington, North Carolina, urging Musk to \"get those rocket ships going because we want to reach Mars before the end of my term. We want to do it.\"",
      "What's different about launch 6 than the previous 5 launches?",
      "This time around, one of the Starship's methane-burning Raptor engines will be re-started in space to demonstrate the propulsion system's ability to perform critical maneuvers and future de-orbit burns.",
      "Engineers also are testing \"a suite of heatshield experiments and maneuvering changes for ship reentry and descent over the Indian Ocean,\" SpaceX said on its web page, along with software and booster hardware upgrades intended to add additional propulsion system redundancy and increase the rocket's structural strength.",
      "The October test flight was the first featuring a successful launch pad \"catch\" and the first with a Starship that reached the Indian Ocean essentially intact.",
      "For Tuesday's flight, launch was moved to the late afternoon in Texas to ensure a daylight splashdown for video documentation.",
      "Plans for the Super Heavy-Starship",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the centerpiece of Musk's drive to develop a fully reusable heavy-lift rocket, which he says is the key to making humanity \"multi-planetary.\" And now, with Trump's support, he may be able to kick start that effort.",
      "Shortly after winning the presidential election, Trump announced that Musk and one-time presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy would lead a new agency known as the Department of Government Efficiency. The goal, Trump said in a statement, is to \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulation, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk said in the same statement: \"This will send shockwaves through the system, and anyone involved in government waste, which is a lot of people.\"",
      "SpaceX already holds billions in government contracts and is building a variant of the Starship to serve as the initial lunar lander in NASA's Artemis moon program. It remains to be seen how Musk's role in the new administration might advance SpaceX's plans or how questions about conflicts of interest might be resolved.",
      "Politics aside, \"we are looking at a serious effort to return to the moon, and maybe a serious effort ... to send, if not humans to Mars in the next four years, a lot of stuff and a lot of infrastructure that will enable humans to get to Mars,\" said Casey Drier, director of space policy for the Planetary Society.",
      "\"Maybe not in four years, but maybe in the next 10.\"",
      "The key to those plans is the Super Heavy-Starship.",
      "How does the Super Heavy-Starship work?",
      "The Super Heavy booster is powered by 33 Raptor engines burning liquid methane and oxygen to generate more than 16 million pounds of thrust at full throttle, more than twice the liftoff power of NASA's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. The Starship is powered by six Raptors and will be capable of carrying astronauts, satellites and science probes.",
      "Like the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the 230-foot-tall first stage is designed to be fully reusable, flying itself back to the launch pad where giant \"chopsticks\" mounted on the pad gantry can catch the booster as it descends, enabling rapid servicing, re-fueling and launch.",
      "Unlike the Falcon 9, which uses a throw-away second stage, the 160-foot-tall Starship also is reusable, capable of safely returning to Earth after launching satellites or carrying astronauts to the moon and eventually, Musk says, to Mars.",
      "SpaceX already ferries astronauts and cosmonauts to and from the International Space Station using Falcon 9s carrying the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft and is building a variant of the Starship for NASA to carry astronauts back to the moon's surface in the 2026-27 timeframe.",
      "The company also launches commercial and military satellites, is building a powerful space tug for NASA to help drive the International Space Station safely out of orbit when the program is retired in 2030 and is launching thousands of its own Starlink satellites to provide global access to the internet.",
      "\"SpaceX functionally has the monopoly on access to space,\" said Drier. \"Pretty much any asset that you want to launch into space, whether you're the U.S. government or commercial provider, a satellite company, even the European Space Agency, they are all using SpaceX rockets.\"",

We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.\"",
      "\"Every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness,\" she wrote on social media.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's six-year New York criminal odyssey\u00a0might need to continue for at least another four, prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in a letter to Justice Juan Merchan that Trump should not be sentenced for his crimes until after he completes his second term in office. That would be the year 2029, more than a decade after the investigation into Trump's coverup of a \"hush money\" payment began.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" the filing said.",
      "Merchan had been slated to rule on Nov. 12 on whether presidential immunity should have prevented jurors from seeing certain evidence at Trump's trial this spring, but he postponed his decision. Merchan said he wanted to hear from prosecutors about how to proceed with the case, which entered uncharted terrain when Trump was reelected president.",
      "Prosecutors said in their filings that they intend to oppose any effort by Trump to dismiss his case outright. Trump's lawyers said in a previous letter that they would do so, claiming his election meant the case might cause \"unconstitutional impediments to President Trump's ability to govern.\"",
      "Prosecutors said in the short term, they are also unopposed to delaying Trump's sentencing, currently on the schedule for Nov. 26, while his attorneys awaiting and responding to his motion to dismiss.",
      "Trump is the first person in American history to win the presidency after being convicted of crimes. He was also the first former president to face trial for crimes.",
      "Trump promised minutes after a unanimous jury found him guilty of felonies in May to fight his conviction. Weeks later, the Supreme Court ruled former presidents are immune from prosecution for official acts and that evidence related to Trump's work as president could not be used at trial.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued the Supreme Court's ruling meant the conviction should be set aside, and his sentencing canceled. They said jurors heard testimony from former White House staff that should have been out of bounds during the trial. The legal team was led by Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who Trump has said he will appoint next year to senior posts in the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "Bragg's office has argued that the material protested by Trump's team was \"a sliver of the mountains\" of evidence the jury considered \u2013 so small it shouldn't mean tossing aside the jury's decision.",
      "The jury found that Trump committed 34 felonies, largely by authorizing a plan to conceal reimbursements to Michael Cohen, his former attorney and fixer. Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels, days before the 2016 presidential election, in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump. The payment has often been referred to as a \"hush money\" payment.",
      "Trump insists he is not guilty of falsifying business records \u2014 the charge he was convicted on \u2014 and has vehemently denied Daniels' story.",
      "The Manhattan District Attorney's Office, then led by Cyrus Vance Jr., began investigating the \"hush money\" deal in 2018. It soon widened into an expansive probe into Trump's finances. Trump assailed the investigation during his first presidency, fighting a subpoena to the Supreme Court, which in a landmark 2020 decision allowed the office to get Trump's tax returns.",
      "When Bragg took office in 2022, he pared down the investigation, refocusing it on the \"hush money\" deal. A grand jury indicted Trump on March 31, 2023 and his trial began in April of this year.",
      "The seven-week trial ended with his conviction. The jury deliberated for less than two days.",
      "After hearing guilty 34 times, Trump turned around, clasped his son Eric's hand for a moment, and walked out of the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors were still packing their briefcases as Trump's voice could be heard from just beyond the doors.",

Prosecutors said Ibarra killed Riley after a struggle, and data from Riley's smartwatch shows her heart stopped beating at 9:28 a.m.",
      "After Riley failed to answer the phone, her mother, Allyson Phillips, texted her several times, casually at first but then with increasing concern, according to data pulled from Riley's phone.",
      "At 9:37 a.m., her mother texted, \"Call me when you can.\" Phillips called twice, and when her calls went unanswered, she texted her daughter at 9:58 a.m., \"You're making me nervous not answering while you're out running. Are you OK?\" Phillips texted again at 11:47 a.m., writing, \"Please call me. I'm worried sick about you.\" She and other family members continued to call Riley.",
      "Phillips cried in court as the text messages were read aloud by Georgia police Sgt. Sophie Raboud, who examined data from Riley's phone, CBS News producer Jarred Eggleston reported. Raboud also testified about video from surveillance cameras near the wooded trail, and Phillips and some other family members and friends cried as video played showing Riley running on the trail the morning of her death.",
      "Ibarra, 26, is charged with murder and other crimes in Riley's death in February, and his trial began Friday. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "He waived his right to a jury trial, meaning the case will be decided alone by Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard. The case could go to the judge by the end of Tuesday.",
      "The killing added fuel to the national debate over immigration when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. Riley, 22, was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles\u00a0east of Atlanta.",
      "Surveillance video also showed a man who prosecutors say is Ibarra walking around an apartment complex where a female graduate student said someone tried to get into her apartment and peered in the window early the day Riley was killed. The man is seen going up to the door of that apartment six times over a period of roughly an hour, twice opening the outer screen door, Raboud testified.",
      "Georgia Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Lucas Breyer testified about reviewing the body camera video from the officer who found Riley's body in the woods. He testified that her clothes were \"heavily manipulated,\" describing the waistband of her running tights as having been pulled down some and her jacket, shirt and sports bra having been pulled way up.",
      "CBS News' Eggleston reported that some of the crime scene testimony was so gruesome that members of Riley's family left the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutor Sheila Ross said during her opening statement that Ibarra had gone out \"hunting for females\" that morning in February and that he killed Riley after a struggle when she \"refused to be his rape victim.\" Law enforcement officers have testified there was no evidence that Riley was sexually assaulted.",
      "Defense attorney Dustin Kirby said in his opening that Riley's death was a tragedy and called the evidence in the case graphic and disturbing. But he said there is not sufficient evidence to prove that his client killed Riley.",
      "Ross told the judge Monday that she expected to finish calling witnesses Tuesday, and defense attorneys said their witnesses should take half a day at most. Prosecutors had already called nearly two dozen witnesses over the first two days of testimony, Friday and Monday. That included law enforcement officers, Riley's roommates and a woman who lived in the same apartment as Ibarra.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors played a recording of a jail phone call from May between Ibarra and his wife, Layling Franco. FBI specialist Abeisis Ramirez, who translated the call from Spanish, testified that Ibarra told Franco that he had been at the University of Georgia looking for work, and that his wife repeatedly said she was fed up and that she wanted him to tell the truth.",
      "Franco \"continues to ask, 'What happened with the girl?'\" and said Ibarra \"must know something,\" Ramirez said. He responds: \"Layling, enough.\" Ramirez said Franco told Ibarra that it's crazy that police only found his DNA.",
      "Riley's parents, roommates and other friends and family packed the courtroom Friday and again Monday and Tuesday.",
      "Republicans, including President-elect Donald Trump, blamed Democratic\u00a0President Joe Biden's border policies\u00a0for her death. As he spoke about border security during his State of the Union address weeks after the killing, Biden mentioned Riley by name.",
      "In March, FBI Director Christopher Wray offered\u00a0unusually expansive comments\u00a0on Riley's murder.",
      "\"I want to tell you how heartbroken I am \u2014 not just for the family, friends, classmates, and staff who are grieving Laken's loss,\" Wray told a group gathered at the University of Georgia. \"I'm saddened to see that sense of peace shattered by Laken's murder and the subsequent arrest of a Venezuelan national who'd illegally entered the country in 2022.\"",
      "He said the FBI was doing \"everything [it] can to help achieve justice for Laken.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 12:45:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The police department has spent $22.6 million in overtime this year for officers working special events \u2014 only about $2 million of which has been reimbursed to the city.",
    "story": [
      "CITY HALL \u2014 The city spent $22.6 million on police overtime for special events this year but has only been reimbursed $2 million, leaving taxpayers to cover the remaining costs.",
      "City law requires special event producers to pay for police services beyond 12 shifts. However, an investigation by Block Club Chicago and CBS Chicago revealed through records requests that the city has not been retroactively charging for those costs.",
      "Chicago hosts hundreds of street festivals each year, with approximately 1,300 events held between 2021 and 2023. During that period, nearly 2,800 Chicago police officers logged a combined total of 27,000 overtime hours to patrol these events, according to a CBS News Data Team analysis of police overtime records and special event permits.",
      "At a Chicago Police budget hearing on Friday, officials confirmed that a significant portion of the overtime associated with special events has gone unreimbursed, attributing the issue to a \"decentralized system.\"",
      "In 2024, the police department spent $22.6 million on special event overtime across various music, street, and neighborhood festivals. About $7.2 million of that is attributed to ticketed events like Lollapalooza, the Chicago Marathon, and NASCAR. However, the city has only been reimbursed for Lollapalooza and the Chase Corporate Challenge, totaling just under $2 million, police officials disclosed on Friday.",
      "The 2024 figures are an increase from 2023, which saw $19.2 million spent in police overtime across all special events, police officials said. It's currently unknown how much of that was reimbursed to the department. Special events include large ticketed festivals, street festivals, athletic events and bar crawls. Chicago hosted 677 special events in 2023, according to records obtained by CBS Chicago.",
      "The revelation aligns with months of unanswered public records requests directed at the Department of Finance, which has been unable to produce invoices for police overtime at street festivals.",
      "While the department did provide invoice data for traffic control aides at events like Riot Fest, Lollapalooza, and several 5Ks, it referred CBS News to the city's Public Safety Administration for police overtime. However, the Public Safety Administration has not responded to records requests for police overtime details and did not return requests for comment.",
      "\"What may make more sense is we can provide all of our historical data about what our costs are, and we can provide that to DCASE, we can provide that to the Department of Finance. We can give a unified city service quote at the front end,\" said Ryan Fitzsimons, Deputy Director at the Chicago Police Department.",
      "During a budget hearing for the Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events last week, officials revealed that their department is not involved in the invoicing process for reimbursing police overtime, raising concerns among aldermen that permits are being issued to event producers with outstanding balances.",
      "On Friday, police officials said that despite the lack of reimbursement, they do not have the authority to block special event permits unless there are safety concerns. This lack of enforcement power leads to ongoing accountability issues with invoicing, they noted.",
      "\"We conduct numerous after-action meetings with OEMC and other city agencies. The problem is that, while we identify these reimbursement issues during those meetings, they are not addressed in subsequent permits issued the following year,\" said Chief Duane DeVries, head of the Bureau of Counterterrorism with the Chicago Police Department.",
      "After each permitted special event, the Chicago Police Department generates an \"event evaluation form\" that tracks the number of incidents and officers assigned to the event.",
      "On Friday several aldermen requested event evaluation forms for various Chicago's special events.",
      "In July, the CBS News Data Team and Block Club Chicago requested event evaluation data for various events from 2019 to 2024, including PrideFest, Market Days, Wicker Park Fest, and Lollapalooza. The department said the evaluations were kept on paper. A request for those documents was made in August. As of last week, the department is still working on that request.",
      "All special event producers are required to present security plans to Chicago Police for feedback before the city's events department issues a permit. The amount of private security is determined by various factors, including the event's history, location, current events and crime trends. Event organizers suggest a security plan and the police department approves, denies and makes suggestions.",
      "Because of this, some special event producers have argued that they should not be required to pay for police overtime.",
      "\"It's like someone coming and painting your house and then saying, 'I want you to pay for it.' \u2026 Well, I didn't want you to paint my house,\" Hank Zemola, CEO of Special Events Management, previously said. \"I ordered all this (security) so we wouldn't have to do that.\"",
      "Special Events Management puts on numerous special events including street races and neighborhood street festivals. The company organizes some of the city's most popular street festivals like Pridefest, Ribfest and others.",
      "By city law, street festivals cannot charge an entry fee but can propose suggested donations for entry. With suggested donations in decline, inflation making festivals more expensive to produce and consumers spending less, Zemola estimates that at least 50% of the company's events this year lost money.",
      "Still, with the City Council looking for cost-saving measures aldermen are eager to close the loophole that is hemorrhaging money from this city.",
      "\"I hope that with the information ... your department provides us, we can, from the council side, work on maybe a better process that gives you guys ... a seat at the table ... so that we can better manage and join our resources,\" said Ald. Maria Hadden (49th).",

The film, \"Bread &\u00a0Roses,\" is directed by Afghan filmmaker Sahra Mani, produced by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence\u00a0and executive produced by Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai.",
      "Mani details the grim reality faced by millions of women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule, which drew the attention of Lawrence in 2021.",
      "\"My first reaction when watching that was to do what the Taliban did not want us to do, which was give access and facilities to the people on the ground to capture what was happening on the ground in real-time,\" she said. \"Because obviously the Taliban flourishes in secrecy.\"",
      "Some of the strict limitations imposed on women in Afghanistan under Taliban rule include prohibiting women from working, pursuing education, or even leaving their homes without a male escort. They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me. How can you stop a girl from her school? They come up with these excuses that it's culture, it's religion. There is no culture, excuse. The true representatives of that culture are the Afghan women and girls that we've seen in the documentary.\"",
      "The documentary follows three Afghan women who secretly filmed their protests. Mani said she wanted to capture the intimate moment of their life and give people an opportunity to see what life is like for Afghan woman under a Taliban dictatorship. But she also wanted to encourage by highlighting their strength.",
      "It's a reality that Lawrence said would be difficult to experience.",

      "\"There's 20 million women whose lives are in danger,\" she said.",
      "Yousafzai, who survived a Taliban attack in 2012, reflected on the ongoing fight for women's rights.",
      "\"What really shook me was the fact that people stand with you once you have survived, but we don't look at people who are still under a big threat,\" she said. \"Let's share our solidarity with them.\"",

And the president-elect made it something of a litmus test for Senate leadership as Republicans won majority control in the November elections.",
      "What is a recess appointment?",
      "Though the Senate is tasked with an advice and consent role in the confirmation process, the Constitution's Recess Appointment Clause affords the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, and appointees may stay in the role until the end of the following session.",
      "The recess appointments power \"was built for a time when the Senate was not meeting year round,\" says Casey Burgat, the director of the Legislative Affairs Program at George Washington University's Graduate School of Political Management.",
      "\"You were coming from all states, travel was a problem, and horses and carriages, and they would be out of session more often than they were in session,\" Burgat says. \" And so to ensure that the government can continue its work, they gave the president appointment power to name, within recess, someone to take the place.\"",
      "More recently, recess appointments have been used by presidents including President George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 Bush and Clinton made over 100 recess appointments \u2014 although they were generally used to fill positions below the Cabinet level. In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on a challenge to a handful of Obama appointments, giving the Senate more authority to prevent the maneuver and determining that the chamber must be away for 10 days for recess appointments to occur.",
      "In recent years, the Senate has used pro-forma sessions to gavel in even when the chamber is on recess in part to avoid recess appointments. And paired with the elimination of a 60-vote threshold for nominees in 2013 \u2014 making it easier for the majority to make confirmations \u2014 recess appointments haven't been made in about a decade.",
      "But that could change in Trump's second term. Under the Constitution, both chambers have to agree to adjourn for three days or more. And at Trump's urging, House and Senate Republicans, who are set to narrowly control both chambers in the new Congress, may agree to do so.",
      "Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who last week was elected to serve as Senate majority leader in the new Congress, said \"all options are on the table\" to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office, including recess appointments. He's suggested that while the typical confirmation process is preferred, if Senate Democrats obstruct the confirmation proceedings, Republicans may have to resort to other options.",
      "Still, pushback from just a handful of Republicans who oppose the recess appointment effort \u2014\u00a0 which would undermine their ability to study nominees, request documents and have a hearing \u2014 could block the move to put the chamber in recess. But experts say Trump could move to adjourn Congress anyway.",
      "Could Trump adjourn Congress to make recess appointments?",
      "The Constitution outlines that a president may adjourn the House and Senate in the case of \"Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.\" So if one chamber approves a resolution to adjourn and the other votes it down, Trump could theoretically weigh in and declare Congress in recess.",
      "But some experts say that what constitutes a disagreement between the chambers could be interpreted differently, due to the unprecedented nature of the approach, questioning whether a simple lack of action from one chamber after the other approves a resolution to adjourn may be viewed as disagreement.",
      "\"It's not clear at all how this would work,\" says Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, noting that the issue is something that almost certainly would result in litigation.",
      "Glassman said in a scenario where the House tries to force the Senate out of session to make recess appointments, \"it's not clear to me the court is going to like the idea of the president and the House conspiring to end run the Senate on nominations.\"",
      "Trump is \"threatening to turn the Constitution's appointment process for Cabinet officers on its head\" with the recess appointments strategy, Edward Whelan, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, warned in an op-ed in the Washington Post. He urged that House Speaker Mike Johnson, who would be a key player in Trump's ability to unilaterally adjourn Congress, \"can and should immediately put an end to this scheme.\"",
      "But Johnson on Sunday left the door open to the strategy, saying on Fox News when asked whether he would take steps to put Congress in recess that a president should be able to \"choose his team,\" and \"if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country.\" But he acknowledged that he's \"very hopeful\" the Senate will do its job and move the nominees along.",
      "The move by the president to adjourn Congress to make recess appointments would create a new precedent, experts say, affecting the way presidents see presidential power going forward.",
      "\"When they may see a power deferred to them, they're very reluctant to give it back going forward,\" Burgat says. \"The minute you cross the red line, all of a sudden, that red line looks like it didn't matter at all in the first place.\"",

      "A so-called \"doomsday fish\" has washed up on a Southern California beach \u2014 typically an extremely rare occurrence, but this is the second time this year it has happened. The rare oarfish found on Grandview Beach in Encinitas measured roughly 9 to 10 feet and was spotted by a doctoral candidate at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, the school wrote on social media.",
      "The doomsday fish got its name because it looks like a mythical sea creature, with a long, ribbon-shaped body that can grow up to 30 feet, according to Ocean Conservancy.",
      "After doctoral candidate Alison Laferriere found the odd-looking fish \u2014 which resembles a larger-than-normal eel with a monstrous face \u2014 Ben Frable, manager of the Scripps Oceanography Marine Vertebrate Collection, contacted the\u00a0NOAA Fisheries Service\u00a0team to bring the animal to its Southwest Fisheries Science Center.",
      "\ud83d\udc1f Just when you thought the oarfish hype had died down \u2026 Look what decided to make another appearance!\n\n\ud83c\udf0a Last week,...",
      "This oarfish is smaller than the one found in La Jolla in August 2024. Researchers are not yet sure why the rare fish has washed up on California beaches recently, and there have been few studies on the species.",
      "Only 20 oarfish have\u00a0washed up in California\u00a0since 1901, according to the Scripps Institute. And these deep-sea dwellers usually only come ashore when they are sick, dying or disoriented, Ocean Conservatory says.",
      "\"It may have to do with changes in ocean conditions and increased numbers of oarfish off our coast,\" Frable said, according to the institute's social media post. \"Many researchers have suggested this as to why deep-water fish strand on beaches. Sometimes it may be linked to broader shifts such as the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycle but this is not always the case. There was a weak El Ni\u00f1o earlier this year. This wash-up coincided with the recent red tide and Santa Ana winds last week but many variables could lead to these strandings.\"",
      "The researchers at Scripps took samples and froze the specimen to further study the oarfish and its biology, anatomy, geonomics and history, according to Frable.",
      "In a comment on the post, the institute cleared up a myth surrounding doomsday fish. \"There have been many questions and comments about the connection between oarfish and earthquakes,\" the comment states. \"While oarfish have a mythical reputation as predictors of natural disasters and earthquakes, experts have debunked this as folklore. A 2019 study found no correlation between oarfish or ribbonfish strandings and earthquakes in Japan.\"",
      "The aforementioned study, published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, looked at reports of oarfish and slender ribbonfish in Japanese newspapers. Japanese folklore says the appearance of these fish means an earthquake is coming, but the researchers found there was hardly a relationship between these fish and the occurrence of earthquakes and that newspapers likely reported the fish sightings \"because rare appearances might attract readers,\" according to the study.",
      "Oarfish typically live in the mesopelagic zone \u2014 the area of the ocean\u00a0least explored\u00a0by scientists. They float vertically through waters 3,280 feet deep, where there is little light. Their silvery, reflective bodies help them blend in if they do hit patches of light, according to the conservatory.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 22:40:32 -0500",
    "summary": "A judge has struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy.",
    "story": [
      "A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming's overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy in line with voters in yet more states voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled consistently three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.",
      "The decision marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures in support of access.",
      "One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women's rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect a pregnant woman's life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.",
      "The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened as the state's first full-service abortion clinic in years in April 2023 following an arson attack in 2022.",
      "\"This is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming \u2014 and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,\" Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.",
      "The recent elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment in support of abortion rights, but they'll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \"pregnancy outcomes\" prevailed in New York.",
      "The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they're pregnant.",
      "Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September 2024. Georgia's Supreme Court ruled the next month that the ban there can be enforced while it considers the case.",
      "In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.",
      "As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans \"will undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,\" Owens ruled.",
      "The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people \u2014 those who are pregnant \u2014 in violation of the constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.",
      "Wyoming voters approved the amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.",
      "Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn't include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, whose administration has defended the laws passed in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email message Monday seeking comment.",
      "Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set, but won't be necessary with this ruling.",

      "Chad Wyen is the superintendent at Mad River, and the only armed member of the staff whose identity is public. His firearm is in a locked cabinet that's unlocked by a code. It was Wyen's idea to have guns near teachers in a safe, rather than on them \u2014 a strategy to prevent unauthorized access.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 13:22:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Canada legalized medically assisted dying in 2016. It was set to expand to patients suffering solely from mental illness last year, but it hasn't \u2014 yet.",
    "story": [
      "When Savannah Meadows had lunch last October with her mother, Sharon Turcott, Meadows was \"all smiles,\" the mother told CBS News.",
      "\"Maybe she's turned a corner,\" Turcott recalled thinking about her daughter, who had been struggling with serious mental illness.",
      "The next morning, she received a scheduled email: \"Mom, if you're reading this, I'm probably on my way to heaven,\" it said. Her daughter had taken her own life at the age of 44.",
      "\"She did not want to die by suicide. She did not want to die alone,\" Turcott said.",
      "Instead, Meadows had been seeking a medically assisted death \u2014 something Canada legalized in 2016. It had been set to expand last year to patients who were suffering solely from mental illness, but that expansion was delayed, and Meadows ultimately died by suicide.",
      "The delay has been welcomed by some, but condemned by others.",
      "The history of Canada's, still evolving MAID law",
      "In 2016, Canada enacted a law allowing medical assistance in dying, known as MAID, for people whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable. Under the law, following a process establishing that all eligibility criteria have been met, a physician or nurse either directly administers a substance that induces death or prescribes a drug that the person takes themselves.",
      "Five years later, the law was expanded, no longer requiring a person's death to be reasonably foreseeable as an eligibility criterion for adults with a grievous and irremediable medical condition. Under the changes, individuals suffering solely from mental illness were temporarily excluded for eligibility until March 2023.",
      "Meadows, described by her mother as a proud trans woman, had picked a date and began preparations for the end of her life.",
      "\"It gave me time to accept the fact that my daughter was going to die,\" Turcott said.",
      "A few days before Meadows would potentially have been eligible to seek a medically assisted death, however, the government announced a yearlong delay for the consideration of cases of mental illness. Seven months later, Meadows died by suicide.",
      "The delayed inclusion of patients seeking MAID on the basis of mental illness has been met with apprehension from the start.",
      "Canada's Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness, established to assist in developing the government's approach to the expansion of the law, outlined concerns in a 2022 report, including the daunting task for clinicians asked to make predictions about individual patients and establish incurability and irreversibility despite the difficulties of predicting the evolution of mental disorders.",
      "Another factor was what the report referred to as structural vulnerability, or the risk of factors such as unstable housing or lack of employment opportunities resulting in individuals viewing death as an only option.",
      "The panel offered a number of recommendations in its report for establishing an expanded MAID regime.",
      "The future of the MAID law's expansion, however, is also dependent to some degree on domestic politics, which appear set to shift. Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party is up by a significant margin in polls ahead of national elections set to take place within a year, has vowed to \"revoke entirely\" the expansion of the law to include solely mental health cases, arguing that it blurred a line \"between suicide prevention and suicide  assistance.\"",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to.\"",
      "Since her daughter's death, meanwhile, Turcott has become an advocate for MAID access for those whose sole underlying condition is mental illness.",
      "\"She would have died the way she wanted to, and because that's what she wanted, that would have been fine with me,\" Turcott said. \"Suicide was not fine with me.\"",
      "In February, the government further postponed MAID eligibility for patients whose sole condition is mental illness until March 2027 \u2014 four years after it was initially slated to go into effect.",
      "Mark Holland, Canada's Minister of Health, said that while \"significant progress has been made in supporting practitioners in assessing MAID eligibility in complex cases,\" the country's health system was \"not yet ready for MAID where the sole underlying condition is mental illness.\"",
      "The delay has been condemned by some MAID advocates. Dying With Dignity Canada, an organization that advocates for end-of-life rights, filed a lawsuit in August alleging discriminatory exclusion in the law against people with mental illness.",
      "An ongoing debate over access to MAID",
      "Others, however, view the delay as a step to ensure necessary safeguards are in place and health care providers are prepared to handle relevant cases. The Canada Mental Health Association said in a January statement that it supported the postponement, citing what it called insufficient time and resources allocated to ensure that people with mental illnesses can access the necessary care.",
      "Some groups oppose the law's expansion outright. In September, Inclusion Canada, a nonprofit group that advocates for Canadians with intellectual disabilities, filed a lawsuit challenging MAID for people with a disability who are not dying or whose death is not \"reasonably foreseeable.\"",
      "The lawsuit argues that MAID Track 2, the 2021 expansion of the law to include patients whose deaths are not reasonably foreseeable, had already resulted in premature deaths.",
      "\"People are dying. We are witnessing an alarming trend where people with disabilities are seeking assisted suicide due to social deprivation, poverty and lack of essential supports,\" Krista Carr, executive vice-president of Inclusion Canada, said in September.",
      "Compounding CMHA and Inclusion Canada's concerns, an expert committee of professionals from disciplines including ethics, social work and medicine that reviewed MAID deaths in Ontario identified cases in which it said isolation and unmet social needs, such as housing, had fueled several euthanasia recipient's requests.",
      "The committee also found that patients seeking eligibility under the expanded Track 2 criteria were about 8% more likely to reside in areas of the province with high levels of social marginalization than MAID Track 1 recipients.",
      "The committee's report acknowledged that while the deaths discussed were not necessarily representative of frequent reasons for accessing MAID Track 2, or even the majority of MAID Track 2 deaths, the themes identified were \"not uncommon within the MAID review process.\"",
      "Out of 4,644 medically assisted deaths carried out during 2023 under Canada's MAID law, only 116 deaths were Track 2 patients, according to the committee.",
      "But the report's findings don't resonate with everyone, and opposition to the law's proposed inclusion of patients who suffer from only mental illness has been deeply frustrating for some people seeking MAID.",
      "Jason, a Toronto resident who didn't want to be fully identified over concerns that his future MAID review process could be affected, is one of those people.",
      "\"When I first heard that it was delayed, my world came crashing down,\" he said.",
      "Jason told CBS News that he's struggled with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for decades, and has attempted suicide twice. He said he's tried inpatient programs, medication, electroconvulsive therapy and ketamine treatment, among other remedies, to little avail.",
      "\"I would not be alive today if there wasn't the possibility of MAID going through in 2027,\" he said, saying the chance of MAID's expansion was the only reason he hadn't attempted suicide a third time.",
      "The current safeguards for those seeking MAID whose death is not reasonably foreseeable include two independent practitioners \u2014 one of whom must have expertise in the condition affecting the patient \u2014 confirming that all eligibility criteria are met, a minimum period of 90 days for eligibility assessments to be made, and the opportunity for the patient to withdraw consent at any point up until the procedure is carried out.",
      "The patient must also be informed of counseling and palliative care options, support for disabilities and mental health, and be offered consultation with relevant professionals in addition to having discussed with their practitioner \"reasonable and available means to relieve the person's suffering, and agree [with the practitioner] that the person has seriously considered these means.\"",
      "In a poll conducted in 2023 by Dying with Dignity Canada, 78% of respondents said they supported the removal of the \"reasonably foreseeable\" natural death requirement from the MAID law, indicating strong support for the Track 2 expansion. But a 2017 survey gauging the attitudes of Canadian psychiatrists toward medical assistance in death found only a minority of 29.4% supported MAID on the basis of mental illness alone, compared to 71.8% who said other factors should also be present to determine eligibility.",
      "Jason said he understood some doctors' opposition to MAID for mental illness.",
      "\"Doctors are there to make you better,\" he said. But he added that as mental illness isn't something that \"shows up on a screen,\" it can be difficult for people without direct experience to understand the extent of someone else's pain.",
      "\"I don't have the physical pain that someone else has, but the psychological pain is just as bad,\" he said.",
      "In 2022, MAID deaths accounted for 4.1% of overall deaths in Canada, with the average age of MAID patients being 77, according to Canada's fourth and most recent annual report on Medical Assistance in Dying. Since the law was introduced in 2016 there have been a total of 44,958 medically assisted deaths in the country.",
      "Jason said he didn't want to put his family through the trauma of another suicide attempt, and that his brother and mother were helping him explore options abroad. Those options, especially for people suffering mental illness, are limited, and often complicated by varying domestic laws around the world.",
      "Jason said that, like Turcott, his own mother is supportive of his choice to seek MAID.",
      "\"As much as she doesn't want me to do this again, she would rather I die properly with the assistance of a doctor than have it done by suicide,\" he said.",
      "Turcott said she was concerned that the postponement of MAID on the basis of mental health would result in more suicides, leaving families to mourn unexpectedly.",
      "\"I don't want anybody to experience the loss of their child through suicide, and their child being so desperate that they saw no other choice but to take their life,\" she said.",

They are also barred from singing, playing music, making films, and, more recently, dining at restaurants or purchasing food in public.",
      "Lawrence and her producing partner, Justine Ciarrocchi, set out to reveal these realities in Afghanistan through the eyes of Afghan women. They enlisted Mani to direct the documentary and Yousafzai joined the project as an executive producer to help amplify its message.",
      "When asked why the Taliban opposes women's education, Yousafzai said, \"We have been trying to figure out an answer to that for the past 30 years\u2026I cannot find any explanation that justifies it to me.

If confirmed, it could be the first time Ukrainian troops had taken advantage of President Biden easing restrictions over the weekend on Ukraine's use of the U.S.-made missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russian territory.",

    "title": "Will Israel annex the occupied West Bank after Trump takes office?",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 07:44:09 -0500",
    "summary": "A senior Israeli official has said openly that the West Bank should become part of Israel, not a future Palestine. Could it happen under Trump?",
    "story": [
      "In the wake of former President Donald Trump's re-election, Israel's far-right minister of finance suggested the country would look to annex the occupied West Bank in 2025. Here's what you need to know:",
      "What is the West Bank?",
      "The West Bank is an area of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, which is part of the former British-mandated territory of Palestine. It is surrounded by Israel on three sides \u2014 the north, west, and south \u2014 and it borders the country of Jordan on its east, across the river.",
      "After the departure of British forces in 1948 when the modern state of Israel was created, Arab forces entered and retained the West Bank, and the city of Jerusalem was divided into two sectors: the Israeli west and the Jordanian east.",
      "During the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel occupied the West Bank and established a military administration there. Israel claimed East Jerusalem as part of its own territory, but fighting between the Israelis and the region's Palestinian inhabitants \u2014 who live with significant restrictions on their movement and other aspects of life under the decades-long occupation \u2014 has continued.",
      "Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, decisively won a 2006 West Bank parliamentary election over the Western-backed Fatah faction, led by Mahmoud Abbas, which had been administering the Palestinian Authority. The Hamas victory brought sanctions and boycotts by the U.S., the EU and Israel of the new, Hamas-led joint Palestinian leadership.",
      "In 2007, Abbas dissolved the Hamas-led administration in the West Bank and created an emergency cabinet that favored Fatah. The power struggle between the two Palestinian factions led to a split between the West Bank and Gaza, with Western powers supporting the Fatah-administered West Bank diplomatically and economically, while blockading the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.",
      "How could U.S. policy change during the second Trump administration?",
      "The longstanding position of the United States has been support for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, meaning the creation of an independent state of Palestine alongside the independent state of Israel. Most iterations of this policy envision a future Palestinian state made up of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as Gaza.",
      "Trump's previous administration bucked tradition, but did not flat-out reject a two-state solution. Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and offered a plan that would have cemented Israeli control over the entire city. It also would have protected Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, while moving toward Palestinian self-rule.",
      "President-elect Trump's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas governor and Baptist preacher Mike Huckabee, has never supported a two-state solution.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press when he was running to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2015, Huckabee said that, if elected, his administration would formally recognize the West Bank as part of Israel.",
      "\"I feel that we have a responsibility to respect that this is land that has historically belonged to the Jews,\" Huckabee told the AP.",
      "In a podcast interview earlier this year, Huckabee said that there \"isn't such a thing\" as Palestinians, describing himself as an \"unapologetic, unreformed Zionist.\" He voiced similar views during his campaign in 2008.",
      "Israel \"is an extraordinary oasis in a land of totalitarianism surrounded by tyranny,\" he said on the podcast earlier this year.",
      "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for Secretary of State, has repeatedly voiced support for the Israeli government's response to Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "\"Although the Biden-Harris Administration has publicly backed Israel's right to defend itself, it has also undercut Israel's maneuverability, leading to a schizophrenic policy towards the region,\" Rubio said in a letter to current Secretary of State Antony Blinken in August.",
      "Voicing his objection to U.S. sanctions against individuals alleged to be supporting \"extremist settler violence\" against Palestinians in the West Bank, Rubio wrote that, \"Israel has consistently sought peace with the Palestinians. It is unfortunate that the Palestinians, whether it be the Palestinian Authority or FTOs such as Hamas, have rejected such overtures. Israelis rightfully living in their historic homeland are not the impediment to peace; the Palestinians are.\"",
      "Israel's far-right government says it's preparing for annexation of the West Bank",
      "Some of those who do not support the creation of an independent Palestinian state do support Israel's annexation of the West Bank, including members of the current far-right Israeli government led by Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu's Likud party is currently part of a coalition, formed to keep Netanyahu in power, with radical right-wing nationalist parties such as the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "Netanyahu, who has spoken out against the creation of a Palestinian state, committed to pursuing the annexation of the West Bank in Likud's coalition agreement with the Religious Zionist Party.",
      "\"The people of Israel have a natural right to the Land of Israel,\" the agreement says. \"In light of the belief in the aforementioned right, the Prime Minister will lead the formulation and promotion of a policy within the framework of which sovereignty will be applied in the West Bank, while choosing the timing and considering all national and international interests of the state of Israel.\"",
      "Bezalel Smotrich, the Israeli finance minister who's a member of the Religious Zionist Party, said he believed Israel could work with the incoming Trump administration to promote annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I am convinced that we will be able to work closely together with President-elect Trump and all members of the incoming administration, to promote the common values and interests of the two countries, to strengthen the strength and security of the State of Israel, to expand the circle of peace and stability in the Middle East out of strength and faith and on the basis of recognition in the unquestionable historical belonging of the whole Land of Israel to the people of Israel,\" Smotrich said on social media.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts in the West Bank are illegal under international law. They're also seen as a barrier to a potential two-state solution, because the more Israeli Jews live in the occupied territory, the less likely it seems that Israel would ever abandon control of the land for it to become part of a Palestinian state.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey carried out in the summer found Israelis divided on the potential security risks and benefits of continued settlement expansion, with 40% of respondents saying they help make Israel more secure and 35% saying they hurt security. The survey found 21% of Israelis didn't believe settlement expansion would have any significant impact on security.",
      "Some Israeli activists believe their government is taking advantage of the country's collective grief after the Oct. 7 attack to push an agenda in the West Bank that doesn't have broad public backing.",
      "\"In Israel, there's very little public criticism or any sort of public debate on what is going on in the West Bank,\" Sarit Michaeli, international advocacy lead for the Jerusalem-based rights group B'Tselem, told CBS News of the situation post-Oct. 7 attack. \"Israelis are furious. They're angry. They're hurt. They're traumatized, and this collective trauma has been exploited by our government to push forward policies that most Israelis don't necessarily agree with in the West Bank.\"",
      "In June, the Israeli body that governs the West Bank transferred many powers over the territory from Israeli military officials to civil ones, who work under Smotrich.",
      "Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, the monitoring group Peace Now says it has documented at least 43 new illegal outposts in the West Bank, mostly on farmland. Dozens of new roads have been paved to facilitate the establishment of these outposts, the group said.",
      "What would it mean if Israel does annex the West Bank?",
      "In 2020, Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) analyzed what Israeli annexation of the West Bank could actually entail. They looked at three possible scenarios, with Israel either taking full security and administrative control of a portion of the Palestinian territory, or just preventing future evacuation of existing Israeli settlements.",
      "In all three of the scenarios examined, Israeli sovereignty would not necessarily be applied in full to Palestinians in the area. If it were to be, Palestinians would live under the jurisdiction of the State of Israel and, under Israeli law, would be entitled to request citizenship.",
      "The INSS said annexing West Bank territory would make it harder for future Israeli governments to give up that land as part of any deal to create a Palestinian state.",
      "\"In actuality, annexation means tying the hands of future Israeli governments that would be willing to transfer territories for a political settlement,\" the INSS report said.",
      "One senior Palestinian politician in Gaza recently told CBS News that regardless of what changes Israel ushers in under the new leadership in Washington, it would not end the Palestinian people's decades-long fight for a state of their own.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" Mustafa Barghouti, a doctor in Gaza and the leader of the Palestinian National Initiative party, told CBS News. The Palestinian National Initiative party champions a unified democratic government for both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that,\" Barghouti said.",

      "Parts of the Great Barrer Reef have suffered the highest coral mortality on record, Australian research showed Tuesday, with scientists fearing the rest of it has suffered a similar fate.",
      "The Australian Institute of Marine Science said surveys of 12 reefs found up to 72 percent coral mortality, thanks to a summer of mass bleaching, two cyclones, and flooding.",
      "In one northern section of the reef, about a third of hard coral had died, the \"largest annual decline\" in 39 years of government monitoring, the agency said.",
      "Often dubbed the world's largest living structure, the Great Barrier Reef is a 1,400-mile expanse of tropical corals that house a stunning array of biodiversity.",
      "But repeated mass bleaching events have threatened to rob the tourist drawcard of its wonder, turning banks of once-vibrant corals into a sickly shade of white.",
      "Bleaching occurs when water temperatures rise and the coral expels microscopic algae, known as zooxanthellae, to survive.",
      "If high temperatures persist, the coral can eventually turn white and die.",
      "This year had already been confirmed as the fifth mass bleaching on the reef in the past eight years.",
      "But this latest survey also found a rapid-growing type of coral -- known as acropora -- had suffered the highest rate of death.",
      "This coral is quick to grow, but one of the first to bleach.",
      "Lead researcher Mike Emslie told public broadcaster ABC the past summer was \"one of the most severe events\" across the Great Barrier Reef, with heat stress levels surpassing previous events.",
      "\"These are serious impacts. These are serious losses,\" he said.",
      "World Wildlife Fund-Australia's head of oceans, Richard Leck, said the initial surveys confirmed his \"worst fears.\"",
      "\"The Great Barrier Reef can bounce back but there are limits to its resilience,\" he said. \"It can't get repeatedly hammered like this. We are fast approaching a tipping point.\"",
      "Leck added the area surveyed was \"relatively small\" and feared that when the full report was released next year \"similar levels of mortality\" would be observed.",
      "He said the findings reinforced Australia's need to commit to stronger emission reduction targets of at least 90 percent below 2005 levels by 2035 and move away from fossil fuels.",

      "Students were arriving for classes around 8 a.m. at Yong'an Elementary School in the city of Changde when a small white SUV drove into a crowd of children and adults, according to state media.

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 04:21:05 -0500",
    "summary": "A Russian lawmaker calls President Biden's decision to let Ukraine fire U.S. missiles deep into Russia a \"very big step toward the beginning\" of a third world war.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to fire U.S.-made and supplied missiles deeper into Russia \u2014 a major policy shift announced over the weekend after months of intense lobbying by Kyiv \u2014 has drawn a furious response from Moscow. While there was no immediate reaction directly from the man who launched the nearly three-year war on his neighboring nation, lawmakers aligned with President Vladimir Putin in Russia said Monday that the move was unacceptable and warned it could lead to a third world war.",
      "Mr. Biden authorized Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to use American-made missiles with a range of about 190 miles, known as ATACMS, to strike deeper inside Russian territory than the Ukrainians have to date.",
      "So far, Ukraine's attacks beyond the immediate border region inside Russia have been limited to non-U.S. \u2014 and much less potent\u2014\u00a0 weapons such as explosive drones. ATACMS are far more destructive and harder to shoot down as they head for their programmed targets.",
      "Zelenskyy's government had been pushing Washington for permission to use the missiles for long-range attacks for some time but the Biden administration had been reluctant given concerns about potentially escalating the war.",
      "Over the weekend, however, the calculus apparently changed. The decision came almost 1,000 days into the full-scale war in Ukraine, and with Mr. Biden about two months away from handing over the White House keys to President-elect\u00a0Trump, who's seen as far less supportive of Ukraine's ambitions of hanging onto all of its Russian-occupied territory.",
      "It also came as Russia hit Ukraine with a devastating missile attack, highlighting Ukraine's desperate desire for the ability to target Russian weapons systems deeper inside the country before they're launched, which Zelenskyy has stressed for more than a year.",
      "Many of the Russian rockets launched Sunday targeted energy infrastructure but a ballistic missile carrying cluster munitions also struck a residential part of the northern city of Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and leaving more than 80 others wounded. Fresh strikes hit apartment buildings in the southern city of Odesa on Monday, killing at least eight people including a child, regional authorities said.",
      "Residents in Sumy were targeted as they slept, and Ukrainian officials called the Sunday missile and drone salvo one of the largest Russian attacks since the start of the war.",
      "With the change in policy from the outgoing administration in Washington, Ukrainian forces will be able to retaliate harder, reaching further into Russia than ever before. Ukrainian forces have launched drone attacks into Russian territory, including targeting Moscow, for months, but with limited effect.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the change in U.S. policy, saying \"strikes are not made with words\u2026 The missiles will speak for themselves.\"",
      "But Ukraine's war-time leader also appeared to acknowledge the change in tack in Washington that Trump's second swearing-in will bring, with a far greater emphasis expected on striking a negotiated truce than on defending Ukraine's sovereign territory from unilateral annexation by Russia.",
      "\"It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House. This is their approach, their promise to their citizens,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet, adding that Ukraine \"must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means.\"",
      "In Moscow, meanwhile, senior lawmaker Leonid Slutsky slammed Mr. Biden, accusing him of deciding \"to end his presidential term and go down in history as 'Bloody Joe'.\"",
      "Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov, meanwhile, told Russia's state-run Tass news agency that Biden's decision represented \"a very big step toward the beginning of the third world war.\"",
      "The official newspaper of the Russian state, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, warned \"the madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain.\"",
      "Putin had personally warned against the eventuality previously, issuing a warning in September that U.S. permission for Ukraine to fire American-supplied long-range missiles at his country, \"would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries, are parties to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "But Putin himself has dramatically raised the stakes in the war since then, by overseeing the deployment of at least 11,000 North Korean troops to fight alongside Russian forces. According to U.S. and South Korean officials, they've joined the battle in Russia's western Kursk region, a significant portion of which Ukrainian troops occupied earlier this year in a surprise offensive.",
      "According to John Sullivan, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia under both Trump and Mr. Biden, it may have been that move by Putin \u2014 \"really solidifying this as a global conflict with troops from North Korea fighting in Europe\" \u2014 that proved to be \"the last straw\" for the current U.S. president.",
      "\"It's been one escalation after another by Putin and, in my opinion, it was about time that the United States gave the Ukrainians the ability to defend themselves more completely,\" Sullivan said Monday on CBS Mornings.",
      "The parameters of the permission granted to Ukraine for the use of the ATACMS haven't been confirmed, but according to reports, they include \u2014 and may be limited to \u2014 Ukraine using the missiles to attack Russian defensive positions in Kursk.",
      "James Nixey, who heads the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think tank, said in an analysis Monday that the change in policy from Washington was \"not a game changer,\" especially if it included a limitation on where Ukraine can use the ATACMS.",
      "\"The relaxation of range limits for Ukraine's usage of US ATACMS follows the overall pattern of America's approach to this war: to make sure Ukraine cannot inflict significant damage on Russia\u2026 but to allow small increases in hardware provision and their usage over extended periods of time,\" he said. \"If it is true that the authorization for usage extends only to the Kursk region (and is therefore primarily directed at North Korean troops); then, again, this fits the pattern, and means the overall effects on the war will be negligible.\"",

    "story": [
      "Police in Russia are investigating after renowned Russian ballet dancer Vladimir Shklyarov reportedly fell to his death over the weekend. He was 39.",
      "Shklyarov was a star dancer at the Mariinsky, the historic opera and ballet venue in Russia's imperial capital of Saint Petersburg. His funeral will be held on Thursday, the Mariinsky Theatre announced.",
      "Citing theater representatives, Russian media reported that he fell from a fifth-floor balcony on Saturday after taking painkillers ahead of back surgery that had been scheduled for Monday.",
      "\"His loss is deeply felt by the entire Mariinsky family and the wider ballet world,\" the theater said Monday in a statement, without commenting on the circumstances of Shklyarov's death.",
      "Shklyarov had been a principal dancer with the theater since 2011, \"captivating audiences with his expressive artistry and technical brilliance,\" it said.",
      "He was married to fellow company dancer Maria Shklyarov, with whom he had two children, CBS News' partner network BBC News\u00a0reported.",
      "A memorial service will be held Thursday at the theater, followed by a church service and burial in central Saint Petersburg.",
      "Russian investigators have launched a probe into Shklyarov's death, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency, which said authorities' preliminary assessment was that it was likely to have been an accident.",
      "Shklyarov won several prestigious awards for his performances in classic ballets including The Nutcracker, Romeo and Juliet, Sleeping Beauty and Manon, and had regularly toured internationally.",
      "Shortly after Russia launched its full-scale military offensive on Ukraine, Shklyarov criticized Russia for ordering troops into the neighboring nation in a social media post that was later deleted.",
      "Unlike other some performers, such as Olga Smirnova, a prima ballerina at Moscow's famed Bolshoi who left the country in protest, Shklyarov stayed in Russia and continued performing with the Mariinsky under its pro-Kremlin leadership.",
      "Shklyarov had performed at prestigious venues around the world, including the Royal Opera House in London and Metropolitan Opera in New York, according to the BBC. In 2014 and 2015, he was a featured guest artist at the American Ballet Theatre in New York, the BBC said.",
      "\"We mourn the tragic loss of Vladimir Shklyarov, an extraordinary artist whose grace and passion inspired audiences worldwide,\" the American\u00a0company wrote on Instagram Sunday. \"Your light will continue to shine through the beauty you brought to this world.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 10:56:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The sister of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, an American activist killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says her idealistic vision of the U.S. has been shattered.",
    "story": [
      "More than two months after American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, allegedly by a member of Israel's security forces, her family tells CBS News their faith in the United States has been shattered due to the lack of any independent criminal investigation.",
      "Eygi's husband Hamid Ali said he was appalled by the reaction of the Biden administration.",
      "\"I would hope that the U.S. government is able to implement its own law in this case and withhold, at the very least, funding from its own taxpayers that went to this unit or this soldier that killed one of its own citizens,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Neither the Biden administration nor any U.S. law enforcement agency has announced an investigation into Eygi's killing. The State Department told CBS News it continues pushing to see the results of a \"full, transparent\" Israeli probe.",
      "Eygi's sister, \u00d6zden Bennett, said the Biden administration's response had made the grieving process \"even more heartbreaking and painful.\"",
      "\"No family should have to experience this,\" she told CBS News, with tears in her eyes.",
      "Bennett said that growing up in the U.S., she had developed an idealistic vision of the country and its values but her sister's death \"shattered\" those ideas.",
      "\"It feels like they don't care about all U.S. citizens the same way,\" she said. \"The U.S. government, or the Biden administration particularly, not opening an investigation makes us question why it is not being equally treated.\"",
      "Witnesses, her family, and the group Eygi had joined at a protest have said the U.S.-Turkish dual national was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper as she stood under a tree in the West Bank city of Nablus.",
      "She was shot not long after joining a protest organized by the International Solidarity Movement, at which the Israel Defense Forces said some demonstrators had thrown projectiles at troops. Witnesses said she was shot after the protest, and away from where it had taken place.",
      "The IDF said an initial inquiry found it was \"highly likely that she was hit indirectly and unintentionally\" by a member of the Israeli security forces. The IDF told CBS News on Thursday that it was unable to provide any further detail on its ongoing investigation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News last week that the U.S. has continued to press Israel for \"a full, transparent, and rapid investigation.\"",
      "\"We are eager to see the findings as soon as possible, including any appropriate accountability measures that will be taken,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Asked whether the U.S. government intended to launch its own criminal investigation into Eygi's killing, the White House referred CBS News back to President Biden's statement from September, in which he said Israel had \"acknowledged its responsibility for Aysenur's death,\" and that the U.S. had \"full access to Israel's preliminary investigation, and expects continued access as the investigation continues, so that we can have confidence in the result.\"",
      "But Eygi's father, Mehmet Suat Eygi, said it seemed to have become the norm for the U.S. government to downplay the killing of Americans by Israeli forces. He said his daughter's death reminded him of the deaths of other U.S. nationals in the Palestinian territories, particularly Rachel Corrie and Shireen Abu Akleh.",
      "\"It's beyond disappointment,\" the bereaved father told CBS News. \"The reaction of the U.S. government only asserts that Israel could kill anyone and there would be no consequences.\"",
      "He emigrated to the Seattle area in 1999, when his daughter was 10 months old, and was naturalized in 2005. Aysenur Eygi grew up in the Pacific Northwest and graduated from the University of Washington in the spring of 2024. She had planned to start a PhD program after taking a gap year off.",
      "\"The safety of American citizens should not be tied to their ideological support to Israel,\" Eygi's father told CBS News.",
      "Samah Park Imtiaz was a close friend of Eygi. Sobbing quietly, she recalled to CBS News their last phone call, when Eygi told her how much she missed her cat.",
      "\"I am still in a dream state when I think about what happened,\" Imtiaz said. \"[Biden] said whoever hurt Americans would face consequences. We are Americans and we deserve answers.\"",
      "In September, 103 members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter to Mr. Biden urging the administration to launch an independent investigation into Eygi's killing.",
      "\"To walk away without asking further questions gives Israeli forces unacceptable license to act with impunity,\" the lawmakers said.",
      "Brad Parker, a member of the legal team supporting Eygi's family, called the Biden administration's response thus far \"underwhelming,\" and said it was \"concerning\" that there had not been a \"strong sign to pursue justice for Aysenur.\"",
      "\"I think it's the policy at this point, which can be characterized as providing impunity to Israeli forces, even in the killing of American citizens,\" he told CBS News. \"The focus has been on having the Israeli military adjust [its] rules of engagement, rather than justice and accountability for specific killings of American citizens.\"",
      "Eygi's husband, Ali, said Israel's close alliance with the U.S. should not make it immune to consequences.",
      "\"Israel has a history of not being forthcoming with any kind of investigation and, when they are, it is largely inadequate what they come up with,\" he said.",
      "His sister-in-law said the Biden administration had yet to address the family's pain, \"aside from condolences.\"",
      "\"If the U.S. government does not respond to cases like hers, which historically they have not, Israel has the green light to continue acting with impunity and killing other citizens,\" Bennett asserted.",

    "summary": "Gazans say they'd welcome Trump making good on his vow to end the war, but not \"at the expense of the Palestinian people.\"",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 After more than a year of bombing and homelessness, Gazans are looking to a new administration in Washington for help. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory has raised hopes and fears among the five million residents of the Palestinian territories \u2014 the war-torn Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Gaza resident Rakan Abdul Ahman told CBS News he wants the new U.S. president to make Israel end the war.",
      "\"We've witnessed enough killing of women and children,\" he said. \"I'm looking for Trump to end the suffering in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In the eyes of Ahmed Harb, a Gazan journalist, the incoming Trump administration faces a real test. In his victory speech, Trump said he'd end wars. Harb hopes that means the one in Gaza.",
      "\"I hope he was telling the truth,\" he told CBS News, adding: \"But he shouldn't stop the war at the expense of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "That is the big worry for Palestinian politicians, too, including Mustafa Barghouti. Still a practicing physician, he leads the Palestinian National Initiative, a party that champions democratic government for all Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "The question, Barghouti said, is \"how you stop the war? Do you stop it by annexing occupied territories? By ethnically cleansing Palestinians? Or do you stop the war by forcing Israel to end its illegal policy of settling Israelis on our land?\"",
      "Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group's massacre of some 1,200 people on Oct. 7, 2023, has diverted international attention away from growing violence in the West Bank by Israeli settlers determined to encroach on what has been Palestinian land.",
      "In 2023, there were a record number of so-called outposts \u2014 makeshift Jewish encampments set up by settlers in what has been Palestinian land. They can be as simple as a couple of shipping containers that function as a de-facto Jewish real estate claim. The settler groups then lobby Israel's courts and government to retroactively make the outposts official Jewish settlements.",
      "Right-wingers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet support Jewish expansion, including the outposts, in the West Bank. They openly advocate driving the Palestinians out, and annexing the whole area for Israel. Not only would that be illegal under international law, Barghouti warns that it would also lead to even more conflict.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" he said. \"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that.\"",
      "Palestinians everywhere are watching Trump's choosing of pro-Israeli officials for key positions with dismay, especially Mike Huckabee, the president-elect's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.",
      "Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is on the record as saying, \"there's really no such thing as a Palestinian.\"",
      "\"When you hear a person like Huckabee saying there is no occupation, and there are no settlements, they are just Israeli communities\u2026. he might as well say there is no international law,\" said Barghouti.",
      "During Trump's first term, he opposed the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, in 2020, proposed what he called \"the deal of the century\" \u2014 a template for a long-sought Palestinian state.",
      "Under his proposal, the new state would have been a scattering of isolated Palestinian lands, each surrounded by Israel. The plan was rejected by both the Palestinians and by Jewish settlers and, since then, both sides have dug in.",
      "Even if the new Trump administration revives some version of its proposal for a Palestinian state, it will face Palestinians and their Arab allies whose resolve has only been hardened by a devastating year of war in Gaza that has killed almost 44,000 people.",
      "On the Israeli side, hardliners in Netanyahu's government oppose any form of Palestinian sovereignty. Netanyahu himself has flatly rejected the prospect repeatedly.",
      "Barghouti, however, sounded ready for the fight.",
      "\"I'm sure it will be a rough year for everybody,\" he told CBS News. \"But whatever happens, we, the Palestinian people, will never give up our right to struggle for our freedom.\"",

    "summary": "Bernadett \"Betty\" Szabo, 19, was stabbed multiple times just months after giving birth to a baby boy.",
    "story": [
      "By a canal in Amsterdam's red-light district, one of the \"window women\" is actually a hologram which Dutch police hope will help solve the gruesome murder of a sex worker in 2009.",
      "Peering through a frame out onto passers-by, a human-sized likeness of Bernadett \"Betty\" Szabo -- in skimpy shorts and a leopard-print bra, a dragon tattoo covering much of her torso -- taps the pane and fogs the glass with her breath.",
      "The word \"HELP\" appears, chillingly, on the screen.",
      "\"Fifteen years ago, Betty was killed in a horrible way and the investigation was never closed,\" Amsterdam police spokesman Olav Brink told AFP.",
      "Aged only 19, Hungarian-born Betty was stabbed multiple times in her brothel room in the centuries-old red-light district, known as De Wallen, just months after giving birth to a baby boy.",
      "Despite a large-scale police probe, the case went cold.",
      "During a review, however, police found \"promising clues\" and decided to reopen the investigation, Brink said.",
      "They hope the likeness of Betty, created with 3D visualization technology, will jolt the memories of people who may have information about her murder.",
      "\"Betty was murdered in one of the busiest areas in Amsterdam, maybe even in the Netherlands. It is really almost impossible that there are no people who saw or heard something unusual at the time,\" cold case team member Anne Dreijer-Heemskerk said in a statement. \"We hope witnesses who may have been afraid before or kept silent for other reasons now have the courage to come forward.\"",
      "Waiting for the \"golden tip\"",
      "\"There are still people who know what has happened to Betty,\" said Brink, hoping that 15 years on, \"people feel freer to share information with the police.\"",
      "The initiative also aims to raise awareness about the violence faced by sex workers.",
      "Around 78 percent of prostitutes in the Netherlands have faced sexual violence and 60 percent report being physically attacked, according to a 2018 report by Dutch charities and sex worker rights groups.",
      "Concerns about violence also rose during the Covid-19 pandemic, when loss of income forced some prostitutes to continue working illegally and reduced their ability to report crimes to the police.",
      "In the week since the hologram and accompanying information about Betty went on display, the police have seen \"that a lot of people are talking about it.\"",
      "\"We find it quite special that Betty can bring attention to her case this way,\" said Brink.",
      "In the streets of De Wallen, lined with women watching from red-lit window booths, groups of locals and visitors pause and strike up conversations about the unusual display, entitled \"Who was Betty?\"",
      "Theo, 80, who lives outside Amsterdam, said he read about the project in the papers and \"came especially to see it\" when he was in the city.",
      "Soyoon Jun, 34, lives near the red-light district, \"so it was more shocking for me that there were neighbors who are going through this type of horrendous event.\"",
      "For Jun, who works at a Christian charity, the hologram made the murder \"real.\"",
      "\"It wasn't just information that was given out,\" Jun explained. \"People could feel the helplessness that Betty would have felt.\"",
      "The police have already \"received several tips because of the campaign,\" Brink confirmed to AFP.",
      "They are still waiting, though, for the \"golden tip\" that will lead them to the murderer, which comes with a 30,000-euro ($31,600) reward.",
      "\"Special way of getting attention\"",
      "According to Brink, the hologram is a \"special way of getting attention for this case\" -- including by putting it in De Wallen, which is \"one of the busiest places in Amsterdam and probably the whole of the Netherlands.\"",
      "This may not last, though, since Amsterdam's sex workers may soon lose the centrality and visibility of their windows.",
      "The local government plans to relocate the red-light district to a purpose-built centere south of the city in the hope of reducing petty crime and tourist footfall in De Wallen.",
      "The move is opposed by tens of thousands of locals and sex workers, who are calling instead for better crowd control and surveillance in the existing red-light area.",
      "Miranda K, a 57-year-old who lives near Amsterdam and declined to give her full surname, said the relocation plan was a \"pity\" because she felt \"safe\" in De Wallen.",
      "She said the out-of-city center would be in a \"dark\" area, whereas De Wallen has \"tourists and people and locals and everything here. So I think it's safer.\"",
      "\"For me, it's not just about finding Betty or who was Betty,\" she said, \"but it's about... these other ladies on the streets too.\"",
      "Ongoing effort to identify cold case victims across Europe",
      "The search for Betty comes amid a wider effort to solve cold cases in the Netherlands and beyond. Last month, Interpol launched a new campaign to identify 46 women whose remains have been found across Europe in unsolved cases, some dating back decades.",
      "The initiative from the Lyon-based organization builds on the success of the first Identify Me campaign, which last year helped identify the body of a woman\u00a0 -- dubbed the\u00a0\"woman with the flower tattoo\" -- found murdered 31 years ago in a Belgian river as Briton Rita Roberts.",
      "The original initiative\u00a0launched to identify 22 deceased women\u00a0saw some 1,800 tips received from the public.",
      "Now the\u00a0campaign has been expanded\u00a0to include cold cases from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as unexplained deaths from new participating countries France, Italy, and Spain.",
      "Most of the women were \"murdered or had died in suspicious or unexplained circumstances,\" the organization said.",
      "Among the women Interpol is seeking to identify is the body of a woman -- dubbed \"the woman in the suitcase\" -- with an estimated age of between 16 and 22. In the autumn of 2005, her corpse was found in a red suitcase lying in the canal in the town of Schiedam in the west of the Netherlands.",

    "story": [
      "President Biden has given the OK to lift restrictions that will allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided long-range weapons to strike deep into Russian territory, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Sunday. The move is a significant change to U.S. policy in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict.",
      "The easing of restrictions would allow Kyiv to use the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, to hit targets inside Russia. The move also comes as some 10,000 North Korean troops were sent to Kursk near Ukraine's northern border to help Russian forces retake territory.",
      "The White House National Security Council declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "The U.S. decision could help Ukraine at a moment when Russian forces appear to be making gains and could put Kyiv in a better negotiating position when and if peace talks happen.",
      "It also comes as Mr. Biden is about to leave office and President-elect Trump has pledged to limit American support for Ukraine and ending the war as soon as possible.",
      "In an interview with Ukrainian media outlet Suspilne on Friday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv would like to end the war with Russia next year through \"diplomatic means.\"",
      "He said he is certain that the war will end \"sooner\" than it otherwise would have once Mr. Trump becomes president.",
      "\"It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House. This is their approach, their promise to their citizens,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "February 2025 would mark the third year of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine with Russia's troops gaining ground in recent months.",
      "For several months, Zelenskyy and many of his Western supporters have been requesting to use U.S. weapons to hit Russian military targets far from its border, saying the U.S. ban had made it impossible for Ukraine to try to stop Russian attacks on its cities and electrical grids.",
      "Some congressional Republicans have urged Mr. Biden to loosen the rules on how Ukraine can use U.S.-provided weapons.",
      "News of Biden's decision followed\u00a0meetings over the last two days\u00a0with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China where North Korean troops were central to the talks, which took place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.",
      "Biden did not mention the decision during a speech at a stop to the Amazon rainforest in Brazil on his way to the Group of 20 summit.",
      "Asked about the decision, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a press conference that the body's position is \"to avoid a permanent deterioration of the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"We want peace, we want fair peace,\" Guterres said on Sunday ahead of the Group of 20 summit in Rio de Janeiro. He didn't elaborate.",
      "America is Ukraine's most valuable ally in the war, providing more than $56.2 billion in security assistance since Russian forces invaded in February 2022.",

At that time, there was no confirmation from the retailer itself. However, a breach notification site has now confirmed that the personal data of 56,904,909 users was found online and leaked from customers of Hot Topic, Torrid and Box Lunch.",

While Hot Topic, which operates more than 640 stores across the U.S., has yet to confirm the breach, HIBP reported that it occurred on Oct. 19. Just two days later, a threat actor using the alias \"Satanic\" claimed responsibility.",
      "Satanic alleges that the database contains details of 350 million users, though that number seems inflated. The leaked data does, however, include names, email addresses, physical addresses and dates of birth; all information collected through Hot Topic\u2019s loyalty program.

Hot Topic\u2019s silence could mean a few things, especially with such a big breach.

      "1) Keep a strong password:\u00a0With the Hot Topic data breach exposing sensitive information, it\u2019s essential to update your passwords. Use a strong, unique password for each account, especially for services where your personal details are stored. A mix of letters, numbers and symbols will make it harder for hackers to guess. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep everything secure and easily accessible.",
      "2) Beware of suspicious links:\u00a0After a breach, phishing attempts increase, and hackers may use your leaked email to send fake links or emails. Never click on suspicious links, especially those that ask for personal information. Always double-check the sender's email and look out for strange language or urgent requests. If in doubt, go directly to the website instead of following the links in the message.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Invest in a data removal service:\u00a0Since your personal information could be floating around on the dark web or public databases, it\u2019s a good idea to invest in a data removal service.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Watch out for the risk of identity theft:\u00a0The leaked data includes sensitive details like addresses, birthdays and purchase histories, which could be used for identity theft. Be extra cautious when sharing personal information moving forward, and if you notice anything unusual, report it immediately. If you are a Hot Topic customer, you might also want to consider an identity theft monitoring service.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Keep an eye on your bank accounts, credit card statements and even loyalty programs where your information is stored. Set up alerts for transactions and logins so you can act fast if anything seems off. Regular monitoring can help you catch fraudulent activity early, minimizing the damage if your data is misused.",

      "The Hot Topic data breach is alarming, especially since it affects over 56 million people. What makes the situation even more concerning is that Hot Topic has stayed silent about it. The company hasn\u2019t notified those affected, leaving many unprepared for potential cybersecurity threats. Hackers could use this gap to target victims with scams, leading to financial losses.

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 10:00:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson talks about T-Mobile being hacked in broad cyberattack on global phone and internet companies.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the National Security Agency advises weekly phone reboots to protect against cyberattacks and enhance mobile security.",
      "The telecom industry is one of cybercriminals' favorite targets, likely because of the sensitive data it stores. Your carrier knows who you call and what you text. This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter!",
      "T-Mobile booth (T-Mobile) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",
      "WSJ reported in October that Chinese hackers had access to the networks \"for months or longer,\" enabling them to collect \"internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small and millions of Americans as their customers.\"",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "T-Mobile\u2019s many data breaches",
      "T-Mobile has faced several hacks in recent years. In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data. Then, in January 2023, a misconfigured application programming interface exposed personal data for 37 million current customers, marking yet another significant security lapse.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "T-Mobile\u2019s response",
      "When CyberGuy reached out to T-Mobile regarding the latest security incident, a spokesperson provided the following statement: \"T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack. Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced. We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities.\"",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

    "published": "Sat, 16 Nov 2024 06:00:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson explains how a VPN \u2014 virtual private network \u2014 works and how running it can slow down the operation of your device.",
    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",

VPNs are fantastic tools for safeguarding data and unlocking restricted content, but that extra layer of protection and location masking can sometimes slow things down. The good news? There are several ways to keep your VPN running smoothly without sacrificing security.\u00a0 Let's dive in.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Make sure it's actually the VPN",
      "Before we blame the VPN, let's make sure it's really the culprit. Here's a quick test:",
      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",

VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",
      "3. Malware distribution: They will often have buttons, links or attachments included in the email. If you click the attachment, it can download malware or a virus to your device. If you click on a link that's provided in the email, it might take you to a website that will collect your personal and financial information or download malware or viruses to your device.",

      "The law would also allow property owners to call law enforcement to remove \"unauthorized residents\" from their properties, provided that there is no ongoing legal dispute related to the property between them.

      "\"I like the police having immunity, it's thrown on them to make the judgment \u2013\u00a0supposedly the homeowner can produce a deed or any kind of paperwork, but many times the squatter can produce the same kind of document,\" he said. \"It is difficult for the police or sheriff or whoever is dealing with it.\"",

      "\"Homeowners in exercising their rights and calling on the police would have to pay for the police. And if that is true, I think the legislature forgot that the homeowner already paid for the police as part of their taxes to provide safekeeping to the community at large.\"",

      "Florida's HB 621 also charges the homeowner a fee in this situation, as well as a \"civil eviction fee plus an hourly rate if a deputy must stand by and keep the peace while the unauthorized person is removed.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A pro-Trump former Florida prison warden who oversaw executions is urging President Biden to commute all federal and military death sentences before leaving office.",
      "\"I voted for President Trump in all of his campaigns, and I agree with him on most of his positions, but not the death penalty,\" Ron McAndrew, former warden of the Florida State Penitentiary, wrote in a letter to the outgoing president. \"I have written to President Trump personally to ask him to stop calling for more executions.\"",
      "McAndrew, a self-described \"law-and-order guy,\" Air Force veteran and pro-life Catholic, said that after overseeing three electric chair executions and witnessing five lethal injections, he grew to oppose the death penalty.",
      "While he had reservations from the start, he told Fox News Digital that he saw a burst of flames from the head of Pedro Medina during his execution in 1997 on the electric chair. That incident became a watershed moment in Florida and other parts of the country that marked the beginning of the end of electrocution.",
      "TRUMP EXECUTION RESTART TO PUT BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER, CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTER, MORE KILLERS IN HOT SEAT",
      "Ron McAndrew, a former Florida prison warden, testifies during a 2019 hearing regarding a death row inmate. (Doug Engle/Ocala Star-Banner)",
      "\"A plume of smoke and then a flame that came down underneath the helmet and out right in front of my face, had it come a few inches further, it would have actually burned me,\" he said.",
      "Later, he said the stench was so overpowering that, \"it was like we had gone to a human barbecue.\"",
      "State investigators found that Medina, a convicted murderer and Cuban refugee, had died instantly \u2013 but the incident traumatized McAndrew and at least two dozen other witnesses, he said.",
      "The incident led Florida to adopt lethal injections instead, but he said that form of execution was no less disturbing for the prison workers who carried it out.",
      "TRUMP EXPECTED TO END BIDEN-ERA DEATH PENALTY PAUSE, EXPAND TO MORE FEDERAL INMATES",
      "Pedro Medina, a convicted killer, was sentenced to death and went to the electric chair on March 25, 1997. He was one of the last inmates electrocuted in this manner after his head burst into flames, filling the chamber with smoke and horrifying onlookers. (Archive PL / Alamy Stock Photo)",
      "\"The heaving of the chest is an example,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"You can see it if you're up close, and you're the executioner or a member of the team. You can see that they're trying to break out of their own body, so to speak. But the witnesses don't see this. They see it as, like, a clean, a sanitary form of killing someone.\"",
      "At one point, he said, he began seeing executed inmates in his sleep and drinking heavily \u2013 half a bottle of Johnnie Walker a night \u2013 as a result. Eventually, he was diagnosed with severe stress. Now he is a staunch supporter of abolishing the death penalty.",
      "Read the letter here:",
      "\"I feel compelled to say there is one thing in particular that I agree about with President Biden,\" McAndrew wrote in his letter. \"We share a strong opposition to the death penalty. President Biden has the power to show mercy through the process of executive clemency, and I urge that he do so expeditiously for everyone on the federal and military death rows.\"",
      "When asked why the worst of the worst killers on death row, including Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof and Pittsburgh synagogue gunman Robert Bowers, should have their lives spared, he questioned where we should draw the line and suggested incarcerating them all with no possibility of parole instead.",

      "\"If this same inmate was doing life without possibility of parole, he'd be working between 40 and 60 hours per week whether he liked it or not,\" he said. \"He would be making a contribution\u2026rather than being a burden on the taxpayers, sitting in a cell getting room service for 25 years.\"",

      "\"We're excited to have a cabinet level official focused on government efficiency, because this is the first time anyone in the federal government is positioned to eliminate the death penalty by executive order,\" Bonowitz said. \"There is no current government program more wasteful, ineffective and inefficient than capital punishment.\"",
      "The letter comes as Trump has vowed to not only end Biden's moratorium on capital punishment, but also to expand the list of crimes that can be punishable with execution to include child rape, human trafficking and the murder of U.S. citizens by illegal immigrants.",
      "There are currently 40 inmates on federal death row, and they include domestic terrorists, drug kingpins and criminals who had witnesses against them killed.",
      "Tsarnaev, who killed four and wounded hundreds; Roof, who killed nine at a Bible study; Bowers, who killed 11 at the Tree of Life Synagogue; and Kaboni Savage, a Philadelphia drug lord who killed 12 people \u2013\u00a0including four children linked to an informant \u2013\u00a0would all see clemency under the proposal.",

That is far fewer than the individual states, which have executed more than 1,500 condemned inmates in the last 50 years.",

      "In places like California, where death row inmates are safe from execution due to a moratorium against capital punishment, they also have access to elite attorneys and all the time in the world to try and fight their circumstances.",

      "The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) approved New York Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s congestion pricing program for Midtown and Lower Manhattan on Monday, in a 12-1 vote.",
      "Congestion pricing would commence in January, and institute a video-enforced toll on newly-built gantries surrounding the city\u2019s core. Traffic moving below 60th Street and Central Park, and entering from New Jersey, Brooklyn or Queens \u2014 except for via the RFK Triboro Bridge and George Washington Bridge \u2014 would be subject to the toll.",
      "Hochul previously said she would like to see a slightly lower price point than the original $15 \u2014 around $9, citing inflation \u2014 and MTA Chairman Janno Lieber suggested last week that he was open to seeing whether a lower toll could achieve the same revenue goals.",
      "On Monday, the MTA agreed to a phased-in congestion pricing plan that will ultimately result in Manhattan drivers getting hit with a higher priced toll by 2031.",

      "Lieber called the return of congestion pricing \"huge for the MTA,\" arguing that those who utilize public transit or drive into the city, as well as businesses, would benefit from the plan because it will reduce traffic.",
      "\"It\u2019s a hopeful moment for drivers as well as for transit riders and for everybody, because life can and should get a lot better if you have to drive to New York, if you elect to drive to New York, if you\u2019re not spending as much time in congestion,\" he said. \"If you can save 10, 20 or even 30 minutes, your time is money.\"",
      "While Lieber said he is hopeful for positive benefits of congestion pricing, critics claim the pricing is a tax on hard-working New Yorkers and commuters who drive into Manhattan.",

      "Still, Lieber countered the opposition, claiming about 143,000 motorists enter the congestion toll zone daily compared to the 6.5 million people who use public transportation.",
      "As for the money, Lieber told reporters after the vote that the approved $9 toll will still allow the MTA to generate $15 billion to put toward capital projects, though it may take a little longer than expected from a $15 toll.",
      "But with Hochul\u2019s full endorsement, he explained, the MTA has the certainty that it will be fully funded for projects. Lieber added that there will not be significant delays in completing major capital projects on the transit system.",

      "Hochul, a Democrat, halted her long-held plan for congestion pricing after initial backlash against state Democrats. But now, some of the Democrats in New York have warned that Trump may kill their revenue stream.",

      "\"Congestion pricing, the latest in a long string of tyrannical taxes, has been pressed forward through consistent opposition about the burden on New York families and workers, the timing of the effort, areas lacking adequate transit, the fiscal responsibility of the move, the negative impact that congestion pricing will have on residents of some of the lowest-income neighborhoods in New York City and more,\" they wrote.",

      "The lawmakers claimed Hochul is acting now because the move failed to engender goodwill to elected Democrats this past election, adding that the MTA \u2014 which falls under state auspices \u2014 is running a massive deficit in part due to fare evasion and internal waste and fraud.",

The relationship is going to be approached in a more comprehensive way. I don't see that the Mexican government is preparing for that.\"",

      "All four of Baltimore\u2019s losses this season have been in one-possession games. And in all four of those losses, kicker Justin Tucker has missed at least one field goal.",
      "Kickers missing kicks is not a new phenomenon \u2014 unless that kicker is Tucker.",
      "Entering the 2024 season, Tucker was the most accurate field-goal kicker in NFL history, converting 90.2% of his attempts, the only player at or above the 90% threshold. His accuracy has taken a tumble this season, however, as Tucker has made only 16 of 22 field goals through 11 games.",
      "It\u2019s a shocking fall from grace from a player who had become a legitimate weapon for Baltimore.",
      "Tucker\u2019s field-goal percentage this season is 72.7% \u2014 35th in the league. Not only has that dropped him under 90% for his career, it is by far the worst accuracy he\u2019s ever had in a single season. His previous low was 82.5% in 2015. From 2016-23, Tucker made at least 85% of his kicks in eight straight seasons, an NFL record.",
      "Tucker has already missed six kicks in 11 games this season. From 2012-23, Tucker missed at least six kicks in a full season only twice.",
      "More from Sports",

      "'Monday Night Football' highlights: Joe Mixon scores 3 TDs as Texans dominate Cowboys in Dallas",
      "TNT's 'Inside the NBA' headed for ESPN and ABC after Warner Bros. Discovery settlement",
      "From 2016-22, Tucker made 65 field goals in a row in the fourth quarter and overtime. He has made an NFL record seven game-winning kicks with no time left on the clock in regulation. He also has the record for longest kick in NFL history, 66 yards, which also happened to be a walk-off game winner.",
      "From 2016-23, Tucker converted 78% of his field goals from over 50 yards. In the last two seasons, he\u2019s made only 33.3% of his kicks from that distance.",
      "\u201c[Tucker] needs to make kicks. He knows that, that\u2019s important,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after the loss Sunday. \u201cHe makes them in practice, and he made the long one later, which was good to see, which means he\u2019s still very capable. Kick them straight, we\u2019ll be good.\u201d",
      "Baltimore is almost certainly going to need Tucker to contribute at a higher level moving forward. Even with MVP-caliber play from Lamar Jackson and a rushing attack fortified by offseason signing veteran running back Derrick Henry, kickers can swing games. (Kansas City's Harrison Butker, for example, is one spot behind Tucker on the all-time field-goal accuracy list. He hit all 11 of his playoff field goals for the Super Bowl-winning Chiefs last season.)",
      "The Ravens, for now, are standing by their longtime kicker. When asked Monday if the team would bring in a player to compete with Tucker, Harbaugh said the team has no plans to do so.",
      "\u201cThe best option right now is to get Justin back on point because he is fully capable of doing it,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t lost any confidence in Justin Tucker.\u201d",
      "Even on Sunday, after arguably costing his team the game, Tucker wasn\u2019t shaken.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still confident I\u2019m going to go out there and nail every single kick,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cPart of the way we stay confident is by continuing to work and trust the process. I might sound like a broken record, but it\u2019s a part of what brings us success, is just trusting the process and then taking it one kick at a time.\u201d"

      "It's certainly eye-catching: A group of multiracial, gender-bending models emerge from an elevator in cutting-edge makeup and bright-colored clothing to a techno-industrial beat into an austere, prismatic landscape.",
      "But one thing is missing from the storied British carmaker Jaguar's new rebrand: cars.",
      "The spot has drawn some reactions online that range from puzzled to dismayed, with several commentators comparing the potential fallout to Bud Light's use of a trans influencer in straying far afield from its core demographic.",
      "One communications professional on X called the advertisement \"disastrous\" for being overly focused on branding and not on the product itself.",
      "\"Jaguar should be saying ... some version of 'our cars are engineered to the gills and go very very fast,'\" wrote Lulu Cheng Meservey, co-founder of Rostra PR group. \"Art school grads simply aren\u2019t associated with elite engineering ability, I\u2019m sorry.\"",
      "In a press release accompanying its rebrand, Jaguar's chief creative officer, Sir Gerry McGovern, explained the thinking behind the rollout.",
      "\"New Jaguar is a brand built around exuberant modernism,\" he said. \"It is imaginative, bold and artistic at every touchpoint. It is unique and fearless.\" Jaguar sold fewer than 67,000 cars in the entire world last year, approximately half the number it sold in the fiscal year incorporating the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Today there are just 122 Jaguar dealerships in the U.S., down from a peak of around 200, according to Car and Driver magazine.",
      "The revamp is designed to turn things around, in part by introducing new emblems that will be featured on future Jaguar vehicles.",

      "\"To bring back such a globally renowned brand we had to be fearless,\" Rawdon Glober, Jaguar's managing director, said in the release. \"Jaguar was always at its best when challenging convention. That ethos is seen in our new brand identity today and will be further revealed over the coming months. This is a complete reset. Jaguar is transformed to reclaim its originality and inspire a new generation. I am excited for the world to finally see Jaguar.\""

    "story": [
      "JACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Seven years ago, Chokwe Antar Lumumba swept into the Jackson mayor\u2019s office with plans to shake up local politics. At 34, he was the city\u2019s youngest ever mayor, and he campaigned on a promise of self-determination for the predominantly Black city.",
      "Now Lumumba, 41, stands accused in a sprawling corruption scandal that has also ensnared Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens and City Council members Aaron Banks and Angelique Lee.  Lumumba, Owens and Banks have pleaded not guilty. Lee, who resigned in August, pleaded guilty and awaits sentencing.",
      "Some officials fear the indictments could overshadow the city\u2019s efforts to improve residents\u2019 quality of life \u2014 or undermine local leadership.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just praying that the legislators and state leadership can see beyond these indictments and realize that we still need help from the state in getting some very specific things done,\u201d City Council President Virgi Lindsay said.",
      "While Lindsay hopes the state will still provide funds for necessary improvements to infrastructure and blight, she acknowledged the request is coming at a fraught time.",
      "Even before the indictments, the state\u2019s Republican leadership had pushed for greater control of the city\u2019s affairs. Political observers say this new crisis could intensify a long-running battle between the state\u2019s mostly white Republican elected officials and the city\u2019s largely Black Democratic leadership.",
      "\u201cRace is always a factor. It\u2019s an ongoing factor in Mississippi politics,\u201d said Leslie McLemore, a former Jackson State University political science professor who also once sat on the Jackson City Council. \u201cYou cannot in a very real sense separate Mississippi history in general from the tensions you find in the city of Jackson,\u201d McLemore went on to add. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing saga.\u201d",
      "Jackson is Mississippi\u2019s largest city. But with roughly 144,000 residents, it is also small enough that constituents have a decent chance of running into local politicians around town.",
      "\u201cAll of these folks were well-trusted, well-liked individuals,\u201d said Bishop Ronnie Crudup Sr., the head pastor of New Horizon Church International in Jackson. \u201cWhen you have servants from the mayor to City Council members to the local DA all being indicted, that\u2019s a tremendous hit for the city.\u201d",
      "Jackson has already taken plenty of them. In 2022, a water crisis caused residents to go without clean water for days on end. That was on top of years of boil-water notices that eroded residents\u2019 trust in the city\u2019s water supply. Then, last year, Jacksonians went without municipal trash collection for roughly two weeks amid a contract dispute. And while some violent crimes have dropped, the homicide rate is still among the nation\u2019s highest.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even shock anymore,\u201d Kim Meeks, who runs a locksmith shop in Jackson\u2019s Fondren neighborhood with her husband, said about the indictment. \u201cWhen\u2019s the next shoe going to drop?\u201d",
      "Federal prosecutors have alleged the officials accepted, or in Owens\u2019 case facilitated, bribe payments from out-of-state developers pitching a hotel project in downtown Jackson. Unbeknownst to them, the men were undercover FBI agents, according to a recently unsealed indictment. The mayor\u2019s office declined to comment; calls to Owens\u2019 attorneys, Banks and Lee were not returned.",
      "\u201cI know the state does not trust the administration of the city of Jackson,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Zakiya Summers, whose district includes parts of Jackson. Summers, who took office in 2020, said she is used to seeing \u201canti-Jackson\u201d legislation come across her desk, referring to what she called the state\u2019s push for oversight of city resources.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Governor Tate Reeves did not respond to questions about the relationship between the city and state. She referred to his Nov. 7 comments on the indictments, where he called the charges \"serious.\"",
      "\"It is early in the process and because it is an ongoing criminal matter, I don\u2019t believe I should make any other comment,\" Reeves told reporters.",
      "The House Speaker and Lt. Governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In April, a push by conservative legislators to strip local control of the city\u2019s water system failed for the second time in the House. More recently, a state-run police force has expanded its presence in Jackson. Last year, residents and civil groups also protested House Bill 1020, legislation sponsored by Republican lawmakers that would mandate the creation of a new court for Hinds County, of which Jackson is part, with a special judge and\u00a0prosecutors appointed by state officials.",
      "Supporters of the court say\u00a0it will promote public safety, but Lumumba called the bill \u201can attack on Black leadership,\u201d and the U.S. Justice Department and the NAACP weighed in on the city\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cH.B. 1020 intentionally discriminates against minority voters in Hinds County by creating a system of judicial and prosecutorial appointments specifically designed to undermine the historical power of Black residents, through their elected officials, to self-govern,\u201d they said in a complaint.",
      "A federal judge dismissed the NAACP\u2019s efforts to block the court in December; appointments for the court have not yet been announced.",
      "Next year\u2019s legislative session will overlap with primaries in the mayor\u2019s race, which could be more competitive for Lumumba than either of his two previous races.",
      "Some of his popularity stems from his revered father, Chokwe Lumumba, a civil rights activist, who was known on a national stage for calling for reparations, representing Black revolutionaries and successfully defending Tupac Shakur against assault charges.",
      "The elder Lumumba became mayor of Jackson in 2013 but died suddenly at age 66 only eight months into his term. His son announced his plans to run later that year, vowing to continue fighting for the city.",
      "\u201cI propose that the people didn\u2019t just vote for a man, they voted for a vision and for a movement,\u201d he told The Clarion-Ledger newspaper at the time. \u201cAnd no person is better suited to move that vision forward than myself, who co-authored it.\u201d",
      "Jacksonians will soon decide whether they still support that vision.",
      "Before his indictment, Lumumba announced his intentions to run again. Outside his arraignment, his sister, Rukia Lumumba, said those plans had not changed. He could face a crowded Democratic primary.",
      "Annie Cooper, 74, a retiree who lives in Northwest Jackson, said she voted for Lumumba in the past but has not decided whether she will again.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for people to do things in a professional manner,\u201d she said, regarding the management of the city. \u201cIf it\u2019s not run in a certain way, it just gives the state more reason to take over.\u201d",
      "Byron D'Andra Orey, a political science professor at Jackson State University, said the bribery scandal could shape the municipal elections. \u201cHe\u2019s innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t help his candidacy given the challenges Jackson faces. The negative attention it brings to his administration compounds what\u2019s already there.\u201d",
      "The Rev. CJ Rhodes, who leads Mount Helm Baptist Church in Jackson, said he was \u201cgrieved\u201d by the indictments but hopes the moment could prompt a change.",
      "\u201cThere could be people in the city of Jackson who remind us of our greatness and see this crisis more as an opportunity than as a death sentence,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is a great opportunity to convert the darkness rather than curse it.\u201d"

      "Monsignor Jamie Gigantiello, of Our Lady of Mount Carmel \u2014 Annunciation Parish, no longer holds any pastoral oversight or governance role at the parish, Bishop Robert J. Brennan of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn said in a statement Monday.",
      "The decision followed an investigation after the parish was\u00a0subpoenaed amid New York City Mayor Eric Adams' corruption scandal, NBC New York reported.",
      "The Diocese said the investigation \"uncovered a pattern of serious violations of Diocesan policies and protocols by Monsignor Gigantiello.\"",
      "The Diocese accused the monsignor of transferring a total of $1.9 million in parish funds to bank accounts affiliated with the law firm of Frank Carone, as well as two companies affiliated with him. Carone was at one point the chief of staff to Adams, according to NBC New York.",
      "In January 2019, Gigantiello allegedly transferred $1 million of parish funds to Carone\u2019s law firm, the Diocese said. Gigantiello failed to inform the Diocese of the transfer or seek required prior approval, the statement said.

    "story": [
      "Jay Z's Team Roc, the social justice arm of his Roc Nation entertainment company, filed a lawsuit Tuesday claiming Kansas City, Kansas, has violated public records laws by failing to \"timely produce\" law enforcement records related to decadeslong allegations of police abuse and misconduct.",
      "The suit, filed in Wyandotte County District Court in partnership with the Midwest Innocence Project, says the Kansas City Police Department has not released substantial documents related to complaints pertaining to current and former detectives and officers after Roc Nation submitted a records request in November 2023.",
      "\"For decades, communities in Kansas City, Kansas \u2014 particularly minority and immigrant communities \u2014 have been subjected to an alarming pattern of abuse and other serious misconduct by the KCKPD,\" according to the suit, which was first obtained by NBC News.",
      "\"Rather than promoting a culture of transparency and accountability, the KCKPD has a long history of turning a blind eye to (at best) and even covering up (if not worse) abusive and/or corrupt conduct by its officers,\" the suit adds.",
      "The\u00a0complaint against the Kansas City Police Department and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, alleges they have \"stonewalled\" the plaintiffs for almost a year. As part of its request under the Kansas Open Records Act, the plaintiffs said they were initially charged $2,200 in fees, which they agreed to pay.",
      "But to date, according to the plaintiffs, the 225 documents provided are mostly personnel locator records showing officer shifts and assignments and a smaller handful consisting of training materials and department policies. There has not been one document related to \"any complaint or investigation into even a single instance of misconduct by any member of the KCKPD,\" as requested, the suit says.",
      "The city's police force has come under scrutiny over allegations of corruption and civil rights violations in recent years. Activists have called for a broader federal investigation, particularly in light of the alleged abuses under former Kansas City police Det. Roger\u00a0Golubski,\u00a0who in September 2022 was charged with federal civil rights crimes after he was accused of exploiting Black women for sex and framing people for crimes they say they did not commit.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Team Roc's managing director, Dania Diaz, said they only received personnel documents related to three out of 16 requests and some requests have not been sufficiently answered in a reasonable amount of time under the law.",
      "She said they believe litigation is warranted to compel action and to ultimately bring accountability to a department where officers' actions have come under scrutiny: \"This filing is because human beings with badges have betrayed the public's trust \u2026 That type of behavior must be held to a standard.\"",
      "Kansas City police didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit, and the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas, declined to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The state's public records law does maintain that certain documents are exempt from public review, including personnel information of public employees and criminal investigation records.",
      "But the plaintiffs contend that the unified government denied its request in \"broad, undifferentiated strokes,\" and \"failed to distinguish between records relating to pending and closed investigations and failed to acknowledge that virtually all legitimate privacy concerns could be resolved through redactions.\"",
      "They add that the significant sum paid to the government, in what they were told would be an \"extensive\" and \"voluminous\" request, was met with boilerplate language they believe does not comply with the law.",
      "\"More important, the Unified Government's blanket assertion about 'unfounded allegations' is insufficient and reveals the heart of the problem when the public trust in law enforcement is broken,\" the suit says.",
      "The plaintiffs are seeking a judge to intervene and order the records to be produced within 30 days.",
      "Max Kautsch, a First Amendment rights lawyer in Lawrence, Kansas, said the state's open records law turns on whether disclosure of a document is in the public interest. There's a legitimate argument to be made that records related to police misconduct can \"shed light\" on how the public is being served, he added.",
      "Although Kansas' law is \"liberally construed to promote openness when there's ambiguity\" over whether a record is public, law enforcement records related to criminal complaints are routinely denied, Kautsch said.",
      "Team Roc's interest in Kansas City transpired after learning from local media in 2021 that the FBI had found numerous allegations of civil rights violations of officer misconduct and excessive force dating back to the 1990s.",
      "In 2022, Team Roc sued the department and took out a full-page ad in The Washington Post calling for an investigation. Team Roc attorney Alex Spiro wrote to the Justice Department that a \"blue wall of silence\" had allowed alleged misconduct to fester over decades.",
      "Following Golubski's arrest, Team Roc and other organizations rallied to get the Justice Department to launch a police \"pattern and practice\" investigation in Kansas City, Kansas, where about half the population is Black and Latino. That has not happened, although an investigation was opened in neighboring Kansas City, Missouri, regarding alleged discrimination within its police force of Black officers.",
      "That investigation has had little traction, according to the Kansas City Star, dimming hopes among some police reform advocates and community groups that the Justice Department under a Trump administration would review police in Kansas City, Kansas, as well. Under the first Trump administration, the department all but abandoned broad civil rights investigations into police forces.",
      "Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his potential plans for the Justice Department's police investigations.",
      "Meanwhile, attention on Kansas City, Kansas, police is expected to return next month, when Golubski's trial is scheduled to begin. Golubski, who\u00a0retired in 2010 after 35 years on the force, pleaded not guilty to six counts of deprivation of civil rights.",
      "Kansas City police didn't immediately respond to a request about community concerns. The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Kansas City Police Chief Karl Oakman has previously said he would comply with any investigation, but Diaz contends there hasn't been any willingness on the department's part to be more transparent.",
      "\"We strongly believe that everyone wants to live in a society where they feel safe,\" she said. \"We are open to speaking to anyone who cares, and if this is not resolved before [Trump] takes office, we will work with the new administration to hopefully get a resolution that's decades long awaited.\""

    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 19:23:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Susan Smith was convicted of killing her two children in South Carolina in 1994. After almost 30 years behind bars she is eligible for release.",
    "story": [
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Susan Smith, who shocked the nation 30 years ago when she rolled her car into a lake with her two children inside and watched them drown, will ask a parole board Wednesday to release her from prison.",
      "Smith will testify virtually to the seven-person panel about why she believes she is ready to re-enter society. The board must approve parole with a simple majority vote in order to release her.",
      "Almost 30 years ago to the day, Susan Smith made international headlines when she said she was carjacked late at night near Union, South Carolina, by a Black man.",
      "She told police the man drove away with her 3-year-old son, Michael, and 14-month-old son, Alex, inside. Her report led to a nine-day manhunt during which Smith and her estranged husband, David Smith, pleaded on national TV for their safe return.",
      "The case drew massive media attention, including Susan Smith saying on NBC's \"TODAY\" show that, \u201cas a mother, it\u2019s only a natural instinct to protect your children from any harm, and the hardest part of this whole ordeal is not knowing if your children are getting what they need to survive and it hurts.\u201d",
      "Just hours after the Nov. 3, 1994, interview, Smith confessed to killing her sons, admitting to police that she had let her car roll into a nearby lake with the boys inside, watching as they drowned.",
      "At her trial the next year, prosecutors argued that Smith killed her sons because of a relationship with a wealthy man who ended it because he did not want children. Smith's attorneys argued she was the victim of sexual assault by her stepfather and was suffering a mental breakdown when she killed her sons.",
      "She was found guilty of murder and the jury sentenced her to life in prison, although prosecutors had sought the death penalty.",
      "Smith, now 53, has had an eventful three decades behind bars in South Carolina, including multiple disciplinary actions. Her first infraction occurred in 1997 when she was caught with contraband, a razor.",
      "In 2000, she was moved from the Women\u2019s Correctional Center after two prison guards pleaded guilty to having sexual encounters with her. Lt. Houston Cagle and Capt. Alfred R. Rowe Jr. were convicted of having sex with an inmate, following an investigation into prison guard conduct, according to Richland County criminal court records.",
      "The following year, Smith violated rules by not standing for count and was restricted to her cell for 45 days.\u00a0In 2010 and 2015, she was penalized with disciplinary detention and the loss of canteen privileges for using drugs, including marijuana, according to the South Carolina Department of Corrections.",
      "Last month, Smith was convicted of an internal disciplinary charge after speaking with a documentary filmmaker in August. According to the incident report, Smith \u201cdiscussed in depth the crime and the events leading up to and after it actually took place, including such details to what was in the trunk of the car when it went into the water and her plans to jump from a bridge while holding the boys but one woke up\u2026 Inmate Smith is profiting from her crime.\u201d",
      "She lost her telephone, tablet and canteen privileges for 90 days.",
      "While in prison, Smith has continued to argue in her defense. In a 2015 letter to The State newspaper in South Carolina, she wrote: \u201cSomething went very wrong that night. I was not myself. I was a good mother and I loved my boys... There was no motive as it was not even a planned event. I was not in my right mind\u2026 I am not the monster society thinks I am.\u201d",
      "Under state law, Smith became eligible for parole on Nov. 4. The board grants parole to about 8% of violent offenders, according to publicly available data. As of Monday, 471 people had written to the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services regarding Smith's hearing. Only six of the letters were in favor of her release.",
      "One of the jurors from her trial three decades ago,\u00a0Willie Rice, said Tuesday that Smith has \"done her time.\"",
      "\"The one thing that has always stuck in my head is would I be able to except her back in society , a question the prosecutor at the time asked before I became a juror,\" Rice said. \"My answer is still yes.\"",
      "David Smith, now her ex-husband and the father of Michael and Alex, said he plans to address the parole board Wednesday to oppose her release. Former lead prosecutor and current South Carolina State Rep. Tommy Pope is also expected to speak in opposition.",
      "Pope recently told\u00a0The State, \u201cI feel strongly that the death penalty was appropriate.\u201d He has said he believes the jury did not know a life sentence would give Smith the possibility of parole.",
      "Even the ex-prison guard who was found guilty of having sex with Smith in 2000\u00a0told NewsNation recently, \u201c[Smith\u2019s] prison record shows that she\u2019s not really learned anything,\u201d other than \u201chow to do illegal drugs.\u201d",
      "If she were granted parole, Smith would have to meet pre-release conditions regarding employment, residence, programming and detainers. If denied release, she could reapply in two years."

      "The cinematic retelling of the famed Broadway musical has sparked a debate online among die-hard fans about whether it\u2019s appropriate to belt along with the on-screen cast while at the movies.",
      "Moviegoers who spoke to NBC News said they expect excited \u201ctheater kids\u201d to know the etiquette of not singing over the actors during the show. Many said they plan to lip sync, but that they would save the actual singing along for another time.",
      "\u201cYou would never sing in a Broadway theater,\u201d said Alex Lewis, a longtime member of the off-Broadway community who was among the many people who posted his take on the debate on TikTok. He and his band, Lewberger, posted a short song joking about the discourse last month.",

However, when it comes to movie theater etiquette, the conversation has largely centered around people using their devices during the film.",
      "In the past, some moviegoers have welcomed singing out loud. When the \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d film hit theaters, singing and dancing appeared to be encouraged after a scramble for expensive tickets left some without an opportunity to see the tour in person.",

      "Williams is among the contingent of \u201cWicked\u201d fans who think singing along in a theater wouldn\u2019t be the worst offense. Though she\u2019s still not sure if she\u2019ll be the first to break into song.",

      "For \u201cInterior Chinatown\u201d star Jimmy O. Yang, playing an invisible Chinatown extra in the new series hit close to home. That\u2019s because one of Yang\u2019s first roles was \u201cChinese Teenager #1.\u201d",
      "The irony helped him relate to his character, Willis Wu, and plays out in the series about a struggling Chinatown waiter who is pulled into investigating his brother\u2019s disappearance, airing on Hulu on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cInterior Chinatown,\u201d based on the National Book Award-winning novel of the same name by Charles Yu, is technically a show within a show. The leads \u2014 Yang, Chloe Bennet and Ronny Chieng \u2014 play \u201cChinatown\u201d extras within a police procedural called \u201cBlack and White.\u201d They are largely ignored by everyone in the procedural until the lights fade and the cameras go away, bringing viewers back to the characters\u2019 Chinatown realities.",
      "In the show\u2019s meta world, Yang is a lead actor playing a background character. His character, Willis, sneaks into \u201cBlack and White\u201d by disguising himself as the tech guy and the Chinese food deliveryman, using these stereotypes to his advantage.",
      "\u201cWe get put in a box,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey expect you to know kung fu, they expect you to be a good student, or the model minority tech guy.\u201d",
      "For Yang, who has mostly played comedic roles, getting to embody multiple characters at once was creatively rewarding. \u201cI love subverting expectations \u2014 that\u2019s what the show is about, and that\u2019s what my career has been about,\u201d Yang said.",
      "He appreciates how the show lifts the curtain on the lives of sidelined characters, and how Chinatown is a metaphor for how he says America flattens certain communities. \u201cWe\u2019re shown the facades, the Chinese words, the kitschy restaurants, but what you don\u2019t usually see is behind the scenes,\u201d he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Chieng\u2019s character, Fatty Choi, remains a defender of Chinatown. Though Willis learns to jump between the worlds of \u201cBlack and White\u201d and Chinatown, Fatty stubbornly refuses to leave the Chinese restaurant where the two friends work. \u201c[Fatty] represents this idea of not pandering to a white society that doesn\u2019t even see you or want you around,\u201d Chieng said.",
      "Another character who navigates both worlds is Detective Lana Lee, played by Bennet. In \u201cBlack and White,\u201d Lee is a biracial cop who is simultaneously treated as a valuable \u201cChinatown insider\u201d and is constantly dismissed by her counterparts as an outsider. Bennet said as an actor, she paid special attention to the lighting cues, wardrobe and the way Lana carried herself in different contexts.\u00a0\u201cWe were really strategic with when to highlight the fact that I came from both worlds,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cLana uses that kind of code switching as a way to manipulate and deflect throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Bennet has discussed publicly how Hollywood struggles to understand her biraciality. She said playing a character that embodied her racial frustrations has been a cathartic experience. \u201cI felt so seen by the way Charlie [Yu] wrote her inner dialogue,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I needed to play her and how much of her story is still so relevant to my life.\u201d",
      "Chieng said that by satirizing Hollywood\u2019s failures, the show makes a point about the larger society we live in. He hopes viewers will walk away with more curiosity about the lives of people behind the scenes. \u201cWe need to pay attention to who\u2019s in the background, and recognize them as people who have their own stories, their own tragedies and their own goals,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Norway's royal family found itself embroiled in an intensifying scandal Tuesday after the son of the country's crown princess was arrested on suspicion of rape.",
      "Marius Borg Hoiby, 27, was arrested Monday on a preliminary charge of having \"sexual intercourse with someone who is unconscious or for other reasons is unable to resist the act,\" police in the capital, Oslo, said in a statement early Tuesday.",
      "He was also charged with one count of \"abuse in close relationships,\" violating a restraining order, and driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, police said Tuesday.",
      "A preliminary charge comes before a formal charge, and allows law enforcement to detain a suspect for further investigation.",
      "They add to the growing list of charges against the Oslo socialite, the eldest child of Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit from a relationship prior to her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon.",
      "He is currently being held by police in Oslo.",
      "Borg Hoiby pleaded not guilty to the charge, and was cooperating with the police and wanted to explain himself, his defense attorney Oyvind Bratlien told Norwegian state broadcaster NRK on Tuesday. His attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe do not have a comment on this case and direct all questions to police and attorney for Marius Borg Hoiby,\u201d Simen Sund, Communications Advisor for the Royal Palace,\u00a0told NBC News by phone on Tuesday.",
      "It was the police who brought the provisional rape charge, not the alleged victim, her lawyer Hege Salomon told Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten. Salomon said the woman \u201chas no relation with the other women in the case,\u201d and \u201cis having a hard time.\u201d",
      "Borg Hoiby is being investigated over allegations of abuse from four women.",
      "He was first arrested in August of this year after a violent incident at an apartment in the capitol's Frogner neighborhood, over which he has pleaded guilty to charges of bodily harm and property damage.  Police said the suspicions relating to the August incident included domestic abuse.",
      "He has also pleaded guilty to charges of having made a death threat against a man in separate incident. And Borg Hoiby has pleaded not-guilty to separate charges related to two past relationships.",
      "According to police, when he was arrested Monday Borg Hoiby was in a car with the alleged victim from the August incident.",
      "Borg Hoiby apologized for the events leading up to his August arrest in a statement to NRK at the time, blaming it on \"being intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine after an argument\" and \"several mental illnesses\" for which he planned to \"resume treatment.\"",
      "He was four when his mother married Prince Haakon in 2001, and despite not being an official member of the royal family, has attended events and lived on royal property with his mother, stepfather and two half-siblings, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus.",
      "During the royal couple's engagement, Mette-Marit was criticized in the media as an inappropriate choice for future queen due to having had a child with a man convicted of drug possession, and her own \"wild past\" involving rumored partying and drug-taking.",
      "Mette-Marit responded with a televised news conference the week before the 2001 wedding, in which she condemned drugs and apologized for having \"lived a dissolute life\" before meeting the prince, and was ultimately praised by the media for her \"Cinderella\" story.",
      "Borg Hoiby has previously been in the spotlight for selling designer items on a Norwegian reselling app and listing the address as the royal palace. He played a walk-on role on a popular Norwegian teenage television show, and even appeared in an American Vogue feature in 2018 giving tips on the most stylish spots to spend time in Oslo.",
      "He is a mainstay of Norwegian tabloid media along with his stepfather's elder sister Princess Martha Louise, who married an American self-proclaimed \"shaman\" in August and has claimed that she can communicate with angels."

      "There was no photo finish for President Joe Biden.",
      "The outgoing American leader arrived for a family picture with world leaders during his final Group of 20 summit Monday, only to find the photo had already been taken without him.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer were among those who did make it, smiling and raising linked hands for the traditional summit set piece.",
      "A senior U.S. official attributed the mix-up in Rio de Janeiro to logistical challenges.",
      "\u201cDue to logistical issues, they took the family photo early before all the leaders had arrived. So a number of leaders weren\u2019t actually there when they took the photo,\u201d said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Biden was nowhere to be found until just after the photo was taken, when photographers and reporters began searching frantically for him.",
      "One cameraman spotted him behind a nearby palm tree alongside Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Trudeau and Meloni also missed the photo.",

      "\u201cWe have a system, fundamentally, that\u2019s predicated on one president at a time,\u201d said Jon Finer, deputy national security adviser. \u201cPresident Biden is that president, he will be handing off power in January, and it will be up to a new administration to decide what to do with it.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Biden himself acknowledged the limited time left in office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m leaving office in January,\u201d he said. \u201cI will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.\u201d",
      "The G20 summit involves the heads of state or government of 19 member countries and two regional bodies: the African Union and the European Union.",
      "The member countries represent around 85% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, more than 75% of world trade and around two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, according to the forum.",
      "The G20 was established in 1999 in response to the Asian financial crisis, initially serving as a forum for finance ministers and central bank officials to discuss economic stability.",
      "It has since evolved into a high-level meeting of heads of state and government."

    "summary": "A Hong Kong court sentenced dozens of leading pro-democracy figures to prison under a national security law that critics say has been used to suppress dissent.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 A Hong Kong court sentenced dozens of leading pro-democracy figures to up to 10 years in prison Tuesday in the single largest trial under a national security law that critics say has been used to all but eliminate political dissent in the Chinese territory.",
      "Benny Tai, 60, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong who co-organized an unofficial primary election at the center of the case, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the longest of the 45 sentences and the longest since the national security law was introduced in 2020. The others ranged from four years and two months to seven years and nine months.",
      "The defendants had faced up to life imprisonment under the national security law, which Beijing imposed in response to pro-democracy demonstrations that roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019.",
      "Tai was among 47 opposition politicians, academics, activists and others charged in 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion, one of four crimes the law established. Two of the defendants were acquitted in May.",
      "They were charged in connection with their roles in an unofficial primary election held in July 2020, weeks after the national security law went into effect. The primary, which aimed to boost democrats\u2019 chances of winning a majority in an upcoming election for the Hong Kong legislature, drew more than 600,000 voters in the city of 7.5 million.",
      "Many of the candidates in the primary election had vowed to repeatedly veto the government\u2019s proposed budget to force the resignation of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s top leader at the time. High Court Judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan had said the plan could have created a constitutional crisis, and rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that it was within the bounds of Hong Kong law.",
      "If the plan had been successful, \u201cthe adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government,\u201d the judges, who were handpicked by the Hong Kong government to oversee the trial, said Tuesday in their 82-page ruling.",
      "Authorities had warned that the primary risked violating the national security law, which Hong Kong and Chinese officials say was necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the sometimes-violent protests.",
      "Critics say the law has instead driven a crackdown on expression in the former British colony, which was promised its civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years when it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. In March, Hong Kong\u2019s opposition-free legislature also enacted local national security legislation.",
      "The U.S. and other Western governments have criticized the so-called Hong Kong 47 trial as politically motivated and called for the defendants\u2019 immediate release. Most of the defendants, who are in their 20s to their 60s, have been held without bail since their arrests in early 2021.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether they would be credited with time served.",
      "Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday that the \u201charsh sentences\u201d reflected \u201cjust how fast Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties and judicial independence have nosedived\u201d since the national security law was imposed four years ago.",
      "\u201cRunning in an election and trying to win it is now a crime that can lead to a decade in prison in Hong Kong,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The Hong Kong government rejects the idea that judicial independence is under threat, saying that cases are handled in accordance with the law and that individual rights are protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution and Bill of Rights.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \u201cfirmly supports\u201d Hong Kong \u201cin safeguarding national security and lawfully punishing activities that endanger it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe resolutely oppose interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and the smearing or undermining of Hong Kong\u2019s legal system by certain Western nations under the guise of specific judicial cases,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said.",
      "Of the 47 defendants, 31 \u2014 including Tai \u2014 pleaded guilty in the hope of lesser sentencing. Fourteen others were convicted in May, while the remaining two were acquitted.",
      "Apart from Tai, three other pro-democracy politicians \u2014 Au Nok-hin, Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung \u2014 were also considered primary organizers and \u201cprincipal offenders.\u201d All three testified for the prosecution, and they received sentences of six years and one month to seven years.",
      "Others including Joshua Wong, who gained global prominence as a leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were considered \u201cactive participants\u201d and mostly received shorter sentences.",
      "A woman identified by Reuters as Elsa Wu, whose son Hendrick Lui, a 42-year-old former social worker, was sentenced to four years and three months, was taken to a security van by police after she tried to hold up a sign in support outside the court building.",
      "\u201cHe is a good person,\u201d she shouted repeatedly while in tears.\u00a0\u201cWhy does he have to go to jail? Why?\u201d",
      "John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in the city\u2019s politics and governance, said the trial was part of authorities\u2019 effort to eliminate opposition.",
      "Among the 47 are \u201csecond-tier pan-democrats\u201d who were previously active members of the Hong Kong legislature, Burns said. In the eyes of authorities, he said, the \u201csole first tier\u201d is billionaire media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the founder of now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, who is also charged under the national security law and is taking the stand for the first time Wednesday as defense arguments begin almost a year into his trial.",
      "Given that the pan-democratic opposition regularly drew support from 40% to 60% of voters before electoral reforms in 2021 restricted candidacy to \u201cpatriots only,\u201d the trial also aims to \u201cre-educate\u201d Hong Kong people about how they should act on their political beliefs rather than change the way they think about politics, Burns said.",
      "\u201cStill, we see that some people are not getting the message, apparently,\u201d he said, noting a series of recent arrests under the local national security law, known as Article 23.",
      "Despite growing influence from Beijing, more than 80% of adults in Hong Kong support a democratic system in which two or more political parties compete in elections, according to a 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center.",
      "Hundreds of people, some of them with portable chairs, lined up hours and even days in advance to secure a spot in the courtroom for the activists\u2019 sentencing. On Tuesday morning, more people gathered outside the West Kowloon Magistrates\u2019 Court amid light rain and wind.",
      "Margaret Chen, a 59-year-old retiree who said she had attended most of the trial since it began in February 2023, said she had been in line since midday Sunday with her sleeping bag and other camping gear.",
      "The trial is \u201ctoo absurd\u201d and \u201cunjust,\u201d Chen said, adding that democracy had died in Hong Kong and people are too afraid to speak out.",
      "\u201cIf the primary election is illegal, then aren\u2019t the hundreds of thousands of people who voted also breaking the law? Why haven\u2019t they prosecuted us yet?\u201d she said.",
      "Carson Tsang, 21, a law student, said the trial was a \u201chistorical moment\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s common law system.",
      "\u201cThe final result of the trial is not the most important thing,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cAs long as we have a group of people who continue to care about Hong Kong and the democrats, it\u2019s more than enough.\u201d"

      "Fifty years after the\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family killings, the name Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0still evokes a strong image \u2014 that of a shaggy-haired cult leader who spoke provocatively about mass murder.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to feel guilty. I haven\u2019t done anything I\u2019m ashamed of. Maybe I haven\u2019t done enough,\u201d\u00a0Manson said in a\u00a01987 interview with TODAY\u00a0at California\u2019s San Quentin prison. \u201cMaybe I should have killed four, five hundred people, then I would have felt better. Then I would have felt like I really offered society something.\u201d",
      "Manson, whose followers committed a series of brutal killings in the late 1960s, is known for his infamous crimes. What\u2019s less known is who\u00a0Manson\u00a0was behind the scenes, when he was not being interviewed or making erratic outbursts in the courtroom.",
      "A new Peacock docuseries, \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson,\u201d out Nov. 19, features 20 years of never-before-heard recordings of\u00a0Manson\u2019s private phone conversations from prison. Peacock is owned by TODAY\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.",
      "More than 100 hours of audio recordings were provided by John Michael Jones, a man who says he first wrote to\u00a0Manson\u00a0in an effort to get his signature, then struck up a decadeslong relationship with him,\u00a0according to his interview in the documentary.\u00a0They stayed in touch until\u00a0Manson\u2019s death in 2017.",
      "These recordings \u201cgave us a candid conversation that we\u2019ve never seen. We\u2019ve never seen\u00a0Manson\u00a0without the mask before,\u201d the documentary\u2019s director, Billie Mintz, tells\u00a0TODAY.com.",
      "Mintz says the documentary, which also features several interviews with former members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s circle, is not meant to exonerate\u00a0Manson, but to add dimension and context to the widely accepted narrative about him. The documentary also includes the perspective of a forensic psychologist who analyzes\u00a0Manson\u2019s tapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I have sympathy for\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says, \u201cbut by humanizing him, we understand a lot more of what led to these tragic events, and we learned a lot more about ourselves.\u201d",
      "Read on to learn more about Charles\u00a0Manson, and what is revealed in \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson.\u201d",
      "Who was Charles Manson?",
      "Charles\u00a0Manson\u00a0was a cult leader who was convicted in murder in 1971\u00a0after his\u00a0supporters committed a series of violent murders under his influence.",
      "Manson\u2019s followers, many of whom were teenage girls drawn to communal living and other 1960s counterculture ideals, have opened up about how he exerted power over them.",
      "\u201cHe was always needing to be in control, and that came from having all control taken from him at a very young age, and being helpless,\u201d former follower Catherine Share says in the documentary.",
      "Share was not involved in the Tate-LaBianca murders but served five years for involvement in a\u00a0Manson\u00a0Family robbery and later served a sentence for participating in a credit card scheme,\u00a0per AP.",
      "\u201cAnd a man does not want to be helpless, and he\u2019ll do anything not to feel that way again. He tried love for a while. He said, \u2018Oh, that worked.\u2019 And he said, \u2018But fear is stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0had a troubled upbringing full of trauma and abandonment, per\u00a0NBC News, and he had frequent run-ins with the law from a young age. By the time he was 32 and released from a 10-year prison term in 1967, he had spent half his life in prison, Vincent Bugliosi \u2014 a true crime author and the prosecutor at\u00a0Manson\u2019s trial for the Tate-LaBianca Murder \u2014 estimates in \u201cHelter Skelter,\u201d a definitive book about\u00a0Manson. After his release, he moved to San Francisco and began attracting members of a group he called the Family. Members of the Family would go on to commit murders at\u00a0Manson\u2019s ordering.",
      "In April 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0was convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, as well as one count of conspiracy to commit murder, for the deaths of seven people in what is often referred to as the Tate-LaBianca murders.",
      "Members of\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers killed five people during the Tate murders, which took place on Aug. 9, 1969.",
      "Actor Sharon Tate Polanski, the wife of director Roman Polanski, was one of the people killed during a gathering at her home. She had been 8 months pregnant. Also murdered were hair stylist Jay Sebring, Folger coffee heiress Abigail Folger and her boyfriend, writer Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent, who was visiting the caretaker of the Polanskis\u2019 guest house.",
      "The next day on Aug. 10,\u00a0Manson\u2019s followers murdered two more people, Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary LaBianca, at their home in Los Angeles, per the Associated Press.",
      "While\u00a0Manson\u00a0was not physically present for any of these murders, prosecutors argued he held responsibility for the killings because he had known about the planned violence and had been closely involved in directing his followers to commit murder.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution\u2019s thesis was that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was vicariously liable for the acts of all the co-indictees,\u201d according to a\u00a01976 opinion\u00a0issued in the Court of Appeals of California. \u201cIf the jury believed\u00a0Manson\u00a0to be a conspirator, aider or abettor he was culpable for all of the homicides regardless of who held the knife.\u201d",
      "Manson\u00a0spoke to his role in the murders in the documentary. \u201cI never said I was innocent. I said I didn\u2019t break the law,\u201d he said.",
      "In March 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and three of his followers, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten, were sentenced to death for their roles in the Tate-LaBianca killings,\u00a0NBC News reported in his obit. Van Houten was charged in conspiracy for all the killings but for murder only in the LaBianca killings. Tex Watson was also sentenced to death later that year, the\u00a0New York Times reported\u00a0in 1971.",
      "In December 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0received two further first-degree murder convictions for the July 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman, per\u00a0NBC News, and the August 1969 death of stuntman and actor Donald Shea, per\u00a0NBC News.",
      "Bobby Beausoleil was convicted in the killing of Hinman in 1970 and remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "In 1971,\u00a0Manson\u00a0devotee Bruce Davis was convicted in the killing of Hinman and Shea, and he remains in prison, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Steve Grogan was also convicted in Shea\u2019s killing and was released on parole in 1985 after revealing the location of Shea\u2019s body, per\u00a0the L.A. Times.",
      "The following year,\u00a0Manson\u00a0and his followers\u2019 sentences were commuted to life in prison after California abolished the death penalty in 1972.",
      "Manson\u00a0remained incarcerated for the rest of his life. He died at 83 from natural causes on Nov. 19, 2017, at a hospital in Kern County, California, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.",
      "Atkins, convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, died in prison of cancer in 2009,\u00a0NBC News reported. Watson and Krenwinkel, both convicted on seven counts of first-degree murder, remain in prison, per the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Van Houten, convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, was freed on parole in 2023,\u00a0NBC News reported.",
      "What is revealed in the Peacock documentary about\u00a0Manson?",
      "The \u201cMaking\u00a0Manson\u201d docuseries features never-before-heard audio recordings of\u00a0Manson\u00a0discussing his childhood, his followers and his criminal convictions.",
      "In one recording,\u00a0Manson\u00a0claims that he murdered multiple people in Mexico.",
      "\u201cSee, there\u2019s a whole part of my life that nobody knows about,\u201d he tells Jones in the tape. \u201cI lived in Mexico for a while. I went to Acapulco, stole some cars. I just got involved in stuff over my head, man \u2026 got involved in a couple of killings. I left my .357 Magnum in Mexico City, and I left some dead people on the beach.\u201d",
      "He also argues that he was not responsible for the murders his followers committed and accuses the media of twisting his story.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the media. The media that starts selling that. They didn\u2019t want to hear the truth. They wanted that hippie cult leader thing, man,\u201d he says in one recording. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give a f--- whether I did it or whether I didn\u2019t do it. They wanted that vicarious thrill.\u201d",
      "Jones says in the documentary that he resonated with\u00a0Manson\u2019s difficult childhood experiences and describes building up a trusting relationship with\u00a0Manson\u00a0over the years.",
      "\u201cHe found somebody he could be vulnerable to. I think that\u2019s why Charlie gave me a lot of what we have on these tapes. And I think the longer I spent getting to know him, slowly that mask began to peel off,\u201d he says.",
      "Director Billie Mintz says it\u2019s possible that\u00a0Manson\u00a0was lying at times on the tapes and attempting to manipulate Jones.",
      "\u201cI think that for sure,\u00a0Manson\u00a0wanted (Jones) to like him, and (Jones) wanted to like\u00a0Manson,\u201d Mintz says. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s manipulation, but from listening to these stories, (Manson) didn\u2019t have any reason to. He didn\u2019t want to get out of prison. He wasn\u2019t trying to exonerate himself. He literally says, \u2018I\u2019m a bad guy. I should be in prison, but I shouldn\u2019t be in prison for this.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mintz says the documentary places the tapes in context by interviewing a wide range of\u00a0Manson\u00a0experts and former followers to create \u201cdiscourse where there was no discourse before.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t say we know the truth, but maybe we give you a more nuanced, closer version of the story to the truth than you might\u2019ve had before,\u201d he says.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe documentary features interviews with multiple former members of the Family, including Dianne Lake, who was 14 when she met\u00a0Manson.\u00a0She wrote in her memoir \u201cMember of the Family\u201d\u00a0that\u00a0she did not participate in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and in fact testified against\u00a0Manson\u00a0and other members of the Family during the murder trial.",
      "Lake, who was known by the nickname \u201cSnake\u201d in the Family, describes how\u00a0Manson\u00a0allegedly treated his female followers.",
      "\u201cHe definitely used us and he definitely abused us,\u201d she says. \u201cI got hit and beat and raped, once, and I think the other girls probably did, too, but they kept it a secret.\u201d",
      "Share, another former\u00a0Manson\u00a0associate, recalls\u00a0Manson\u00a0turning \u201cabsolutely dark and electrified and menacing.\u201d",
      "The documentary also features interviews with\u00a0Manson\u2019s former cellmate and family members of the Family\u2019s victims, as well as interviews with an investigative reporter, a forensic psychologist and a former FBI special agent and criminologist.",
      "Near the end of the documentary, Jones defends his relationship with\u00a0Manson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a fanboy. I\u2019m a f------ human being with a heart who happened to befriend somebody that I didn\u2019t expect to,\u201d he says.",

      "For anyone on social media, clips and soundbites from a viral \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketch about a man named Domingo have been difficult to escape.",
      "Domingo made his debut during the Oct. 12 episode of the live comedy show. Host Ariana Grande starred alongside multiple cast members in a sketch called \u201cBridesmaid Speech,\u201d in which a group of bridesmaids sing about the bride's bachelorette trip at her wedding.",
      "The song unexpectedly details Kelsey\u2019s (Chloe Fineman) affair with a man named Domingo, which sets off the groom, Matt (Andrew Dismukes). At the end of the song, just as Kelsey explains that her mystery man is in the past, Marcello Hernandez shows up as Domingo.",
      "In a now-viral line, he sings, \u201cHey Matt, came all this way/ Had to explain, direct from Domingo/ Kelsey\u2019s a friend/ She\u2019s like my sis/ But we did hook up though.\u201d",
      "The sketch quickly reached viral fame \u2014 the original TikTok clip on \"SNL's\" page has over 100 million views. More recently, the sketch has made its way into the real world. Hernandez has made appearances\u00a0as\u00a0his famous \u201cSNL\u201d character and referenced Domingo in his stand-up.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the sketch and the enthusiastic reaction it provoked.",
      "What happens in Domingo \u2018SNL\u2019 sketches?",
      "The two Domingo sketches, so far, have taken on the same pattern.",
      "Kelsey\u2019s friends \u2014 played by cast members Ego Nwodim, Heidi Gardner, Sarah Sherman and the celebrity guest \u2014 recap an encounter Kelsey had with Domingo in the form of a pop song parody.",
      "In the first sketch, a riff off Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d the women sing about their wild bachelorette trip to Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "The off-key song details bride Kelsey\u2019s escapades with Domingo until Matt finally demands that his new wife explain who the mystery man is. Domingo then appears alongside the bridesmaids, unabashedly confessing to the affair.",
      "The sketch ends with Kelsey dancing with Domingo and her bridesmaids as she shouts to Matt (or maybe to Domingo), \u201cHope we can still be friends!\u201d",
      "After the success of the first Domingo sketch, the show brought the character back for part two during its Nov. 16 episode. The second sketch, called \u201cBabymoon,\u201d continues the Domingo saga. In it, host Charli xcx joins the previous bridesmaids to sing a song for pregnant Kelsey and husband Matt during her baby shower.",
      "Set to the tune of Chappell Roan\u2019s \u201cHot to Go!,\u201d the song recaps the friends\u2019 trip in Miami, Florida. They reveal the trip\u2019s real intention was to see Domingo, as Kelsey was having doubts as to the identity of her baby's father.",
      "The next twist? Kelsey is having twins. One twin is Matt's and the other is \u2026 Domingo\u2019s, of course.",
      "Domingo pops up with a special message to his now co-parent, Matt.",
      "\u201cHey Matt, my brother, aren\u2019t you happy?/ Direct from Domingo, we both are daddies/ Domingo going to be in your life forever/ We\u2019ll raise our babies in Miami, together!\u201d Domingo sings.",
      "Though Matt wasn\u2019t too pleased, the internet welcomed Domingo back with open arms. The clips \u201cSNL\u201d shared of the second sketch have over 40 million views so far.",
      "The world reacts to Domingo",
      "Simply put, Domingo has dominated the internet. The original clip from the sketch shared to \u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d TikTok has garnered over 102 million views, with fans using the song in their own social media videos.",
      "Released weeks before Halloween, several TikTok users uploaded their creative costumes inspired by Domingo and the sketch leading up to the holiday.",
      "Hernandez is, naturally, caught at the center of the phenomenon. When he visited Citi Field in October, the New York Mets gifted Hernandez a Mets jersey emblazoned with just one name: Domingo.",
      "In a TikTok video, Hernandez laughs as he holds up the uniform and sings, \u201cHey Mets, came all this way/ Had to say, direct from Domingo.\u201d",
      "Hernandez joked during one of his October stand-up sets that he would only do the Domingo impression once.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. We do it one time and then we put our phones down and you let me tell you the jokes that I wrote for you,\u201d Hernandez told the crowd.",
      "Sabrina Carpenter, whose song \u201cEspresso\u201d kicked off the trend, got further in on the joke when she playfully arrested Hernandez, who showed up in full Domingo costume, at her Nov. 17 show in Los Angeles.",
      "In clips shared by fans to social media, Carpenter asks Domingo if he has any last words before she puts her pink handcuffs on him.",
      "\u201cCame all this way/ Had to explain/ Direct from Domingo,\u201d Hernandez sang as the crowd went wild. \u201cSabrina\u2019s a friend/ She\u2019s like my sis/ But I would hookup though!\u201d",
      "Carpenter responded, \u201cLike, now?\u201d and handed him the handcuffs before singing hit \u201cJuno.\u201d",
      "Following the exchange, Hernandez shared a series of photos with Carpenter on social media with no caption. Dressed as Domingo, he posed with his hand on Carpenter's thigh.",
      "Another picture from the post captures the moment Hernandez sang to Carpenter in character, while another shot shows a card that reads \u201cDomingo.\"",
      "Carpenter shared her own post that included shots with Hernandez as Domingo, including a polaroid photo of them posing together and a clip from their fun banter. The post also featured an image of her holding up the pink handcuffs for Hernandez.",
      "In the caption of her post, Carpenter referenced the song from \u201cSNL,\u201d writing, \u201cLA night 2 second locationnnn maybe he\u2019s biiii!!!\u201d"

      "After Marissa Bode got the call asking her to play Nessarose in \"Wicked,\" her parents had an unexpected reaction.",
      "\"They were so happy for me for all about three minutes,\" Bode, 24, tells TODAY. \"And then they were like, 'We told you to get your passport.'\"",
      "\"Wicked\" was filmed in the United Kingdom, near London. She was offered the part in October 2022, and ideally, she would have headed to set the next day.",
      "\"Rehearsals had already started. Ethan (Slater) was already there, Ari (Grande) and Cynthia (Erivo) were already over there,\" Bode says.",
      "But there was a catch: She needed to order a passport. So after the initial excitement of getting cast wore off \u2014 a process that included leads Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo holding up a sign that read, \"Will you be our Nessarose?\" \u2014\u00a0Bode was \"terrified,\" she says.",
      "\u201cAfter everything calmed down, I was like, \u2018Hey, so, actually I don\u2019t have my passport,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so scared they were going to go with somebody else. But it worked out.\u201d",
      "After Bode got the document expedited, delaying her trip across the pond to film by only a few weeks, she came onto the set feeling \"nervous and anxious.\"",
      "\"When I care about something so much like this, I want to put my all into it, and I want to remind them why they chose me,\" she says.",
      "The Universal Pictures production marks Bode's film debut. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "The Wisconsin native grew up performing in plays through middle school and high school and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles to study acting.",
      "Before she landed the part in \"Wicked,\" Bode was working as an after-school art teacher and mentor. When the audition for Nessarose landed in her inbox, she put her all into it.",
      "She says she feels \"beyond privileged and lucky\" to have been cast in \"Wicked\" just one year after graduating college.",
      "\"When you're not represented a lot and you don't see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, 'I know what I'm capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,'\" she says. \"But how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\"",
      "Now, she's making history as the first actor who uses a wheelchair to portray Nessarose, Elphaba's sister, in \"Wicked\" throughout its more than 21-year run.",
      "Making Nessarose her own",
      "In \u201cWicked,\u201d Nessarose is the younger sister of the green witch Elphaba, who eventually becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "In the story, Nessarose uses a wheelchair due to complications from her birth, attributable to her mother eating milk flowers while pregnant to avoid having another green baby.",
      "Much of Nessarose\u2019s arc involves her asserting her independence \u2014 something Bode, who started using a wheelchair at age 11 after a car accident, can relate to. After the accident, she remembers having her parents come on class trips with her for \u201cliability purposes,\u201d a phrase she puts in quotes.",
      "\u201cI see all my other classmates be completely independent, and that was hard for me, because all I wanted was to have that independence,\u201d she says.",
      "Bode\u2019s own upbringing allowed her to empathize with Nessarose, especially her situation at the beginning of the film. In \u201cWicked,\u201d Nessarose is excited to start school at Shiz University on her own, away from her father and sister. But the sisters' father asks Elphaba to keep an eye on Nessarose, which eventually leads to Elphaba enrolling at Shiz, too.",
      "\u201cAlthough you love your family, you really do want to be on your own and to prove to yourself that you can, even though you already know that you can,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Elphaba\u2019s journey to attending Shiz University in \u201cWicked\u201d the movie is slightly different from the musical\u2019s storyline. Originally, Elphaba is enrolled at Shiz from the beginning under her father\u2019s orders to look after her sister. But in the 2024 film, the plan is for Elphaba to only be there while Nessarose gets settled in.",
      "\u201cOf course, all disabilities are different, and there are some people in wheelchairs that have a higher level of needs and higher level of caregiving. But I think this was a moment to showcase that I don\u2019t have to be dependent on somebody,\u201d Bode says.",
      "In the musical, Nessarose and Elphaba\u2019s relationship is complicated, in part, by Nessarose\u2019s resentment of Elphaba\u2019s powers, her ability to walk and the amount of attention she receives.",
      "By splitting the movies in two, \u201cWicked\u201d can slow down and explore a sweeter side to their relationship.",
      "\u201cThere were pockets of time within the film itself when Elphaba is there where I am enjoying her presence because she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Bode says of her character.",
      "Another small difference that can be seen as a big change in Nessarose\u2019s storyline is how she tells Elphaba about the invitation she receives to the Ozdust Ballroom during the sweeping mid-film number \u201cDancing Through Life.\u201d",
      "Nessarose is able to \u201cconfide in her sister about wanting to go to this dance and have that be more of a special moment for them,\u201d Bode says, \u201crather than really anxiously begging the whole time, \u2018Please, just me.\u2019\u201d",
      "Making history in and out of Oz",
      "As the first-ever physically disabled actor to play Ness, Bode brings direct experience to the character.",
      "\u201cHow I feel as a disabled person in a world that is not necessarily built for me, in a world where people just don\u2019t understand or aren\u2019t always fully educated on disability as a whole \u2014 I definitely took those with me and leaned that into my character,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Bode says she feels \u201cover the moon\u201d about the decision to cast a wheelchair user as Nessarose in the \u201cWicked\u201d film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Bode credits some of the \u201clittle things\u201d she brought to the character of Nessarose with making her performance feel authentic. For example \u2014 where and how Nessarose transported her bag.",
      "\u201cI made the adjustment of having it on the back of my chair,\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose is also able to independently make her way around campus in the movie. \u201cThankfully, the University of Shiz is accessible,\u201d Bode says. \u201cThere are ramps everywhere.\u201d",
      "And that alone sends a message, Bode says.",
      "\u201cThere are still a number of campuses \u2014 I know because I have a number of disabled friends still going to college and even my partner who\u2019s in college \u2014 that aren\u2019t accessible,\u201d Bode says. \u201cI think that also sends a message to universities and just people as a whole as to why and how they should make their spaces more accessible.\u201d",
      "She hopes her character can help people \u201cfeel a lot less alone,\u201d especially if they haven\u2019t found their community yet.",
      "But representation is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg,\u201d she notes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much more when it comes to fighting for accessibility and inclusion,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hope feeling less alone helps other disabled people and emboldens them to advocate for themselves and for others in the community.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for his country's use of nuclear weapons Tuesday, days after the United States allowed Ukraine to strike inside Russia using American missiles.",
      "The Kremlin announced that Putin had approved an updated nuclear doctrine \u2014 a document that governs how Russia uses its nuclear arsenal \u2014 including the declaration that Moscow could unleash a nuclear strike if subject to an attack by a nonnuclear country that has the support of a nuclear state.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said later Tuesday that Ukraine had carried out its first strike on Russian territory using U.S.-supplied long-range weapons, hitting a military facility in the Bryansk region with an ATACMS missile.",
      "Russian air defenses shot down five ATACMS missiles but fragments of another \u201cfell on the technical territory of a military facility in the Bryansk region, causing a fire that was quickly extinguished. There were no casualties or damage,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "\"According to confirmed data, the deployed ATACMS operational-tactical missiles were American-made,\" it said.",
      "Two U.S. officials later confirmed to NBC News that Ukraine had fired ATACMS near the city of Karachev in the Bryansk region, across the country's northern border, marking the first use of the U.S-supplied weapons inside Russia.",
      "Although Ukraine has struck targets deep inside Russia already, they  it has used homemade drones and not Western missiles with the fire power of the ATACMs, they said.",
      "Ukraine's military said that it had hit a military arsenal near the city of Karachev in Bryansk. It did not specify what weapons were used in the attack.",
      "The changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine mark the most significant saber-rattling yet by the Kremlin, which has consistently warned about possible nuclear war throughout the now 1,000 days since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear doctrine update was required to bring the document in line with the current political situation,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the TASS state news agency in comments published early Tuesday.",
      "Peskov outlined Moscow\u2019s new threat in light of Washington\u2019s shift in policy: that the use of Western nonnuclear missiles by Ukraine\u2019s military against Russia under the new doctrine could lead to a nuclear response.",
      "Still, the use of nuclear weapons would be a \u201clast resort measure,\u201d he added.",
      "Putin had signaled the update to his country\u2019s policy earlier this year as he sought to warn the West against loosening restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia.",
      "Russia also reserved the rise to use the weapons even if Belarus was attacked, he said then. And the new doctrine matches that shift.",
      "\"Aggression against the Russian Federation and its allies by a non-nuclear country with the support of a nuclear state will be considered a joint attack,\" it reads.",
      "The doctrine also says that \u201cThe Russian Federation may use nuclear weapons in the event of a critical threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of itself and Belarus,\u201d a shift from previous language that said it may use nuclear weapons \u201cwhen the very existence of the state is at risk.\u201d",
      "The changes follow Putin's warning to the U.S. and its NATO allies that any use of their long-range weapons supplied to Ukraine against Russian territory would mean NATO and Russia are at war.",
      "The Biden administration had long resisted Kyiv's calls to relax restrictions on the weapons it has supplied to its ally.",
      "But after the U.S. and others said that thousands of North Korean troops had joined the fight alongside the Kremlin's military, U.S. officials told NBC News that the Biden administration had authorized use of the long-range ATACMS missile systems for limited strikes inside Russia.",
      "The shift drew condemnation from the Kremlin, with Peskov saying Monday that Washington was pouring \"oil on the fire\" and was provoking \"further escalation of tension around this conflict.\"",

      "He was also charged with one count of \"abuse in close relationships,\" violating a restraining order, and driving without a valid driver\u2019s license, police said Tuesday.",
      "A preliminary charge comes before a formal charge, and allows law enforcement to detain a suspect for further investigation.",
      "They add to the growing list of charges against the Oslo socialite, the eldest child of Norwegian Crown Princess Mette-Marit from a relationship prior to her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon.",
      "He is currently being held by police in Oslo.",

      "According to police, when he was arrested Monday Borg Hoiby was in a car with the alleged victim from the August incident.",
      "Borg Hoiby apologized for the events leading up to his August arrest in a statement to NRK at the time, blaming it on \"being intoxicated with alcohol and cocaine after an argument\" and \"several mental illnesses\" for which he planned to \"resume treatment.\"",
      "He was four when his mother married Prince Haakon in 2001, and despite not being an official member of the royal family, has attended events and lived on royal property with his mother, stepfather and two half-siblings, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus.",
      "During the royal couple's engagement, Mette-Marit was criticized in the media as an inappropriate choice for future queen due to having had a child with a man convicted of drug possession, and her own \"wild past\" involving rumored partying and drug-taking.",
      "Mette-Marit responded with a televised news conference the week before the 2001 wedding, in which she condemned drugs and apologized for having \"lived a dissolute life\" before meeting the prince, and was ultimately praised by the media for her \"Cinderella\" story.",
      "Borg Hoiby has previously been in the spotlight for selling designer items on a Norwegian reselling app and listing the address as the royal palace. He played a walk-on role on a popular Norwegian teenage television show, and even appeared in an American Vogue feature in 2018 giving tips on the most stylish spots to spend time in Oslo.",

      "Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,800 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their toll. The war has left much of the territory in ruins and forced around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million to flee, often multiple times."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "A senior U.S. official attributed the mix-up in Rio de Janeiro to logistical challenges.",
      "\u201cDue to logistical issues, they took the family photo early before all the leaders had arrived. So a number of leaders weren\u2019t actually there when they took the photo,\u201d said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Biden was nowhere to be found until just after the photo was taken, when photographers and reporters began searching frantically for him.",
      "One cameraman spotted him behind a nearby palm tree alongside Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau and Italian premier Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Trudeau and Meloni also missed the photo.",
      "When asked whether Biden intentionally skipped the photo to avoid standing near Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the official dismissed the idea, stating, \u201cIt was just simply logistical issues.\u201d",
      "During the first session of the summit Sunday, Biden reflected on his impending departure from the White House.",

      "On Monday, a senior aide acknowledged that many nations were already anticipating the very different global leadership of President-elect Donald Trump, but emphasized that Biden remains fully in charge.",
      "\u201cWe have a system, fundamentally, that\u2019s predicated on one president at a time,\u201d said Jon Finer, deputy national security adviser. \u201cPresident Biden is that president, he will be handing off power in January, and it will be up to a new administration to decide what to do with it.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Biden himself acknowledged the limited time left in office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m leaving office in January,\u201d he said. \u201cI will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.\u201d",

      "The member countries represent around 85% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, more than 75% of world trade and around two-thirds of the world\u2019s population, according to the forum.",
      "The G20 was established in 1999 in response to the Asian financial crisis, initially serving as a forum for finance ministers and central bank officials to discuss economic stability.",
      "It has since evolved into a high-level meeting of heads of state and government."

      "While the bill lacks enough support to pass, critics see in it a desire to reverse decades of policies that aimed to empower Maori, who make up around 20% of the 5.3 million population but have higher levels of deprivation and incarceration and worse health outcomes than the broader population.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 A Hong Kong court sentenced dozens of leading pro-democracy figures to up to 10 years in prison Tuesday in the single largest trial under a national security law that critics say has been used to all but eliminate political dissent in the Chinese territory.",
      "Benny Tai, 60, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong who co-organized an unofficial primary election at the center of the case, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, the longest of the 45 sentences and the longest since the national security law was introduced in 2020. The others ranged from four years and two months to seven years and nine months.",
      "The defendants had faced up to life imprisonment under the national security law, which Beijing imposed in response to pro-democracy demonstrations that roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019.",
      "Tai was among 47 opposition politicians, academics, activists and others charged in 2021 with conspiracy to commit subversion, one of four crimes the law established. Two of the defendants were acquitted in May.",
      "They were charged in connection with their roles in an unofficial primary election held in July 2020, weeks after the national security law went into effect. The primary, which aimed to boost democrats\u2019 chances of winning a majority in an upcoming election for the Hong Kong legislature, drew more than 600,000 voters in the city of 7.5 million.",
      "Many of the candidates in the primary election had vowed to repeatedly veto the government\u2019s proposed budget to force the resignation of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s top leader at the time. High Court Judges Andrew Chan, Alex Lee and Johnny Chan had said the plan could have created a constitutional crisis, and rejected the defendants\u2019 argument that it was within the bounds of Hong Kong law.",
      "If the plan had been successful, \u201cthe adverse consequences would be far reaching and no less serious than overthrowing the government,\u201d the judges, who were handpicked by the Hong Kong government to oversee the trial, said Tuesday in their 82-page ruling.",
      "Authorities had warned that the primary risked violating the national security law, which Hong Kong and Chinese officials say was necessary to restore stability in the international financial hub after the sometimes-violent protests.",
      "Critics say the law has instead driven a crackdown on expression in the former British colony, which was promised its civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years when it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. In March, Hong Kong\u2019s opposition-free legislature also enacted local national security legislation.",
      "The U.S. and other Western governments have criticized the so-called Hong Kong 47 trial as politically motivated and called for the defendants\u2019 immediate release. Most of the defendants, who are in their 20s to their 60s, have been held without bail since their arrests in early 2021.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether they would be credited with time served.",
      "Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday that the \u201charsh sentences\u201d reflected \u201cjust how fast Hong Kong\u2019s civil liberties and judicial independence have nosedived\u201d since the national security law was imposed four years ago.",
      "\u201cRunning in an election and trying to win it is now a crime that can lead to a decade in prison in Hong Kong,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The Hong Kong government rejects the idea that judicial independence is under threat, saying that cases are handled in accordance with the law and that individual rights are protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution and Bill of Rights.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \u201cfirmly supports\u201d Hong Kong \u201cin safeguarding national security and lawfully punishing activities that endanger it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe resolutely oppose interference in China\u2019s internal affairs and the smearing or undermining of Hong Kong\u2019s legal system by certain Western nations under the guise of specific judicial cases,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said.",
      "Of the 47 defendants, 31 \u2014 including Tai \u2014 pleaded guilty in the hope of lesser sentencing. Fourteen others were convicted in May, while the remaining two were acquitted.",
      "Apart from Tai, three other pro-democracy politicians \u2014 Au Nok-hin, Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung \u2014 were also considered primary organizers and \u201cprincipal offenders.\u201d All three testified for the prosecution, and they received sentences of six years and one month to seven years.",
      "Others including Joshua Wong, who gained global prominence as a leader of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were considered \u201cactive participants\u201d and mostly received shorter sentences.",
      "A woman identified by Reuters as Elsa Wu, whose son Hendrick Lui, a 42-year-old former social worker, was sentenced to four years and three months, was taken to a security van by police after she tried to hold up a sign in support outside the court building.",
      "\u201cHe is a good person,\u201d she shouted repeatedly while in tears.\u00a0\u201cWhy does he have to go to jail? Why?\u201d",
      "John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in the city\u2019s politics and governance, said the trial was part of authorities\u2019 effort to eliminate opposition.",
      "Among the 47 are \u201csecond-tier pan-democrats\u201d who were previously active members of the Hong Kong legislature, Burns said. In the eyes of authorities, he said, the \u201csole first tier\u201d is billionaire media tycoon Jimmy Lai, the founder of now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, who is also charged under the national security law and is taking the stand for the first time Wednesday as defense arguments begin almost a year into his trial.",
      "Given that the pan-democratic opposition regularly drew support from 40% to 60% of voters before electoral reforms in 2021 restricted candidacy to \u201cpatriots only,\u201d the trial also aims to \u201cre-educate\u201d Hong Kong people about how they should act on their political beliefs rather than change the way they think about politics, Burns said.",
      "\u201cStill, we see that some people are not getting the message, apparently,\u201d he said, noting a series of recent arrests under the local national security law, known as Article 23.",
      "Despite growing influence from Beijing, more than 80% of adults in Hong Kong support a democratic system in which two or more political parties compete in elections, according to a 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center.",
      "Hundreds of people, some of them with portable chairs, lined up hours and even days in advance to secure a spot in the courtroom for the activists\u2019 sentencing. On Tuesday morning, more people gathered outside the West Kowloon Magistrates\u2019 Court amid light rain and wind.",
      "Margaret Chen, a 59-year-old retiree who said she had attended most of the trial since it began in February 2023, said she had been in line since midday Sunday with her sleeping bag and other camping gear.",
      "The trial is \u201ctoo absurd\u201d and \u201cunjust,\u201d Chen said, adding that democracy had died in Hong Kong and people are too afraid to speak out.",

      "Carson Tsang, 21, a law student, said the trial was a \u201chistorical moment\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s common law system.",
      "\u201cThe final result of the trial is not the most important thing,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cAs long as we have a group of people who continue to care about Hong Kong and the democrats, it\u2019s more than enough.\u201d"

      "Investigators in Russia are looking into the death of Vladimir Shklyarov, a principal dancer at the world-famous Mariinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, after he fell from an apartment block balcony and died at the age of 39.",
      "Police in St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s second city, say initial information suggests his fall, which was discovered early on Saturday morning, was the result of an accident, state media have reported.",
      "The Mariinsky said in a statement on Monday it would host a farewell ceremony for him on Thursday ahead of his funeral later that day and that members of the public were welcome to pay their respects to someone who was widely respected for his flair in executing the classical Russian ballet repertoire.",
      "\u201cHe has forever inscribed his name in the history of world ballet,\u201d the Mariinsky said, noting he had been the recipient in 2020 of a top state award for his artistry and taken leading roles in numerous productions.",
      "Shklyarov was famous outside Russia too, having danced at the Royal Ballet in London and at the Bavarian State Ballet in Munich.",
      "Irina Bartnovskaya, who runs a Telegram channel focused on ballet called \u201cThe Devil in Ballet Shoes,\u201d was one of the first to publicize the death \u2014 part of which was captured on CCTV \u2014 on Saturday morning.",
      "\u201cVolodya (Vladimir) was resting up at home, on painkillers and preparing for an... operation,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHe went out onto the balcony to get some air and smoke, lost his balance (it\u2019s a very narrow balcony) and fell (from the fifth floor). It was a stupid unbearable accident.\"",
      "\u201cHe loved life, his family, and adored his children and his audience.\u201d",
      "Shklyarov was variously reported to be suffering from severe back, foot and hip pain.",
      "The father of two young children was reportedly divorced from his ballerina wife Maria Shirinkina, a first soloist at the Mariinsky."

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:16:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Ukrainians welcomed the U.S. move to let it strike in Kursk with ATACMS, as a wave of deadly Russian attacks on Sumy and Odesa caused power cuts.",
    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian capital was blanketed by darkness Monday, even as residents were bolstered by a sense that their American allies had \u2014 finally \u2014 seen the light.",
      "President Joe Biden has authorized Kyiv to use U.S. weapons for strikes deep inside Russia, according to two U.S. officials \u2014 a major policy shift that drew a furious response from the Kremlin on Monday, accusing the administration of pouring \"oil on the fire\" two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Crucially for Ukraine, the decision comes after months of pleading and just as Russia has intensified a wave of aerial attacks that forced widespread blackouts and killed more than a dozen people, according to local officials.",
      "\"It is excellent news for us and a significant move,\" Kyiv resident  Maryna Vlasenko, 39, told NBC News.",
      "She also bemoaned the lengthy process and the continued limits on Ukraine's use of the long-range weapons, however. \u201cSometimes I just have a feeling that we are receiving the bare minimum in order not to die, and with such an attitude, Ukraine will bleed to death,\u201d  Vlasenko said in an interview Monday.",
      "\u201cBut it is better to have such a decision now than not having it at all.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has for months rebuffed Kyiv's pleas to lift the restrictions on its usage of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in the Kursk border region of Russia. But with Kim Jong Un sending thousands of North Korean troops to help the Kremlin's forces retake land there occupied by Ukraine, the U.S. ally will now be able to use the weapons in and around Kursk.",
      "Moscow is not just pressing on the battlefield.",
      "It has also ramped up its aerial assault against its neighbor with days of widespread attacks hitting civilian targets and critical infrastructure ahead of winter.",
      "At least 11 people, including two children, were killed in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday, local officials said. And 10 people were killed in the historic southern city of Odesa, local officials said Monday.",
      "Dozens more people were reported injured in the missile and drone strikes, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \u201cone of the largest and most dangerous\u201d attacks of the entire war. They also hammered Ukraine\u2019s power grid, leading the state operator to announce rolling power cuts in areas across the country on the eve of the 1,000th day since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "\"The week was just awful and terrifying,\" Vlasenko said in Kyiv. \"I don\u2019t have tears to cry any more, it is pure pain. I am afraid we will stay with no electricity and water again this winter. We are exhausted.\"",
      "A battlefield boost?",
      "While the White House has not publicly confirmed the reversal, the Kremlin said that if true it would amount to a \u201cnew leap of tension and a qualitatively new situation with regard to the U.S. involvement in this conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have talked about this, to continue to pour oil on the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tension around this conflict,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday.",
      "Russian media also blasted the move, with government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta saying Sunday that Biden had taken \u201cone of the most provocative, ill-considered decisions\" of his time in office,  \"which risks catastrophic consequences.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee for national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz,  also appeared to raise concerns. In an interview Monday morning on \"Fox & Friends,\" the Florida congressman said: \u201cIt\u2019s another step up the escalation ladder. And nobody knows where this is going.\u201d",
      "Despite the warnings and protestations, however, analysts said it was unlikely that the U.S. decision would either provoke major escalation from the Kremlin or do significant damage to the Russian military's positions on the front lines, which have broadly been improving with each passing day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too little and too late,\u201d said Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to bomb Ukrainians into the dark ages,\u201d he said in an interview from Kyiv. \u201cHow much worse could it get now?\u201d",
      "Frank Ledwidge, a former British military intelligence officer, agreed.",
      "\u201cIt is unlikely that a few dozen of these flung into some tactical positions are going to tip anything,\u201d said Ledwidge, a senior lecturer in war studies at England\u2019s University of Portsmouth. \u201cThis is sort of a last hurrah from the Biden administration, perhaps even a vindictive one.\u201d",
      "Still, Ukrainians largely welcomed the news of a freer rein to make the most of U.S. help \u2014 especially given Trump's impending return and the doubts in Kyiv about his commitment to backing their fight.",
      "\u201cIt's better late than never,\u201d said Vladyslav Faraponov, head of the Institute of American Studies, a nongovernmental organization in Kyiv.\u00a0\"The decision is definitely overdue. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine won\u2019t make the best of it,\" he said.",
      "\"There are still more than two months before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration,\" Faraponov said. \u201cUkrainians don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting while Russia continues killing civilians in Mykolaiv, Sumy, and pushing on the eastern front,\u201d he added.",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv, and Mithil Aggarwal from Hong Kong."
