      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Monday seeking $10 billion in damages from the BBC, accusing the British broadcaster of defamation as well as deceptive and unfair trade practices.",
      "The 33-page lawsuit accuses the BBC of broadcasting a \u201cfalse, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump,\u201d calling it \u201ca brazen attempt to interfere in and influence\u201d the 2024 U.S. presidential election.",
      "It accused the BBC of \u201csplicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump\u2019s speech on January 6, 2021\u201d in order to \u201dintentionally misrepresent the meaning of what President Trump said.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in a Florida court, seeks $5 billion in damages for defamation and $5 billion for unfair trade practices.",
      "The BBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.",
      "The broadcaster apologized last month to Trump over the edit of the Jan. 6 speech. But the publicly funded BBC rejected claims it had defamed him, after Trump threatened legal action.",
      "BBC chairman Samir Shah had called it an \u201cerror of judgment,\u201d which triggered the resignations of the BBC\u2019s top executive and its head of news.",
      "The speech took place before some of Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The BBC had broadcast the hourlong documentary \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",

    "story": [
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material. Running time: 195 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Summer's smooth blend of R&B, soul, pop, funk, rock, disco and electronica launched numerous chart-topping hits in the \u201870s and \u201980s as well as three multiplatinum albums. She won five Grammys. She was unstoppable \u2014 both as a performer and a writer.",

In recent years, there\u2019s been an explosion of films and television made from a confessional perspective that evangelize or portray a particular faith, often Christianity, that have performed particularly well with audiences.",
      "There are animated biblical films from Angel, like the upcoming musical \u201cDavid,\u201d which the company said has already exceeded $14 million in theatrical pre-sale tickets ahead of its release this Friday, to docudramas like Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Saints.\u201d While episodes from Season 2 are still being released, the first season of the Fox Nation series, which premiered last year, was the most watched on the platform.",

Earlier this year, Amazon premiered the first season of its own biblical drama, \u201cHouse of David,\u201d and gained exclusive U.S. streaming rights to \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d a massively popular drama series about the life of Jesus.",

      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

Bak believes Williams was influenced by commercial considerations and by more personal forces.",
      "Horror stories were popular on radio in the late '30s, Bak says. Williams first thought of radio plays as an \u201cexercise,\u201d but he would eventually take them more seriously. While writing \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d he was already haunted by the mental health struggles of his sister, Rose, who would later inspire the fragile Laura Wingfield of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Williams would long explore the idea of madness, Bak says, and how we respond to people who seem to see things \u201cno one else can see.\u201d",

      "New York Jets defensive tackle Jowon Briggs surprised his teammates earlier this season by singing a song during a special teams meeting",
      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Jowon Briggs was sitting in a New York Jets special teams meeting earlier this season when Chris Banjo turned to him and made a request.",
      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York. He has 28 total tackles, six tackles for loss, a forced fumble, three sacks and nine quarterback hits.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",
      "Briggs grew up in Cincinnati with four older sisters, a younger brother and parents who all loved music and sports, making for a seamless duet of life-long passions.",
      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",
      "There were times one sibling would start playing an instrument, another would join, someone would start singing and then another would harmonize.",
      "\u201cWe had a very loud house,\u201d a smiling Briggs said. \u201cIt was kind of like \u2018Battle of the Bands.\u2019 It was a lot of fun. My sisters all sing better than I can, but if you grow up in that kind of competitive household, you find out if you can sing or not fairly quickly. So I was able to figure out that I was decent.\u201d",
      "And he was pretty good at making music, too.",

      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",

      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",

      "Alex Warren's song \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025",
      "New York -- It jolted the winter, came alive in the spring, dominated the summer and went three-times platinum in the fall. Alex Warren's bombastic ballad \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025. It's also an unusual hit: slower than a traditional song of the summer, full of gloss, an ascendent hook and inoffensive, religious-adjacent lyricism.",
      "For those reasons, \u201cOrdinary\u201d has fast-tracked the 25-year-old singer/songwriter into mainstream musical fame, coming to a head in November when he earned his first Grammy nomination. The nomination for best new artist arrived just four months after the release of his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI bawled in my wife's arms,\u201d he said of the moment he found out about the nomination. For those who didn't believe in his music career, he says, \u201cthe biggest justification ever was the nomination.\u201d",
      "Most know Warren for \u201cOrdinary,\u201d but fame is not new for him. Before the chart-topping hit, Warren made a name for himself as a social media prankster in the TikTok collective \u201cHype House.\u201d And while that past might seem at odds with his new public persona, Warren always exuded perspicacity, the result of a troubled childhood that separated him from his comedic cohort. His father died of cancer when he was 9, he says, and his mother of complications due to alcoholism. A period of homelessness followed in his teens, before the TikTok fame.",
      "Still, he's remained curious and playful. At The Associated Press headquarters in New York, he chatted with staff and made disarming, self-deprecating comments. An example: In preparation to see the singer Shawn Mendes later, he dosed himself in cologne. \u201cI need to smell as good as Shawn Mendes looks,\u201d he joked.",
      "Social media success doesn't always yield a creative career \u2014 consider Warren and the innovative Addison Rae, a fellow best new artist nominee, exceptions to the rule \u2014 but it did prime him for the life he leads now. \u201cEverything that I went through back then definitely allowed me to do this,\u201d he says.",
      "Growing up online \u2014 and having \u201cdifferent versions\u201d of himself presented on social media \u2014 has \u201cdefinitely allowed me to now be unequivocally myself,\u201d he says.",
      "Warren wrote \u201cOrdinary\u201d a year ago at a writing camp. He says he knew there was something special about the track \u2014 though he and his collaborators were mostly alone in that feeling. \u201cA lot of people were like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a ballad, it\u2019s a love song ballad. That\u2019s not a single, that\u2019s a song on the album. That\u2019s a feature, you should give it to someone else,\u2019\u201d he recalls. But he pushed it on TikTok, and soon, it connected.",
      "\u201cThe TikToks got it to do 4 million streams in a day, which was crazy,\u201d he said. Then he performed it on Netflix's \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d He played it with Ed Sheeran,Jelly Roll, Luke Combs and the Jonas Brothers. It built to ubiquity.",

      "That spirit carries throughout his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d Warren returns to the record often and learns more about himself with each listen. \u201cTo me, these songs are just real, and I hope that people listen to this record and learn something about themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest thing. That was for me. It was me finding out who I was, and who I wanted to be as a husband, as a friend, as a father, and that\u2019s kind of what I got out of it.

      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",

    "summary": "Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s 2025 word of the year is &ldquo;slop.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s 2025 word of the year is \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "The viral term exploded in popularity over the summer. It\u2019s an inside joke with an unclear meaning, driven by social media. It can be traced back to rapper Skrilla\u2019s 2024 song \u201cDoot Doot (6 7).\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's self-referential,\" Barlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the rage, but it\u2019s not a defining term.\u201d",
      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwith a key\u201d \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Some learned the meaning from the titular film in 2024. Others found out in real time when Pope Leo XIV became history\u2019s first American pope in May 2025. \u201cIt was so event specific, but the spike (in searches) was huge,\" Barlow said.",
      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake\u2019s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- When actor Amy Baik was cast in a South Korean commercial last year, she thought she had landed a promising gig.",
      "But after filming wrapped, she was shocked to learn that both the director and advertiser had cut her scenes \u2014 not because of her performance, but because she lacked a facial feature prized in South Korean beauty standards.",
      "\u201cThe reason was that I don\u2019t have double eyelids,\u201d said Baik, 26.",
      "\u201cAfter receiving that feedback, I started to reconsider what kind of appearance Korea wants,\" she said, adding it \"made me wonder how I can survive as an actor in South Korea.\u201d",
      "That experience pushed her toward a different market. The global success of \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cMinari\u201d and \u201cSquid Game\u201d has opened doors for South Korean performers in Hollywood \u2014 and spawned a cottage industry of consultants helping actors navigate American casting.",
      "\u201cHollywood\u2019s the dream (...) the ultimate pinnacle of acting accolades,\u201d said Julia Kim, a Korean American casting director who worked on \u201cMinari,\u201d Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cButterfly\u201d and \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "While established stars like Park Hae-soo and Lee Byung-hun have both South Korean and American representation, most aspiring Korean actors lack such connections. That gap is what talent agencies like Los Angeles-based Upstage Entertainment are trying to bridge.",
      "Alison Dumbell, a co-founder of Upstage with experience in Bollywood and Los Angeles, said she has noticed more demands for \u201ccharacters that are specifically Korean\u201d than generic \u201cEast Asian\u201d ones from Western producers. She attributes that shift partly to the global popularity of South Korean entertainment.",
      "Still, stereotypes persist. \u201cThe one that irritates me is the nerdy tech programmer,\" Dumbell said. \u201cSometimes I just won\u2019t even submit my actor for that because I know that they\u2019re much more nuanced as actors.\u201d",
      "For most South Korean actors without connections or know-how, Hollywood is still uncharted territory.",
      "Kim, who typically casts high-profile stars and works with local casting directors for co-productions, also finds actors via social media. \u201cI usually put out an open call on my Instagram,\u201d she said.",
      "But for actors without major agency backing, the right contacts are hard to find. The American and Korean industries operate differently, and U.S. casting information rarely reaches those outside established networks.",
      "Kim said South Korean talent faces a steep learning curve. \u201cI would get questions \u2014 should I change my Korean name to a Western name? Do I pay to get an agent? Can I look into the camera when I\u2019m doing an audition?\u201d she said. Even name consistency is an issue: Kim recalled a K-pop artist turned actor whose name appeared five different ways online.",
      "Technical standards also differ. Actor Misun Youm noted American audition tapes require clean white backgrounds, while \u201cin Korea, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "Headshots diverge too: South Korean profiles feature modellike images, while American headshots match character types.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, you shoot profile photos like a fashion magazine model,\u201d said veteran actor Shin Ju-hwan, who goes by Julian Shin. He played a masked soldier in second and third seasons of \u201cSquid Game,\" and stars in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d Season 3.",

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",
      "There are boys like Arfan all over the camps, selling food they\u2019re desperate to eat and collecting trash in exchange for cash, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, skin seared by the sun.",
      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",

      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",

The request would then have to be approved by the person\u2019s attending physician as well as a consulting physician.",
      "The governor said the bill's sponsors and legislative leaders have agreed to add provisions to require confirmation from a medical doctor that the person \u201ctruly had less than six months to live,\u201d along with confirmation from a psychologist or psychiatrist that the patient is capable of making the decision and is not under duress.",

      "Susan Monarez was fired as the CDC\u2019s director and Dr. Debra Houry resigned as the agency\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director over disputes about changes at the agency. The two will work with California's public health department to help build trust in \u201cscience-driven decision-making,\u201d Newsom's office said.",

      "California has increasingly positioned itself as a counterweight to federal health policy, and Newsom has amped up his criticisms of President Donald Trump and challenged the Republican's policies in court. The governor's final term ends in just over a year, and he's gearing up for a possible presidential run in 2028.",

The CDC website was changed last month to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. A federal vaccine advisory panel voted earlier this month to reverse decades-old guidance recommending that all U.S. babies get immunized against the liver infection hepatitis B on the day they're born. The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- In a maternity ward in eastern Congo, Irene Nabudeba rested her hands on her bulging midsection, worried about giving birth in a city under rebel control.",
      "The conflict that flared this year has left many medical supplies stranded beyond the front line. Infrastructure like running water has collapsed, along with the economy in Goma, the region's humanitarian and commercial hub.",
      "And now the one glimmer of hope for mothers \u2014 a free maternity care program offered by Congo's government \u2014 has ended after it was not renewed in June. It was not clear why, and Congolese officials did not respond to questions.",

      "Several women told The Associated Press they cannot afford maternal care after Congo's program that was aimed at reducing some of the world's highest maternal and neonatal death rates ended earlier this year. The program launched in 2023 offered free consultations and treatment for illnesses and at-risk pregnancies at selected health facilities across the country.",
      "Congo ranked second in maternal deaths globally with 19,000 in 2023, behind Nigeria's 75,000 deaths, according to U.N. statistics.",

      "Clinics and hospitals were already struggling after the M23 rebels, backed by neighboring Rwanda, seized Goma in an escalation of fighting in January.",
      "Although clashes subsided amid U.S.- and Qatar-led peace efforts, fighting escalated again in recent days and the conflict has collapsed public institutions, disrupted essential services and displaced more than 700,000 people, according to the U.N. humanitarian office.",
      "In Goma, the armed rebels are seen everywhere, making a pregnant woman's walk to clinics another source of anxiety.",
      "Freddy Kaniki, deputy coordinator of M23, asserted to the AP that the free maternal care \u201cwas not renewed because it was a failure,\u201d without elaborating. Congolese officials did not respond to questions.",
      "Rwanda denies supporting the M23 despite U.N. experts saying they have evidence of it. Rwanda prides itself on health care and recently signed a five-year deal with the U.S. for investment of up to $158 million in its own health care sector.",
      "The collapse of essential services in rebel-held areas, combined with mass displacement and insecurity, has left civilians struggling to access even basic care.",
      "An International Committee of the Red Cross assessment in September found that at least 85% of health facilities were experiencing medicine shortages, and nearly 40% have seen an exodus of staff after the conflict surged in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu.",
      "The ICRC in October said 200 health facilities in eastern Congo had run out of medicines because of looting and supply disruptions. Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, has reported hospitals attacked, ambulances blocked and medical staff threatened or killed.",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",
      "Setting polite boundaries with guests who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products is also a good idea, she said.",

The United States, long its strongest ally, has chipped away at the European Union's unity, economies, security and even its democracies, setting the backdrop for an EU summit this week at the end of an exceptionally trying year.",

Ukraine is in dire financial straits, and they have promised to meet Kyiv's economic and military needs for the next two years, most probably through a new reparations loan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time for Europe and Ukraine,\u201d warned Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency. \"We need to take this decision in order to secure the Ukrainian economy, but also in order to send a signal to the rest of the world, which will include the White House in (Washington) D.C., that Europe is a strong geopolitical player.\u201d",

      "Since January, as the leaders have tried to keep Ukraine in the fight against its bigger neighbor, Trump has switched back and forth, appearing to support Kyiv one month, Russia the next. He has mostly remained critical of Europe, and that criticism now has a sharper edge.",
      "European leaders have worked to fill the gap and shore up military support for Ukraine, but they concede that the United States is an irreplaceable partner, and Trump is the only person Putin might talk peace with.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned last week that \u201cwe are really witnessing a watershed moment now and nothing is the way it was before. We\u2019re living in a different time, and this time requires different responses than we\u2019ve given in the past.\u201d",
      "Weeks after Trump returned to office in January, his administration signaled that U.S. security interests lie elsewhere: Europe must now look after itself and Ukraine, whose president was humiliated at a White House meeting in February.",

      "In 2018, German artist Michael Triegel asked a homeless man in Rome to pose for a drawing, thinking that he would make an ideal model for St. Peter if he ever needed to paint the first pope",
      "VATICAN CITY -- In 2018, German artist Michael Triegel asked a homeless man in Rome to pose for a drawing, thinking that he would make an ideal model for St. Peter if he ever needed to paint the first pope.",
      "Seven years on, the man\u2019s likeness has gone on display in the Vatican, a reunion of sorts that came about by improbable chance.",
      "This is a story both big and small, of art and faith and a human tragedy that caught the attention of Pope Francis: homeless German man Burkhard Scheffler died from the cold in 2022 on the edge of St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "The saga began in Germany, where Triegel in 2019 won a commission from the Protestant cathedral in the city of Naumburg to create a new central panel for its altar by Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder. The panel would replace an original that was destroyed in 1541 during the Reformation, the upheavals that convulsed parts of Europe as Protestantism emerged in the 16th century.",
      "Cranach\u2019s two side panels survived. Triegel, a Catholic convert, leapt at the prospect of a \u201ccollaboration with Cranach.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had the idea of completing this altar again, in what I find a beautiful gesture \u2014 not to undo these wounds from the 16th century but to mitigate them, to heal them,\u201d he said in an interview in his studio in Leipzig.",
      "Triegel planned out his painting and drew on that encounter he had in 2018 with the homeless man in Rome.",
      "The man took his place as St. Peter among the saints gathered around Mary and the infant Jesus. Triegel said it was important that his subjects not be idealized archetypes but figures the viewer would feel were people \u201cwho could have something to do with me in the here and now, who are not just historic.\u201d",
      "St. Paul was based on a rabbi Triegel drew in Jerusalem, while Mary was modeled on the artist\u2019s daughter. In the back was Protestant pastor and theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, an opponent of the Nazis who was executed in 1945.",
      "Triegel\u2019s St. Peter is bearded, wears a red baseball cap and holds a small key \u2014 a reference to the biblical keys of heaven that are often associated with the saint.",
      "The artist found his saint sitting at the entrance of a Roman church begging. As he was about to give the man money, Triegel recalled, \u201che looked at me and at that moment I had the feeling, if you ever need a Peter for a picture, he would be your Peter \u2014 that flowing beard and those alert eyes.\u201d",
      "Triegel asked the man in Italian whether he could draw and photograph him, and the man just nodded \u2014 \u201cso I had no idea what nation he was from.\u201d",
      "Unbeknownst to Triegel, his St. Peter had a rough time after their 2018 encounter.",
      "The man, Burkhard Scheffler, had suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under Italy's harsh lockdowns, fewer and fewer people ventured out to provide handouts and food to those in need.",
      "Scheffler was arrested in May 2020 after he apparently threatened someone with a knife for refusing to give him change. He was sentenced to three years in prison and released in late 2022.",
      "Known to many in the Vatican, Scheffler had grown weak in prison. \u201cHis hands, which were always warm, had grown cold,\u201d a Vatican journalist, Gudrun Sailer, would later recall.",
      "On the night of Nov. 25, 2022, Scheffler died from the cold.",
      "His death caught the attention of Francis, who had made a priority of caring for the homeless people around the Vatican. Under Francis' watch, the Vatican installed showers, a barber shop and clinic in the colonnade of St. Peter\u2019s. Francis' almsgiver went out on cold nights to distribute sleeping bags.",

      "Hours after Scheffler died, the Vatican spokesperson issued a statement saying he had been cared for by the Vatican\u2019s charity office but \u201cunfortunately, the rain and cold last night contributed to aggravate his fragile condition.\u201d The spokesperson said Francis remembered in his prayer that day \u201cBurkhard and all those who are forced to live without a home, in Rome and the world.\u201d",
      "Shortly after, Francis said in his weekly Sunday prayer: \u201cI remember Burkhard Scheffler, who died three days ago under the colonnade of St. Peter\u2019s Square: died of cold.\u201d",
      "And the pope returned to the theme in his Palm Sunday homily in April 2023. \u201cI think of the German so-called street person, who died under the colonnade, alone and abandoned. He is Jesus for each of us. So many need our closeness, so many are abandoned.\u201d",
      "Francis asked that Scheffler be buried at the Teutonic cemetery on the grounds of the Vatican, alongside many German-speaking priests, pilgrims and notables. His simple tomb is in the small pilgrim section, in the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica and just a few yards from the tomb of the real St. Peter.",
      "Back in Germany, Triegel spent three years working on the altar for the Naumburg Cathedral, but a problem arose.",
      "There were concerns that the Triegel-Cranach altar could cost the building its place on the UNESCO World Heritage List. UNESCO experts felt that it hindered the overall view of the west chapel, including famous statues. In July, regional authorities said the verdict was that the altar could stay \u2014 but would have to be shown elsewhere in the cathedral.",
      "While that discussion played out, the idea arose of lending the altar to the Catholic chapel of the Teutonic pontifical college at the Vatican, a residence for German-speaking priests adjacent to the cemetery. The chapel has an altar of its own from the period of Cranach\u2019s original.",
      "And it was then in the Teutonic chapel that a Vatican-affiliated art expert recognized Triegel's St. Peter as none other than Scheffler.",
      "\u201cSomeone said, 'This guy with the red cap, we know him because he was living here at St. Peter\u2019s Square,\u201d said Monsignor Peter Klasvogt, rector of the Campo Santo Teutonico, as the complex is known. \u201cThat was a moment you never forget.\u201d",
      "The altar is now on a two-year loan to the chapel, a stone's throw from Scheffler's grave, itself just steps from the tomb of St. Peter.",
      "When Triegel learned that his altar might end up next to Scheffler's grave, he recalled thinking, \u201cthere can't be so many coincidences.\u201d",
      "With the arrival of the painting, \u201cthe story gets another outcome and another exit, and this is so wonderful to see,\u201d Klasvogt said. \u201cWe honor him with the altar, we honor him with his grave and we pray here in the church for him.\u201d",
      "After the argument about the altar\u2019s placement in Germany, the coincidence also appeals to the artist.",
      "\u201cIf this whole dispute was necessary for this picture to go to Rome and for this man to be seen again, for him to get a name, for ... people to take notice of him and remember him, then this whole Naumburg project was really worth it for me,\u201d Triegel said.",

      "The center in Johannesburg was processing applications by white South Africans under the Trump administration's new program giving them priority for refugee status in the U.S.",
      "The Kenyans were working at the center alongside U.S. officials despite entering South Africa on tourist visas which did not allow them to work, the Home Affairs Ministry said in a statement. It said no U.S. officials were arrested in the raid Tuesday and it was not a diplomatic site.",
      "The raid is bound to increase tensions between the U.S. and South Africa. U.S. President Donald Trump has been especially critical of the South African government since he returned to office, claiming the country is violently persecuting its white Afrikaner minority and also pursuing an anti-American foreign policy.",
      "Trump\u2019s widely rejected claims over the treatment of Afrikaners in South Africa led to his administration setting up the program offering them refugee status in the U.S.",
      "South Africa's government has said that white South Africans do not meet the criteria for refugee status because there is no persecution but says it won't stop them applying for relocation under the U.S. program.",
      "The South African Home Affairs Ministry didn't immediately say who the Kenyans worked for, but the U.S. government contracted a Kenya-based company, RSC Africa, to process the refugee applications by white South Africans, according to the U.S. Embassy in South Africa. RSC is operated by Church World Service, a U.S.-based nongovernment organization offering humanitarian aid and refugee assistance across the world.",
      "The statement by South Africa's Home Affairs Ministry said Kenyan nationals had previously been denied visas to travel to South Africa to work on the U.S. refugee program and questioned why the workers who entered the country on tourist visas were working at the refugee application site alongside U.S. officials.",

      "Soldiers would either have been part of the emperor's guard or stationed there for city security, she added.",

      "Many of the squatters lived from selling scrap metal collected from the streets.

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half the workers because they are worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision they plan to announce Wednesday will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Donald Trump. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs for all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\u201cThis proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\u201d Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between \u2019Hell or the highway.' \u201d",
      "The unions say they are worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides over the past two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they are optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Shareholders of both railroads overwhelmingly support it.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",

      "The accord has been under negotiation for 25 years, and once ratified would cover a market of 780 million people and a quarter of the globe\u2019s gross domestic product.",
      "EU lawmakers voted Tuesday to advance the deal by adding new safeguards to it in addition to approving concessions to farmers made by the European Commission. Nonetheless it is still likely to be delayed because three key demands from the French have not yet been met.",
      "In France, an agricultural powerhouse in the European Union, farmers\u2019 concerns about the Mercosur trade deal are combining with anger about government sanitary measures against the spread of a bovine disease, creating a volatile cocktail of rural discontent and growing protest.",

French media reporting from other demonstrations around the country this week showed farmers piling up potatoes, tires, straw bales and other things they had at hand to make barricades. Some were set on fire, creating dramatic television images of flames and smoke that gave an impression of bubbling rural fury, even though some of the protests were relatively small and scattered.",
      "\u201cIn France, we\u2019re very well known for being real grumblers, very unhappy,\u201d Rivi\u00e8re said of farmers\u2019 proven skills at making their anger known. \u201cWe have tractors, they\u2019re big and very visual.\u201d",
      "Motorists showed their support for the protesting farmers by tooting their horns, he said. \u201cThe ambiance is good,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms.",
      "\u201cI feel like there\u2019s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don\u2019t matter,\u201d Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. \"That\u2019s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.\u201d",
      "Flink is among this year's five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals.",
      "The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical.",
      "The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder's net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world.",
      "Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model.",
      "S\u00e1nchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last year that her children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Fly Who Flew to Space,\" is for \"the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn't smart.\" She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested.",
      "The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award's previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice.",
      "The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos\u2019 ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today\u2019s entrepreneur-philanthropists \u2014 Bill Gates, for example \u2014 tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education.",
      "\u201cRather than trying to change the system, what they\u2019re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,\u201d Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. \u201cIt really is a much older model of philanthropy.\u201d",

      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration says he won\u2019t forget the 67 people who died when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., in January",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday he won't forget the 67 people who died when an airliner collided with an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., in January, insisting he won't allow operations in the airspace over the nation's capital to revert back to the way they were before the crash.",
      "Administrator Bryan Bedford gave the House aviation subcommittee an update on a number of key concerns about his agency during Tuesday's hearing, including whether he believes the provisions of a major defense bill that have been widely criticized by safety experts will make flying riskier.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, it\u2019s beyond unfortunate, it\u2019s tragic that the focus that we have today \u2014 the attention and our sort of unified, galvanized effort to modernize \u2014 was paid for with the lives of 67 Americans. It\u2019s unfortunate, but that sacrifice can\u2019t go to waste,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cWe have to deliver for them and for the rest of the American people.\u201d",
      "Bedford promised he won't allow the airspace to become less safe, even though critics have said the defense bill would open the door to allowing military helicopters to resume flying through the crowded airspace around Washington without broadcasting their locations. The FAA required all aircraft to use ADS-B systems in the wake of the collision, and changed its practices to ensure that helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace and that controllers no longer rely on pilots to ensure visual separation between aircraft.",
      "\u201cThere's no rolling back of the safety procedures we put in place since that horrific evening,\u201d Bedford said without taking a position on the defense bill. \"Our vigilance isn't waning.\"",
      "Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., are urgently trying to amend the defense bill, but that may not happen because congressional leaders don't want to risk delaying that bill by sending it back to the House for another vote. If changing the defense bill is not possible, Cruz and Cantwell have promised to push for approval of a bill they introduced last summer that would require all aircraft to broadcast their locations.",
      "Separately, Bedford responded in a letter to ethics concerns Cantwell raised last week about why he hadn't sold off his stake in Republic Airways, which he used to lead as CEO, as promised within 90 days after he was confirmed.",
      "Bedford told government ethics officials that he hadn't initially sold off his investment because he got busy at work once he took over the FAA. He said he worked to get started on the planned overhaul of the air traffic control system and then dealt with controller shortages during the shutdown, and then he thought he had extra time because ethics officials might not decide on his request for an extension during the shutdown.",
      "But in an email that Bedford included with his letter, an official with the ethics office said he should have known he wouldn't get an extension after an Oct. 7 call when officials \u201cconveyed being busy with your position did not constitute an \u2018unusual hardship.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bedford said he will continue to recuse himself from any decisions involving Republic until his multimillion-dollar investment is sold, but he predicted that still might not happen right away. He said Republic has yet to send him his share certificates after completing its merger with Mesa Air Group last month.",
      "Bedford told the committee that by the end of the year the FAA expects to have committed more than $6 billion of the $12.5 billion Congress approved to pay for an overhaul of the nation's air traffic control system. The agency has already replaced more than one-third of the outdated copper wires the system was relying on with modern connections like fiber optic lines.",

Johnson questioned whether this is a \u201cpay-to-play situation.\u201d Peraton is owned by a massive private equity firm called Veritas Capital.",
      "\u201cHow is the FAA ensuring that outsourcing this massive modernization project to a largely untested contractor will not put safety at risk, create further delays or overburden your already overworked workforce?\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Bedford said Peraton was chosen because it has expertise in helping the Defense Department and NASA convert systems from analog to digital and moving those systems to the cloud online. The other contractor that applied for the job, Parsons, has worked with FAA extensively, but Bedford said it didn't have that cloud experience and the FAA wants to move its computing power out of individual towers to a national system that's based online.",
      "\u201cPeraton brought a competency that is relevant to what we need. It had nothing to do with who they knew. The president did not interfere, nor did the secretary in the selection process. It was transparent. It was diligent,\u201d he said.",
      "In a letter to lawmakers, Bedford also defended the FAA's decision during the government shutdown to order airlines to cut thousands of flights because of concerns about air controller staffing and safety data. But instead of offering additional details about what that decision was based on, Bedford essentially repeated the reasons Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy offered at the time.",
      "Bedford said safety experts at the FAA noticed a dramatic increase in controller absences along with an uptick in near misses and runway incursions, but he didn't offer any data on those incidents.",
      "\u201cI am confident that decreasing operations during an uncertain and stressful time was the right decision on behalf of the flying public and the United States,\u201d Bedford said.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union envoys worked on Tuesday to narrow gaps on a plan to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets as collateral for a massive loan to cover Ukraine's economic and military needs over the next two years, ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders later this week.",
      "Almost four years into Russia\u2019s full-scale war on Ukraine, the leaders have committed to funding Kyiv\u2019s needs, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion). Ukraine is desperate to secure the money by early 2026.",

      "EU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the plan as \u201ctheft.\u201d",
      "Then last Friday, the EU placed an indefinite freeze on the assets \u2014 estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion) \u2014 to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can\u2019t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.",
      "It also ensures that the assets can't be used by the United States or Russia in any Ukraine peace negotiations without European approval.",

      "Plan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic. But many of Europe\u2019s major economies are cash-strapped and mired in debt.",

      "Latino is the CEO of Lee Display, a Fairfield, California-based company that his great-grandfather founded in 1902. Back then, it specialized in handmade velvet and silk flowers for hats. Now, it's one of the only companies in the United States that still makes artificial Christmas trees, producing around 10,000 each year.",
      "Tariffs shone a twinkling light this year on fake Christmas trees \u2014 and the extent to which America depends on other countries for its plastic fir trees.",
      "Prices for fake trees rose 10% to 15% this year due to the new import taxes, according to the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Tree sellers cut their orders and paid higher tariffs for the stock they brought in.",
      "Despite those issues, tree companies say they aren\u2019t likely to shift large-scale production back to the U.S. after decades in Asia. Fake trees are labor-intensive and require holiday lights and other components the U.S. doesn\u2019t make, said Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Co., which sells more than 1 million artificial trees each year.",

      "About 80% of the U.S. residents who put up a Christmas tree this year planned to use a fake one, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. That percentage has been unchanged for at least 15 years.",
      "Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of Balsam Brands, which sells hundreds of thousands of Balsam Hill trees each year, said Americans like to set up their trees on Thanksgiving and leave them up for weeks, which dries out fresh-cut trees. Others prefer fake trees because they\u2019re allergic to the mold spores on real trees, he said.",
      "Americans also like convenience; 80% of the fake trees sold each year have the lights already strung on them, Butler said.",
      "That preference is one reason artificial tree production shifted away from the U.S., first to Thailand in the early 1990s and to China about a decade later. Winding lights around the branches is time-consuming and tedious, Harman said.",
      "\u201cWhere are we going to get 15,000 people in America who want to string lights on Christmas trees?\u201d Harman said.",
      "It takes an hour or two to make an artificial Christmas tree, from molding and cutting the needles to tying branches together and attaching the lights, Butler said. Workers in China, where 90% of fake trees are made, are paid $1.50 to $2 per hour, he said.",
      "Harman said the workers who wrap the lights on Balsam Hill's trees are so efficient \u201cit's like watching an Olympian.\u201d",
      "One of Balsam Brands\u2019 Chinese partners employs 15,000 to 20,000 people; another in Indonesia has up to 10,000, he said. Many are seasonal workers, since orders for Christmas d\u00e9cor slow down between October and February.",
      "Balsam Brands, which is based in Redwood City, California, studied whether it could make faux trees in Ohio during the first Trump administration, when President Donald Trump threatened -\u2013 but eventually delayed \u2013- tariffs on imported Christmas d\u00e9cor, Harman said.",

It's getting low on lights, so next year it will have to pay more to import them, he said.",
      "Some artificial tree companies are branching out so they\u2019re less reliant on China. National Tree Co., which is based in Cranford, New Jersey, moved some manufacturing to Cambodia in 2024, and could source all its trees from outside China by next year if it wanted to, Butler said.",
      "But diversifying their suppliers didn't make those companies immune from the impact of tariffs either. In April, the Trump administration threatened a 49% tariff against products from Cambodia. That rate was eventually reduced to 19%. Tariffs on artificial trees from China also bounced around but now average 20%, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.",
      "Butler said his company imported fewer trees this year and also raised prices by 10%. He said he used a lot of the money to offer customer discounts since demand was weak because of consumer worries about the economy.",

      "Balsam Brands cut its workforce by 10%, canceled travel, froze raises and even stopped serving lunch in the office once a week to absorb the impact of tariffs, Harman said. It also raised tree prices by 10%.",
      "Harman said his sales are down 5% to 10% this year in the U.S. but up 10% or more in Germany, Australia, Canada and France. That tells him tariffs have decreased U.S. demand.",
      "\u201cIf a merry Christmas is measured in how many decorations people put up, by that measure it's going to be a slightly less merry Christmas,\u201d he said.",

      "DETROIT -- Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are suing President Donald Trump\u2019s administration for what they say is the unlawful withholding of over $2 billion dollars in funding for two electric vehicle charging programs, according to a federal lawsuit announced Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington is the latest legal battle that several states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are \u201cimpounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. \u201cThis is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.\"",
      "The Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to request for comment.",
      "The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.",
      "Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.",
      "Tuesday's separate lawsuit addresses the withholding of funding obligations for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million in Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator money.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania.",

      "Once in office a second time, President Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden's \u201cEV mandate.\u201d While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, policies did not force American consumers to buy or automakers to sell electric vehicles.",
      "Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV uptake, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix.",
      "Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe rules and the gas mileage standards, cut the fines to automakers for not meeting those standards, and eliminated the EV credits.",

      "Nearly 40% of the $5 billion total came from the Knights\u2019 gift to Oregon Health & Science University. More than $1.3 billion, or about one-quarter of the total, came from four donations to Buffett family foundations.",
      "The top three gifts went toward cancer care and research, a private grantmaker, and an international effort to fight hunger and malnutrition among women and children. Two donations totaling $600 million went to university athletics programs. One gift of $300 million backed the construction of a new hospital and an effort to expand the health care workforce in South Dakota.

      "Their gift was the result of a long relationship between OHSU professor Brian Druker, one of the country\u2019s most celebrated cancer researchers, and the Knights, which began nearly two decades ago. Impressed with Druker\u2019s work, the couple gave OHSU three nine-figure donations before this year\u2019s windfall, starting with their $100 million naming gift in 2008. They have given Oregon Health & Science a total of at least $2.7 billion over the years.",
      "The Knights\u2019 donation is followed by a gift from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, who gave 1.5 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock valued at $746.7 million in November to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, who died in 2004.",
      "Buffett, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at more than $146 billion, created the grantmaker in 1964 to manage the family\u2019s charitable giving, and it remains a family affair. Two of his three children serve on its board, and it is led by his former son-in-law. The foundation primarily backs women\u2019s reproductive health. It also provides college scholarships for students in Nebraska, where the family is from.",

      "Following the Knights' and Buffett's gifts is a donation from two lesser-known philanthropists, the late Jackie Bezos and her husband, Mike, the mother and stepfather of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The couple invested $245,000 in Amazon when Jeff Bezos launched the company in 1995, and while their net worth is unknown, it is likely considerable.",

      "Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr is set to testify before lawmakers for the first time since pressuring broadcasters over late-night host Jimmy Kimmel",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr will face Senate questioning Wednesday for the first time since he pressured broadcasters to take ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air, a stance that drew bipartisan criticism and raised concerns about government interference in the media.",
      "Carr will appear before the Senate Commerce committee for an oversight hearing that will also include the FCC\u2019s two other commissioners, Olivia Trusty and Anna M. Gomez. It will be the first Senate Commerce oversight hearing with all FCC commissioners since 2020, though there are two vacancies on the five-member panel.",
      "Since being tapped by President Donald Trump last November to lead the nation\u2019s top broadcast regulator, Carr has closely aligned with the administration\u2019s aggressive posture toward media outlets it views as hostile. He has launched FCC investigations into ABC, CBS and NBC News, in addition to some local stations.",
      "Trump in his second term has sued The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and, most recently, the BBC. And at Trump's urging, Congress this summer approved eliminating $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting.",
      "Earlier this year, Carr came under fire from lawmakers in both parties after he denounced Kimmel\u2019s comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. He called Kimmel's remarks \u201ctruly sick\u201d and warned broadcasters, \u201cWe can do this the easy way or the hard way.\u201d Hours later, ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended indefinitely.",
      "Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz, who scheduled the hearing last month, was among the Republicans who criticized Carr\u2019s remarks at the time.",
      "\u201cI think it is unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying we\u2019re going to decide what speech we like and what we don\u2019t, and we\u2019re going to threaten to take you off air if we don\u2019t like what you\u2019re saying,\u201d Cruz said on his podcast, calling Carr\u2019s comments \u201cdangerous as hell.\u201d",

      "The hearing comes as Carr faces additional scrutiny from Democrats over media consolidation. Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen, a member of the committee, joined other Democrats this week in urging Carr to closely examine Nexstar Media Group\u2019s proposed acquisition of rival broadcaster Tegna.",
      "In a letter sent Tuesday, the lawmakers warned the deal would further concentrate media power in the U.S. local television market.",
      "\u201cRegulatory approval of the conglomerate would likely raise prices for consumers, accelerate job losses, and weaken the independence and news coverage of local TV stations,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The transaction would require the FCC to loosen rules limiting how many stations a single company may own. Carr has said he is open to changing those ownership limits. Nexstar was one of two ABC affiliate owners that said they would preempt Kimmel\u2019s show with local programming following his comments about Kirk.",
      "Kimmel's suspension came after his monologue included a reference to Kirk\u2019s shooting and compared Trump\u2019s grief to \u201chow a 4-year-old mourns a goldfish.\u201d The show returned to air less than a week after the indefinite suspension was announced.",

      "\u201cZootopia 2\u201d has regained the No. 1 spot at the box office with $26.3 million in its third weekend of release",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cZootopia 2\u201d regained the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office with $26.3 million in its third weekend of release, according to studio estimates Sunday, as The Walt Disney Co. animated sequel became the year\u2019s second film to gross $1 billion worldwide.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",
      "The only other 2025 Hollywood title to surpass $1 billion worldwide was Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion). The highest grossing movie of the year, though, is the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which collected nearly $2 billion just in China.",
      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",
      "But box-office expectations weren\u2019t high coming in from \u201cElla McCay,\u201d a comic drama about a 34-year-old woman (newcomer Emma Mackey) who becomes governor of her home state. Reviews (22% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor, and the kind of award-winning comic dramas movies that Brooks (\u201cTerms of Endearment,\u201d \u201cBroadcast News\u201d) has long specialized in today seldom find large audiences in theaters. \u201cElla McCay,\u201d featuring a supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri and Woody Harrelson, cost $35 million to make.",
      "With overall ticket sales on the year running close to even with last year's disappointing grosses, according to Comscore data, Hollywood will be hoping the coming holiday corridor, traditionally the busiest moviegoing period of the year, ends 2025 on a high note. Movies on tap include \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d \u201cAnaconda\u201d and \u201cSong Sung Blue.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is pivoting away from its once-ambitious electric vehicle plans amid financial losses and waning consumer demand for the vehicles in lieu of investment in more efficient gasoline-engines and hybrid EVs, the company said Monday.",
      "The Detroit automaker, which has poured billions of dollars into electrification along with most of its industry peers, said it will no longer make the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, instead opting for an extended range version of the vehicle.",
      "Ford will also introduce some manufacturing changes; its Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center \u2014 part of the BlueOval City campus and once the future of Ford's EVs and batteries \u2014 is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant and will produce new affordable gas-powered trucks instead. Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant will produce a new gas and hybrid van.",
      "The company has lost $13 billion on EVs since 2023 and said it expects to take a $19.5 billion hit largely in the fourth quarter due to the EV business.",
      "\u201cThis is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,\u201d CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. \u201cThe operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.\u201d",
      "Ford said it now expects half of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs \u2014 which also incorporate a gasoline-powered engine \u2014 and full EVs by 2030, up from 17% this year.",
      "\u201cFord\u2019s elimination of the electric F-150 Lightning is not much of a surprise after the truck failed to come close to filling the plant\u2019s capacity. Ford\u2019s choice to convert an existing gas-powered truck to accept the electric drivetrain helped reduce their upfront costs which, in hindsight, was the right move,\u201d Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cFor months, the future of Blue Oval City has been in question and this announcement locks in the direction of this large plant,\" Fiorani added. \"Adding an affordable vehicle to the Ford lineup fills a glaring gap in the market.\u201d",
      "Several other automakers have made changes to their electrified product plans in recent years as consumer demand for EVs in the U.S. hasn't quite met expectations.",
      "EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicles sales in the U.S. last year, but factors such as cost and charging infrastructure remain concerns for mainstream buyers.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff recalls being \u201cdevastated\u201d when it became clear last spring that he would be unable to play his final season of college football at BYU.",
      "His penchant for making plays in big moments, as well as for publicly embracing his Jewish heritage, made him something of a celebrated novelty at the Utah school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where he became known as \u201cBYJew.\u201d",
      "Suffice it to say he's landed on his feet at Tulane \u2014 a university with a relatively large concentration of Jewish students, around 3,000 in all.",
      "The \u201cBayou Jew\u201d has help lead the Green Wave (11-2) to an American Conference championship and a first College Football Playoff berth. Tulane, seeded 11th, visits No. 6 seed Mississippi on Saturday.",
      "Retzlaff has been \u201ca perfect fit\u201d at Tulane, said Dave Cariello, owner of the Campus Connection, which sells Green Wave merchandise and partners with players on name, image and likeness deals.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly been our top-selling NIL athlete,\" Cariello said. \u201cThere seems to be a larger appetite for Jake\u2019s stuff and I believe that\u2019s partly because of his Jewish background. The other part is he\u2019s the starting quarterback.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff went 11-2 as starter in 2024 at BYU, which narrowly missed out on playing for a Big 12 title. He was looking forward to returning to the Cougars in 2025 when he was named in a since-dismissed civil sexual assault lawsuit.",
      "While Retzlaff contended the relationship in question was consensual, that was a problem at BYU, where the university's honor code requires students to abstain from premarital sex. Had he remained enrolled there, he'd have been suspended.",
      "Retzlaff was confident he'd get offers from other competitive college programs. But at Tulane, he found that and more.",
      "\u201cGod\u2019s got a plan. And that\u2019s the hardest thing to realize in the worst of times,\" Retzlaff said. \u201cI had everything great. It gets taken from me. And now I got to go make lemonade.",
      "\u201cAnd I get to meet all these people and create all these relationships\u201d at Tulane and around New Orleans.",
      "Retzlaff did not arrive at Tulane until July, giving him a compressed timeline to learn the Wave's offense and bond with teammates. He started by trying to sit with different players during each team meal inside Yulman Stadium.",
      "\u201cGuys have their groups that they usually eat lunch with or dinner with and I\u2019m like, all right, I\u2019m just going to jump in,\u201d Retzlaff recalled.",
      "The dual-threat quarterback from California thrived under offensive coordinator Joe Craddock, an Alabama native who said the pace of Retzlaff's compressed integration reminded him of NASCAR races at Talladega.",
      "Retzlaff passed for 2,862 yards and 14 TDs with six interceptions this season. He also has been Tulane's leading rusher with 610 yards and 16 touchdowns \u2014 a record for rushing touchdowns in a season by a Green Wave QB.",

      "\u201cThat's what we get to do by going to play in the College Football Playoff,\" Retzlaff said. \u201c\u2018Jewlane\u2019 and the \u2018Bayou Jew\u2019 get to go make a headline and be more positive about Judaism and the faith and how this is possible.\u201d",

      "PITTSBURGH -- It felt a little bit like Green Bay. And for Aaron Rodgers, it looked a little like Green Bay, too.",
      "Frigid conditions. High stakes. The number of games dwindling.",
      "During the four-time MVP's long run with the Packers, this was the time of year that Rodgers thrived. And while Pittsburgh is not Green Bay and the 2025 version of Rodgers is not quite the 2015 version, he offered a reminder on Monday night against Miami that there's still life in his 42-year-old right arm, and in his maddeningly hot-and-cold team.",
      "Rodgers passed for 224 yards and two touchdowns and Pittsburgh kept its grasp on the top spot in the AFC North with a clinical 28-15 victory over the Dolphins, who were eliminated from playoff contention.",
      "While Rodgers wasn't quite in what he called a \u201cflow state,\u201d he certainly looked comfortable while becoming the oldest quarterback in league history to complete at least 85% of his passes. Rodgers connected on 23 of 27 against the Dolphins, including third-quarter touchdown throws of 19 yards to Marquez Valdes-Scantling and 28 yards to DK Metcalf.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s the best quarterback to ever play this game,\u201d said Valdes-Scantling, who played alongside Rodgers with the Packers and signed with Pittsburgh's practice squad earlier this season. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s 65 years old or not, he can still spin the ball and he\u2019s always playing chess with the defense.\u201d",
      "Throwing short passes that got the ball out of his hands quickly, Rodgers was fine working underneath and letting Pittsburgh's skill position players do the work. Running back Kenneth Gainwell had 126 total yards, including a team-high seven receptions. Metcalf's touchdown catch \u2014 he shoved former Steeler Minkah Fitzpatrick out of the way en route to the end zone \u2014 came on a pass between two defenders that echoed Rodgers in his prime.",
      "The Steelers (8-6) maintained their one-game lead over Baltimore in the division with three weeks to go. As spotty as Pittsburgh has looked at times, everything remains on the table as Christmas approaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been a part of stuff like this,\u201d said Rodgers, who last made the playoffs in 2021. \u201cNothing changes. It\u2019s just, I feel real comfortable in this environment.\u201d",
      "Miami (6-8) saw its slim playoff hopes vanish in the chill as its four-game winning streak was snapped. The Dolphins prepped by practicing in the snow at nearby Robert Morris University over the weekend, but it didn't help.",
      "While Miami took a 3-0 lead during a sluggish first half on Riley Patterson's career-long 54-yard field goal, Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins' offense had no answer once Rodgers heated up.",
      "Tagovailoa completed 22 of 28 passes for 254 yards with two garbage-time touchdowns to Darren Waller and his NFL-leading 15th interception. De'Von Achane, who had powered Miami's recovering from a 1-6 start, ran for 60 yards and caught six passes for 68 more but was a nonfactor during the middle portion of the game, when the Steelers scored touchdowns on four straight possessions to remain unbeaten at home on Monday nights since 1992.",
      "Tagovailoa remained winless in games where the temperature at kickoff was under 40 degrees. Miami had minus-20 yards of total offense in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cIt's disapppointing we didn't get the outcome we wanted to, and everything that goes on with the playoffs,\" Tagovailoa said. \u201cWhen you start the season the way we did, we made it hard on ourselves.\u201d",

      "Fernando Moreno has been waiting for a kidney transplant for about two years",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Fernando Moreno has been on dialysis for about two years, enduring an \u201cunbearable\u201d wait for a new kidney to save his life. His limited world of social contacts has meant that his hopes have hinged on inching up the national waiting list for a transplant.",
      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them. A second effort, a pilot program with three patients in North Carolina that ended last year, helped match all three with living donors.",

      "Living kidney donations can be a better match, reducing the risk of organ rejection. They allow for surgery to be planned for a time that is optimal for the donor, the recipient and the transplant team. And, the foundation says, living donor kidneys, on average, last longer than kidneys from deceased donors.",
      "The National Kidney Foundation says living donors must be at least 18 years old, although some transplant centers set the minimum age at 21. Potential donors get screened for health problems and can be ruled out if they have uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes or cancer, or if they are smokers.",
      "Many living donors make \u201cdirected donations\u201d to specify who will get their kidney. Nondirected donations are made anonymously to a patient.",

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "A congressional report says China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications",
      "WASHINGTON -- China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers funded by the Department of Energy to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications, according to a congressional report published Wednesday.",
      "The authors of the report say the U.S. must do more to protect high-tech research and ensure that the results of taxpayer-funded work don't end up benefiting Beijing. They recommended several changes to better protect scientific research in the U.S., including new policies for the Department of Energy to use when deciding whether to fund work that involves Chinese partnerships.",
      "The investigation is part of a congressional push to raise a firewall blocking U.S. research from boosting China's military buildup when the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry that will shape the future global order.",
      "Investigators from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce identified more than 4,300 academic papers published between June 2023 and June of this year that involved collaborations between DOE-funded scientists and Chinese researchers. About half of the papers involved Chinese researchers affiliated with China's military or industrial base.",
      "Particularly concerning, investigators found that federal funds went to research collaborations with Chinese state-owned laboratories and universities that work directly for China\u2019s military, including some listed in a Pentagon database of Chinese military companies with operations in the U.S. The report also detailed collaborations between U.S. researchers and groups blamed for cyberattacks as well as human rights abuses in China.",
      "The Energy Department routinely funds advanced research into nuclear energy and the development and disposal of nuclear weaponry, along with a long list of other high-tech fields like quantum computing, materials science and physics. It doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research. The department oversees 17 national laboratories that have led the development in many technologies.",
      "The report followed a number of congressional investigations into federally funded research involving Chinese scientists and researchers. Last year, a report released by Republicans found that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade had allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology that could help strengthen its military. Another investigation this year revealed that the Pentagon in a recent two-year period funded hundreds of projects in collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense industry.",
      "The Energy Department has failed for decades to take steps to ensure the research it funds doesn't benefit China, the report's authors found. They made several recommendations to tighten the rules, including a new standardized approach to assessing the national security risks of research, as well as requirements that the department share information about research ties with China with other U.S. government agencies to make it easier to spot problems.",

      "The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to questions about the report and its recommendations. A message seeking comment was left with the Chinese Embassy in Washington.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the select committee, said in a statement that the \u201cinvestigation reveals a deeply alarming problem: The Department of Energy failed to ensure the security of its research and it put American taxpayers on the hook for funding the military rise of our nation\u2019s foremost adversary.\u201d",
      "Moolenaar this year introduced legislation aimed at preventing research funding in science and technology and defense from going to collaborations or partnerships with \u201cforeign adversary-controlled\u201d entities that pose a national security risk.",
      "The legislation cleared the House but failed to advance to become part of the annual sweeping defense policy bill. It was met with strong opposition from scientists and researchers, who argued that the measures were too broad and could chill collaboration and undermine America's competitive edge in science and technology.",
      "In an October letter, a group of more than 750 faculty members and senior staffers from American universities told congressional leaders overseeing the armed services that the U.S. is in a global competition for talent. They called for \u201cvery careful and targeted measures for risk management\" to address security concerns.",

      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",

      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",

      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",

      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",

      "Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, fearing persecution from the Chinese government",
      "MIDLAND, Texas -- Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang was recuperating from cancer on a Korean resort island when he got an urgent call: Don\u2019t return to China, a friend warned. You\u2019re now a fugitive.",
      "Days later, a stranger snapped a photo of Li in a cafe. Terrified South Korea would send him back, Li fled, flew to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",
      "\u201cThey track you 24 hours a day. All your electronics, your phone \u2014 they\u2019ll use every method to find you, your relatives, your friends, where you live,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo matter where you are, you\u2019re under their control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",
      "Outside China, the same technology is being used to threaten wayward officials, along with dissidents and alleged criminals, under what authorities call Operations \u201cFox Hunt\u201d and \u201cSky Net.\u201d The U.S. has criticized these overseas operations as a \u201cthreat\u201d and an \u201caffront to national sovereignty.\u201d More than 14,000 people, including some 3,000 officials, have been brought back to China from more than 120 countries through coercion, arrests and pressure on relatives, according to state information.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "In February 2020, agents came for Li\u2019s friend and former deputy, district chief Kong Lingbao, who had criticized Beijing\u2019s censorship of key information in the COVID-19 pandemic.\u202fA rival secretly recorded Kong saying during a private dinner that he could no longer work for the party. Kong was summoned to the local discipline inspection office and never came out: he was being investigated for \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d.",
      "Kong\u2019s arrest prompted a friend to ring Li in Korea and warn him. That July, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into Li.",
      "A month later, Li told The Epoch Times, a dissident Chinese publication, that he had quit the party, and portrayed himself as a dissident. He says he did not know he was under investigation at the time.",
      "A week after the interview was published, strangers stalked Li at the unveiling of a sculpture dedicated to pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, asking menacing questions and tailing him by car. Agents identified the address of one of his safe houses.",

      "Beijing tapped phones, seized assets and installed cameras outside the homes of friends and family. Some detained were denied surgery or other medical care, even those recovering from heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Li\u2019s aunt was released from a hospital in a vegetative state with bruises on her head and all over her body. Even the Li family grave was dug up.",
      "Li\u2019s friend, Kong, was sentenced to over a decade in prison for allegedly taking bribes. The party claimed he had watched porn and ignored his work, which they blamed for the spread of COVID in his district. Furious, Li kept speaking out.",
      "In December 2020, a man from Shanghai posing as a private investigator approached Zheng Cunzhu, vice chairman of the dissident China Democracy Party. The man offered $100,000 in bribes for information on Li and promised more if he obstructed Li\u2019s bid for asylum, Zheng said in an interview and a letter.",
      "In February 2021, Li learned the Chinese government had asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice declaring to police worldwide that Li was a wanted man. Interpol retracted the Red Notice after Li filed a complaint.",
      "Li began donning masks and hats in public and carrying multiple phones, wary of surveillance. He floated from safe house to safe house with Christians across the United States.",
      "In October 2024, a Chinese court announced that Li was suspected of corruption totaling over 3.1 billion RMB, or roughly $435 million. The government claimed they seized 1,021 properties, 38 vehicles, and 18 companies belonging to Li and charged his relatives and associates with crimes related to Li. The lawyers who reviewed the case told AP there were serious anomalies with the charges.",
      "Many of the lawyers Li has tried to hire were rejected, threatened, and put under surveillance. At least three were summoned by Chinese legal authorities. They were told Li\u2019s case was \u201cpolitical\u201d and important to leaders from Beijing, and warned against speaking publicly, according to memos viewed by AP.",
      "\u201cOnce you get to the point that you\u2019re criticizing the party, it\u2019s no holds barred,\u201d said Ryan Mitchell, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cResistance is punished.\u201d",
      "In a courthouse in China, Li\u2019s friends and family faced legal proceedings tied to his corruption charges. A plainclothes officer outside stopped an AP reporter from taking photos, saying a \u201csensitive political case\u201d was being heard.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t show any evidence. Instead, they told a story,\u201d one of the lawyers told AP, declining to be named because they were warned against speaking to the press. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even show us the accusations.\u201d",
      "Authorities in Heilongjiang, where the proceedings were held, did not respond to a faxed request for comment.",
      "Li is now cut off from friends and family, denied legal assistance and clueless even to the details of the charges against him. So he is once again resorting to speaking out \u2014 this time on YouTube.",
      "Li acknowledges the situation seems hopeless. But he\u2019s pressing on.",

      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",

But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",

In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach. And one of the things Orthodoxy hasn\u2019t had in forever is reach.\u201d",

      "Part of what\u2019s fueling the perception that only men are converting is that many influencers overlap with the so-called manosphere \u2014 content online that caters toward men grappling with their understanding of masculinity. Orthodoxy is often billed as an alternative or supplement to self-help advice for young men.",
      "\u201cAs a theologian, the idea that somehow masculinity \u2014 this particular way of thinking about masculinity \u2014 is inherent to Orthodox theology and teaching is I think just completely wrong,\u201d said Aristotle Papanikolaou, cofounding director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no logic to the idea that somehow I need to be masculine in this particular way in order to unite myself with God.\u201d",
      "Though appealing to some, others believe these influencers distort their idea of Christianity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my cup of tea,\u201d said Aaron Velasco, a 26-year-old filmmaker chrismated last year.",
      "And while Velasco did take an interest in some content creators, and appreciates Pageau\u2019s demeanor and perspective, he thinks many of them preach an inflammatory version of the faith that doesn\u2019t fit his current understanding of it.",
      "Many adherents say the broader church is more ideologically diverse than the rigid conservatism often found online.",
      "\u201cLook at the institutional church. There is this huge hierarchy where women are not present. It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s not a masculine image,\u201d said Dina Zingaro, who is studying Orthodoxy at Harvard Divinity School and who was raised in the faith. \u201cAt the same time, there are so many counter-narratives in Orthodoxy that uproot this idea.\u201d",
      "Church leaders have made few public responses, however some clergy are beginning to speak more about the magnitude of this influx and its accompanying challenges.",
      "\u201cThere are cases of extremism and fundamentalism,\u201d said Metropolitan Saba, leader of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, during an address last month in Denver. \u201cMany who are coming to the church today are psychologically, emotionally or socially wounded, which requires experienced and mature spiritual fathers and mothers.\u201d",
      "Zingaro, who preaches regularly and teaches courses for Orthodox women on preaching, hopes church leadership will be more vocal.",
      "\u201cOur response in my mind has not been strong enough,\u201d Zingaro said. \u201cThere\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing that is making people think it\u2019s OK to make these claims about Orthodoxy. We need to lift up the real spirit and the core of Orthodoxy, which is really the opposite of this rule-based male domination version.\u201d",

Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",
      "Ainebyona carries binoculars and takes note of what he sees. The goal is to increase the chimp numbers and extract more tourism revenue. At Kibale, a permit to track chimps costs a foreign visitor $250.",
      "Tourist guide Alex Turyatunga told The Associated Press that the habituation process is enlightening. He and his colleagues have been trying to fully habituate the Kisongi group for more than a decade, he said.",
      "\u201cWe try to learn about these chimpanzees, but they also try to learn about us,\u201d Turyatunga said.",

      "To succeed, habituators can focus on alphas like Jean, targeting them repeatedly until others in the group notice their comfort around people. One individual can help others \u201cget on board,\u201d Turyatunga said.",
      "The common chimpanzee is one of two primate species with the closest evolutionary ties to humans. Scientists cite nearly 99% DNA similarity between humans and chimps \u2014 similar for bonobos.",
      "Habituators like Ainebyona must show a willingness to interact closely with chimps, said Ankunda Viola Ariho, Kibale's tourism warden.",
      "\u201cWe look at the attitude. That\u2019s very important,\u201d she said, speaking of habituators. \u201cYou are not going to work doing this job, if you don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist who died in October, built strong bonds with the chimps she studied in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park. Her work helped shape a sympathetic view of the chimp as an emotionally complex creature. The species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, facing threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
      "Kibale National Park received enhanced protected status in 1993 after the forest had been encroached upon by hundreds of people who built homes there and felled trees for firewood. The park is now thriving, thanks in part to the habituation efforts that make it possible for tourists to contribute directly to chimp conservation.",
      "Chimp habituation can open up research opportunities that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, and Kibale is home to one of the longest-running field stations in the tropics, said David Morgan, who co-directs the Goualougo Triangle Ape Project in the Republic of Congo.",
      "\u201cIf chimps don\u2019t want to be seen, they\u2019re incredibly good at disappearing,\u201d said Morgan, who also is a chimpanzee and gorilla expert at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.",
      "Chimp habituation and related tourism can improve how the public interacts with the apes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe communities that are habituated, they serve as kind of an emblem of the importance of what we can learn from them and what we stand to gain by protecting them and what we stand to lose by not,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Turyatunga takes a walkie-talkie when he ventures into the forest, now and then asking habituators if they have close and clear views of chimps. That\u2019s because chimps, even when habituated, are more likely to be seen up in the trees.",
      "\u201cYou listen for early morning calls when they are getting out of the nests. Then present yourself to the chimps \u2014 they see you are there, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep with them. If they move, follow them.\"",

      "\u201cWe believe there are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth, and the SMMA (Social Media Minimum Age) law carries some serious privacy and political expression issues for everyone on the internet,\u201d Reddit said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWhile we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren\u2019t,\u201d Reddit added.",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists in Britain say they have found the earliest known evidence of deliberate fire-making, dating to around 400,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.",
      "The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.",
      "The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.",
      "Researchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.",
      "That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.",
      "Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows \u201chow they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.\u201d",
      "Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.",
      "Deliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.",
      "At Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.",

      "Chris Stringer, a human evolution specialist at the Natural History Museum, said fossils from Britain and Spain suggest the inhabitants of Barnham were early Neanderthals whose cranial features and DNA point to growing cognitive and technological sophistication.",
      "Fire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.",
      "Archaeologists say the Barnham site fits a wider pattern across Britain and continental Europe between 500,000 and 400,000 years ago, when brain size in early humans began to approach modern levels and when evidence for increasingly complex behavior becomes more visible.",
      "Nick Ashton, curator of Paleolithic collections at the British Museum, described it as \u201cthe most exciting discovery of my long 40-year career.\"",
      "For archaeologists, the find helps address a long-standing question: When humans stopped relying on lightning strikes and wildfires and instead learned to create flame wherever and whenever they needed it.",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",
      "\u201cI set out with a heart for travel and a heart for helping people, and this has married the two,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSafari\u201d is Swahili for \u201cjourney,\u201d and almost all of the overland drives qualified. A trip of 100 miles (160 kilometers) could take most of the day, traversing two-lane highways clogged with slow-moving semitrailers or backroads whose gullies and piano-size potholes tested the brawny, seven-passenger Toyota Land Cruisers at every turn.",
      "In the wildlife areas, we rarely left the vehicles, save for photos at the equator and a brief stop to tiptoe across Kenya\u2019s southern border into Tanzania.",

An international team of scientists is working to perpetuate the species using sperm from the last male northern white, Sudan, who died in 2014, and a southern white rhino as surrogate mom.",
      "The conservancy has not lost a rhino to poachers since 2017. But much of the danger to Kenya\u2019s wildlife today arises from conflicts between the animals and the people who live on the land. Elephants trample crops, lions and leopards prey on livestock. Giraffe and other wild animals are sometimes poached for meat.",

      "Most of our accommodations in Kenya\u2019s wildlife reserves were run by Serena Hotels, an operator of luxury resorts and hotels in Africa and South Asia. Rooms or cabins had safari-themed touches. At a couple stops, cabins were built to look like tents, with canvas roofs, solid floors, electricity and hot showers. Breakfasts and dinners were buffet-style.",
      "The most memorable stay was at Kileleoni Mara Gateway House in the Masai region, a sprawling, comfortable home with five guest rooms and two cottages in a fenced compound. It was as if a Masai friend had invited us to stay at her country house, serving us meat and vegetable stews at a long table under the stars.

      "The Trump administration has announced an expansion of travel restrictions to include 20 more countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday it was expanding travel restrictions to an additional 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, doubling the number of nations affected by sweeping limits announced earlier this year on who can travel and emigrate to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.",
      "The move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.",
      "People who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.",
      "In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.",
      "At the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "On Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.",
      "An additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",
      "The restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.",
      "The Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had \u201cwidespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records\u201d that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.",
      "It also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a \u201cgeneral lack of stability and government control,\u201d which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.",
      "The Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.",
      "The news of the expanding travel ban is likely to face fierce opposition from critics who have argued that the administration is using national security concerns to collectively keep out people from a wide range of countries.",

That\u2019s a visa category specifically for Afghans who closely assisted the U.S. war effort at great risk to themselves.",
      "No One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. \u2014 after extensive vetting \u2014 also contributes to the country's security.",
      "\u201cThough intended to allow for review of inconsistent vetting processes, this policy change inadvertently restricts those who are among the most rigorously vetted in our history: the wartime allies targeted by the terrorists this proclamation seeks to address,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Countries that were newly placed on the list of banned or restricted countries said late Tuesday that they were evaluating the news. The government of the island nation of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea said it was treating the issue with the \u201cutmost seriousness and urgency\u201d and was reaching out to U.S. officials to clarify what the restrictions mean and address any problems.",

      "The Senate is taking final votes to pass an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is nearing final passage Wednesday of an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs while pressuring Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video of strikes on alleged drug boats in international water near Venezuela.",
      "The annual National Defense Authorization Act, which would raise troop pay by 3.8%, gained bipartisan backing as it moved through the Senate, and the White House has indicated that it is in line with President Donald Trump's national security priorities. However, the legislation, which ran over 3,000 pages, revealed some points of friction between Congress and the Pentagon as the Trump administration reorients its focus away from security in Europe and towards Central and South America.",
      "The bill pushes back on recent moves by the Pentagon. It demands more information on boat strikes in the Caribbean, requires that the U.S. keep its troop levels in Europe at current levels and sends some military aid to Ukraine.",
      "But overall, the bill represents a compromise between the parties. It implements many of Trump's executive orders and proposals on eliminating diversity and inclusion efforts in the military and grants emergency military powers at the U.S. border with Mexico. It also enhances congressional oversight of the Department of Defense and repeals several years-old war authorizations.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it was part of the \u201cinvestment that we need to be making to ensure that in a dangerous world we are prepared to defend America and American interests.\u201d",
      "Still, the sprawling bill faced objections from both Democratic and Republican leadership on the Senate Commerce Committee. That's because the legislation allows military aircraft to obtain a waiver to operate without broadcasting their precise location, as an Army helicopter had done before a midair collision with an airliner in Washington, D.C. in January that killed 67 people.",
      "\"The special carve-out was exactly what caused the January 29th crash that claimed 67 lives,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said at a news conference this week.",
      "Cruz said he was seeking a vote on bipartisan legislation in the next month that would require military aircraft to use a precise location sharing tool and improve coordination between commercial and military aircraft in busy areas.",
      "Republicans and Democrats agreed to language in the defense bill that threatens to withhold a quarter of Hegseth\u2019s travel budget until he provides unedited video of the strikes with the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services, as well as the orders authorizing them.",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill Tuesday ahead of the bill's passage to brief lawmakers on the U.S. military campaign in international water near Venezuela. The briefing elicited contrasting responses from many lawmakers, with Republicans largely backing the campaign and Democrats expressing concern about it and saying they had not received enough information.",
      "The committees are investigating a Sept. 2 strike \u2014 the first of the campaign \u2014 that killed two people who had survived an initial attack on their boat. The Navy admiral who ordered the \u201cdouble-tap\u201d strike, Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, was also appearing before the committees Wednesday in a classified briefing that will also include video of the strike in question.",

      "The Pentagon is also required, under the legislation, to keep at least 76,000 troops and major equipment stationed in Europe unless NATO allies are consulted and there is a determination that such a withdrawal is in U.S. interests. Around 80,000 to 100,000 U.S. troops are usually present on European soil. A similar requirement also keeps the number of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea at 28,500.",
      "Lawmakers are also pushing back on some Pentagon decisions by authorizing $400 million for each of the next two years to manufacture weapons to be sent to Ukraine.",
      "Trump and Hegseth have made it a priority to purge the military of material and programs that address diversity, anti-racism or gender issues, and the defense bill would codify many of those changes. It will repeal diversity, equity and inclusion offices and trainings, including the position of chief diversity officer. Those cuts would save the Pentagon about $40 million, according to the Republican-controlled House Armed Services Committee.",

      "The effort to find a man who walked onto Brown University\u2019s campus and shot nearly a dozen students in a crowded lecture hall has raised serious questions about the school\u2019s security systems and the urgency of the investigation itself",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The ongoing effort to find a man who walked onto Brown University \u2019s campus during a busy exam season and shot nearly a dozen students in a crowded lecture hall has raised questions about the school's security systems and the urgency of the investigation itself.",
      "A day after Saturday's mass shooting, officials said a person of interest taken into custody would be released without charges, leaving investigators with little actionable insight from the limited security video they had recovered and scrambling to develop new leads.",
      "Law enforcement officials were still doing the most basic investigative work two days after the shooting that killed two students and wounded nine, canvassing local residences and businesses for security camera footage and looking for physical evidence. That's left students and some Providence residents frustrated at gaps in the university\u2019s security and camera systems that helped allow the shooter to disappear.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re in such a surveillance state but that wasn\u2019t used correctly at all is just so deeply frustrating,\u201d said Li Ding, a student at the nearby Rhode Island School of Design who dances on a Brown University team.",
      "Ding is among hundreds of students who have signed a petition to increase security at school buildings, saying that officials need to do a better job keeping the campus secure against threats like active shooters.",
      "\u201cI think honestly, the students are doing a more effective job at taking care of each other than the police,\u201d Ding said.",
      "Kristy dosReis, chief public information officer for the Providence Police Department, said that at no point did the investigation stand down even after officials appeared to have a breakthrough in the case, detaining a Wisconsin man who they now believe was not involved.",
      "\u201cThe investigation continued as the scenes were still active. Nothing was cleared,\u201d said dosReis.",
      "Police and the FBI on Monday released new video and photographs of a man they believe carried out the attack. The man wore a mask in the footage captured before and after the attack.",
      "FBI Boston Special Agent in Charge Ted Docks said a $50,000 reward was being offered for information that would lead to the identification, arrest and conviction of the shooter.",
      "Docks described the investigation, including documenting the trajectory of bullets at the shooting scene, as \u201cpainstaking work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are asking the public to be patient as we continue to run down every lead so we can give victims, survivors, their families and all of you the answers you deserve,\u201d Docks told reporters.",
      "While Brown University is dotted with cameras, there were few in the Barus and Holley building, home of the engineering school that was targeted.",
      "\u201cReality is, it\u2019s an old building attached to a new one,\u201d Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha told reporters about the lack of cameras nearby.",
      "The lack of campus footage left police seeking tips from the public.",

      "Law enforcement experts say colleges are often at a disadvantage when responding to threats like an active shooter. Their security officers are typically less trained and paid less than in other law enforcement departments. They also don\u2019t always have close partnerships with better-resourced agencies.",
      "Often, funding for campus police departments is not a top priority, even for schools with ample resources, said Terrance Gainer, a former Illinois law enforcement official who later served as the U.S. Senate\u2019s sergeant-at-arms.",
      "\u201cThey just aren\u2019t as flush in law enforcement as you would think. They don\u2019t like a lot of uniformed presence, they don\u2019t like a lot of guns around,\u201d said Gainer, who is now a consultant. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Brown or someone else, a key question is, what type of relationship do they have with the local police department?\u201d",

      "Vallee had expected to be notified through the city\u2019s 311 app, but hadn\u2019t realized that Mayor Brett Smiley phased out the app in March. Smiley said his administration sent out multiple alerts the day of the shooting using the new 311 system and has continued to send them.",

      "The shop Souza manages, In The Pink, is a block from the engineering building. One of the shooting victims, Ella Cook, was a regular at the store, Souza said. Cook had come in a few days earlier and said her last final was Saturday.",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas has sued the utility company whose downed power lines sparked the largest wildfire in state history, a deadly blaze that destroyed homes and livestock and charred miles of landscape, causing more than $1 billion in damage.",
      "The lawsuit filed Tuesday by state Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses Southwestern Public Service Company, which operates in Texas as Xcel Energy, of negligence in its upkeep of aging utility poles. It seeks to recover economic damages incurred by the state and prevent the company from passing those costs on to customers.",
      "The Smokehouse Creek fire killed three people in 2024, burning through more than 1,500 square miles (3,885 square kilometers) in Texas before spilling into neighboring Oklahoma. Texas A&M Forest Service investigators determined it was ignited when a decayed utility pole snapped and fell, dropping Xcel power lines onto dry grass.",
      "The Minnesota-based company has acknowledged its equipment appeared to have sparked the wildfire. But the lawsuit claims the company had neglected to replace aging utility poles in the windswept Panhandle, some of which were nearly 100 years old and more than twice their typical lifespan of 40 years.",
      "\u201cXcel\u2019s blatant negligence killed three Texans and caused unfathomable destruction in the Texas Panhandle,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cThe company made false representations about its safety commitments and ignored warnings that its aging infrastructure needed immediate repair and to be updated.\u201d",

      "A federal judge in Washington says he's inclined to deny a preservationist group's request to temporarily halt President Donald Trump's ballroom project",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge said Tuesday he's leaning toward denying a preservationist group's request to temporarily halt President Donald Trump 's White House ballroom project, saying the organization failed to show that \u201cirreparable harm\u201d would be caused if the project moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said he could issue a final decision on the restraining order by Wednesday. But Leon said he plans to hold another hearing in January on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's request to pause the ballroom project until it goes through multiple independent reviews and wins approval from Congress.",
      "In the meantime, Leon warned the administration to not make decisions on underground work, such as the routing of plumbing and gas lines, that would dictate the scope of future ballroom construction above ground. If that were to happen, Leon said, \u201cthe court will address it, I assure you of that.\u201d",
      "Trump, speaking Tuesday night at a Hannukah event, thanked the judge for the \u201ccourage in making the proper decision.\u201d He also described the ballroom as costing $400 million, though its previously listed price tag was $300 million.",
      "Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the National Trust, said it remained \u201cfully committed to upholding the interests of the American people and advocating for compliance with the law, including review by the National Capital Planning Commission and an opportunity for the public to provide comment and shape the project.\"",
      "Trump went ahead with the ballroom construction before seeking input from a pair of federal review panels, the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts. Trump has stocked the planning commission with allies, including the chairman, Will Scharf, who recently said he expected to receive the ballroom plans sometime this month.",
      "Leon made a couple of references during the hearing to the administration having just two weeks to submit the plans. Adam Gustafson, the principal deputy assistant attorney general, said the administration had \u201cinitiated outreach\u201d to the panel to do just that, but no date had been set.",

      "On a recent December day, Mark Latino and a handful of his workers spun sheets of vinyl into tinsel for Christmas tree branches. They worked on a custom-made machine that\u2019s nearly a century old, churning out strands of bright silver tinsel along its 35-foot (10-meter) length.",
      "Latino is the CEO of Lee Display, a Fairfield, California-based company that his great-grandfather founded in 1902. Back then, it specialized in handmade velvet and silk flowers for hats. Now, it's one of the only companies in the United States that still makes artificial Christmas trees, producing around 10,000 each year.",
      "Tariffs shone a twinkling light this year on fake Christmas trees \u2014 and the extent to which America depends on other countries for its plastic fir trees.",
      "Prices for fake trees rose 10% to 15% this year due to the new import taxes, according to the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Tree sellers cut their orders and paid higher tariffs for the stock they brought in.",
      "Despite those issues, tree companies say they aren\u2019t likely to shift large-scale production back to the U.S. after decades in Asia. Fake trees are labor-intensive and require holiday lights and other components the U.S. doesn\u2019t make, said Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Co., which sells more than 1 million artificial trees each year.",
      "Americans are also very price-sensitive when it comes to holiday d\u00e9cor, Butler said.",

      "About 80% of the U.S. residents who put up a Christmas tree this year planned to use a fake one, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. That percentage has been unchanged for at least 15 years.",
      "Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of Balsam Brands, which sells hundreds of thousands of Balsam Hill trees each year, said Americans like to set up their trees on Thanksgiving and leave them up for weeks, which dries out fresh-cut trees. Others prefer fake trees because they\u2019re allergic to the mold spores on real trees, he said.",
      "Americans also like convenience; 80% of the fake trees sold each year have the lights already strung on them, Butler said.",
      "That preference is one reason artificial tree production shifted away from the U.S., first to Thailand in the early 1990s and to China about a decade later. Winding lights around the branches is time-consuming and tedious, Harman said.",
      "\u201cWhere are we going to get 15,000 people in America who want to string lights on Christmas trees?\u201d Harman said.",
      "It takes an hour or two to make an artificial Christmas tree, from molding and cutting the needles to tying branches together and attaching the lights, Butler said. Workers in China, where 90% of fake trees are made, are paid $1.50 to $2 per hour, he said.",
      "Harman said the workers who wrap the lights on Balsam Hill's trees are so efficient \u201cit's like watching an Olympian.\u201d",
      "One of Balsam Brands\u2019 Chinese partners employs 15,000 to 20,000 people; another in Indonesia has up to 10,000, he said. Many are seasonal workers, since orders for Christmas d\u00e9cor slow down between October and February.",
      "Balsam Brands, which is based in Redwood City, California, studied whether it could make faux trees in Ohio during the first Trump administration, when President Donald Trump threatened -\u2013 but eventually delayed \u2013- tariffs on imported Christmas d\u00e9cor, Harman said.",

Latino's son James, who leads business development and marketing, said the company didn\u2019t import lights or decorations from China this year and relied on items it already had in stock. It's getting low on lights, so next year it will have to pay more to import them, he said.",
      "Some artificial tree companies are branching out so they\u2019re less reliant on China. National Tree Co., which is based in Cranford, New Jersey, moved some manufacturing to Cambodia in 2024, and could source all its trees from outside China by next year if it wanted to, Butler said.",
      "But diversifying their suppliers didn't make those companies immune from the impact of tariffs either. In April, the Trump administration threatened a 49% tariff against products from Cambodia. That rate was eventually reduced to 19%. Tariffs on artificial trees from China also bounced around but now average 20%, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s top Cabinet officials overseeing national security are expected back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as questions mount over the swift escalation of U.S. military force and deadly boat strikes in international waters near Venezuela.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others are set to brief members of the House and the Senate amid congressional investigations into a military strike in September that killed two survivors of an initial attack on a boat allegedly carrying cocaine in the Caribbean. Lawmakers have been examining the Sept. 2 attack as they sift through the rationale for a broader U.S. military buildup in the region that increasingly appears pointed at Venezuela. On the eve of the briefings, the U.S. military said late Monday it attacked three more boats believed to have been smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing eight people.",
      "\u201cWe have thousands of troops and our largest aircraft carrier in the Caribbean \u2014 but zero, zero explanation for what Trump is trying to accomplish,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.",
      "The closed-door sessions come as the U.S. is building up warships, flying fighter jets near Venezuelan airspace and seizing an oil tanker as part of its campaign against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office. Trump's Republican administration has not sought any authorization from Congress for action against Venezuela. But lawmakers objecting to the military incursions are pushing war powers resolutions toward potential voting this week.",
      "It\u2019s all raising sharp questions that Hegseth and the others will be pressed to answer. The administration\u2019s go-it-alone approach without Congress, experts say, has led to problematic military actions, none more so than the strike that killed two people who had climbed on top of part of a boat that had been partially destroyed in an initial attack.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not a war against Venezuela, then we\u2019re using armed force against civilians who are just committing crimes,\u201d said John Yoo, a Berkeley Law professor who helped craft the President George W. Bush administration's legal arguments and justification for aggressive interrogation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cThen this question, this worry, becomes really pronounced. You know, you\u2019re shooting civilians. There\u2019s no military purpose for it.\"",
      "Yet for the first several months, Congress has received little more than a trickle of information about why or how the U.S. military was conducting a campaign that has destroyed more than 20 boats and killed at least 95 people. At times, lawmakers have learned of strikes from social media after the Pentagon posted videos of boats bursting into flames.",
      "Congress is now demanding \u2014 including with language included in an annual military policy bill \u2014 that the Pentagon release video of that initial operation to lawmakers.",
      "For some, the footage has become a case sample that demonstrates the flawed rationale behind the entire campaign.",
      "\u201cThe American public ought to see it. I think shooting unarmed people floundering in the water, clinging to wreckage, is not who we are as a people,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has been an outspoken critic of the campaign. He added that, \u201dYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re at war and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to give any kind of due process to anybody and blow up people without any kind of proof.\u2019\"",

      "Still, there are also many prominent Republicans who back the campaign. Sen. Jim Risch, the GOP chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, last week called the attacks \u201cabsolutely, totally, and 100% legal under U.S. law and international law\u201d and claimed that many American lives had been saved by making sure the drugs didn't reach the U.S.",
      "But as lawmakers have dug into the details of the Sept. 2 strike, inconsistencies have emerged in the Trump administration's explanation of the attack, which the Pentagon initially tried to dismiss as a \u201ccompletely false\u201d narrative.",
      "Trump has argued that the strike that killed survivors was justified because the people were trying to overturn the boat. Several GOP lawmakers have also put forward that argument, saying that it showed the two survivors were trying to stay in the fight, rather than surrender.",
      "However, Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, who ordered the second strike as he commanded the special forces soldiers conducting it, acknowledged in private briefings on Capitol Hill last week that although the two people had tried to overturn the boat, they were unlikely to succeed. That's according to several people who either were in the briefings or had knowledge of them and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them.",
      "The two people had climbed on top of the overturned boat, had not made any radio or cellphone calls for backup and were waving, Bradley told the lawmakers. The Navy admiral consulted with a military attorney, then ordered the second strike because it was believed that drugs were in the hull of the boat and the mission was to make sure they were destroyed.",
      "Experts say the strike seems to run counter to the Pentagon\u2019s own manual on the laws of war, which states that \u201corders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe boat was damaged, the boat was overturned, and the boat had no power,\u201d said Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cI really don\u2019t care if there was another boat coming to rescue them. They\u2019re shipwrecked.\u201d",
      "The argument at the heart of Trump's campaign \u2014 that drugs bound for the U.S. are the equivalent of an attack on American lives \u2014 has resulted in lawmakers trying to parse whether laws were violated and, more broadly, what Trump's goals are with Venezuela.",
      "Besides the briefings from Hegseth and Rubio on Tuesday, Bradley is also expected to appear for classified briefings with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he wants to \u201creally understand what action, what intelligence they were acting on and whether or not they follow the laws of war, the laws of the sea.\"",

      "JUNO BEACH, Fla. -- Two dozen Kemp's ridley sea turtles are rehabilitating in Florida after the frigid waters off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, left them struggling with frostbite, pneumonia and abrasions.",
      "The 24 endangered sea turtles arrived at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, on Dec. 9, thanks to the nonprofit organization LightHawk. Last year, the center welcomed another bunch of cold-stunned turtles that were released into the Atlantic months later.",
      "They are expected to remain at the facility until spring, when they'll be released into the Atlantic Ocean to make their way back to New England, said Heather Barron, chief science officer and veterinarian at Loggerhead.",
      "She said the turtles suffered from a conditioned called cold stunning, which requires treatment with antibiotics, fluids and nebulization.",
      "Cold stunning occurs in extremely frigid temperatures and causes the cold-blooded sea turtles to become lethargic and lose mobility, and Kemp's ridley, loggerhead and green sea turtles are typically affected.",
      "The turtles migrate north in the summer and many get stuck while heading south in the hooked peninsula of Cape Cod, according to a New England Aquarium fact sheet. As the ocean temperatures drop, the turtles become lethargic, emaciated and hypothermic. They begin washing ashore, where volunteers rescue them and take them to the sea turtle hospital.",
      "A number of turtles were sent to Florida to relieve overcrowding at the New England Aquarium, said Pam Bechtold Snyder, director of marketing and communications for the Boston facility. Most of those turtles were stranded during a strong westerly wind event on Nov. 28 and went through the triage process at the Boston facility, Snyder said.",
      "They were sent to Florida to make room for more turtles coming in from Cape Cod, she said. So far during the annual cold-stunning phenomenon that began on Nov. 7, they've treated 472 hypothermic turtles.",

      "A private equity firm owned by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is no longer backing Paramount\u2019s hostile acquisition bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, the firm confirmed Tuesday.",
      "Days after Warner agreed to be bought by Netflix in early December, Paramount launched a rival bid that seeks to bypass Warner's management and appeal directly to its shareholders with more money. Paramount is offering $30 per Warner share to Netflix\u2019s $27.75.",
      "Warner, one of the \u201cbig five\u201d Hollywood studios, owns Warner Bros. Pictures, HBO, the DC Comics universe and the Harry Potter franchise. Experts say its acquisition could supercharge the winning company and reshape the streaming wars, either by catapulting Netflix further ahead of top competitors or by cementing a new power player in Paramount.",

    "story": [
      "Norman Podhoretz, a leading neo-conservative and the former editor of Commentary magazine, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Norman Podhoretz, the boastful, hard-line editor and author whose books, essays and stewardship of Commentary magazine marked a political and deeply personal break from the left and made him a leader of the neo-conservative movement, has died. He was 95.",
      "Podhoretz died \u201cpeacefully and without pain\u201d Tuesday night, his son John Podhoretz confirmed in a statement on Commentary's website. His cause of death was not immediately released.",
      "\u201cHe was a man of great wit and a man of deep wisdom and he lived an astonishing and uniquely American life,\u201d John Podhoretz said.",
      "Norman Podhoretz was among the last of the so-called \u201cNew York intellectuals\u201d of the mid-20th century, a famously contentious circle that at various times included Norman Mailer, Hannah Arendt, Susan Sontag and Lionel Trilling. As a young man, Podhoretz longed to join them. In middle age, he departed. Like Irving Kristol, Gertrude Himmelfarb and other founding neo-conservatives, Podhoretz began turning from the liberal politics he shared with so many peers and helped reshape the national dialogue in the 1960s and after.",
      "The son of Jewish immigrants, Podhoretz was 30 when he was named editor-in-chief of Commentary in 1960, and years later transformed the once-liberal magazine into an essential forum for conservatives. Two future U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Jeane Kirkpatrick, received their appointments in part because of essays they published in Commentary that called for a more assertive foreign policy.",
      "Despised by former allies, Podhoretz found new friends all the way to the White House, from President Ronald Reagan, a reader of Commentary; to President George W. Bush, who in 2004 awarded Podhoretz the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, and praised him as a \"man of \u201cfierce intellect\u201d who never \u201ctailored his opinion to please others.\u201d",
      "Podhoretz, who stepped down as editor-in-chief in 1995, had long welcomed argument. The titles of his books were often direct and provocative: \"Making It,\" \"The Present Danger,\" \"World War IV,\" \"Ex-Friends: Falling Out with Allen Ginsberg, Lionel and Diana Trilling, Lillian Hellman, Hannah Arendt, and Norman Mailer.\" He pressed for confrontation everywhere from El Salvador to Iran, and even disparaged Reagan for talking to Soviet leaders, calling such actions \"the Reagan road to detente.\" For decades, he rejected criticism of Israel, once writing that \u201chostility toward Israel\u201d is not only rooted in antisemitism but a betrayal of \u201cthe virtues and values of Western civilization.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Podhoretz became a choice target for disparagement and creative license. New York Times reviewer Michiko Kakutani called \u201cWorld War IV\u201d an \u201cillogical screed based on cherry-picked facts and blustering assertions.\u201d Ginsberg, once a fellow student at Columbia University, would mock the heavy-set editor for having \u201ca great ridiculous fat-bellied mind which he pats too often.\u201d Joseph Heller used Podhoretz as the model for the crass Maxwell Lieberman in his novel \u201cGood as Gold.\u201d Woody Allen cited Podhoretz's magazine in \"Annie Hall,\" joking that Commentary and the leftist Dissent had merged and renamed themselves Dysentery.",
      "Podhoretz never doubted he would be famous. Born and raised in a working class neighborhood in Brooklyn, he would credit the adoration of his family with giving him a sense of destiny. By his own account, Podhoretz was \u201cthe smartest kid in the class,\u201d brash and competitive, a natural striver who believed that \"One of the longest journeys in the world is the journey from Brooklyn to Manhattan.\"",
      "He would indeed arrive in the great borough, and beyond, thriving as an English major at Columbia University, from which he graduated in 1950, and receiving a master's degree in England from Cambridge University. By his mid-20s, he was publishing reviews in all the best magazines, from The New Yorker to Partisan Review, and socializing with Mailer, Hellman and others.",
      "He was named associate editor of Commentary in 1956, and given the top job four years later. Around the same time, he married the writer and editor Midge Decter, another future neo-conservative, and remained with her until her death in 2022.",

      "In childhood, Norman Podhoretz\u2019s world was so liberal that he later claimed he never met a Republican until high school. When Podhoretz took over Commentary, founded in 1945 by the American Jewish Committee, the magazine was a small, anti-Communist publication. Podhoretz's initial goal was to move it to the left \u2014 he serialized Paul Goodman's \"Growing Up Absurd,\" published articles advocating unilateral disarmament \u2014 and make it more intellectual, with James Baldwin, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe among the contributors. Subscriptions increased dramatically.",
      "But signs of the conservative future also appeared, and of his own confusion over a world in transition. He was a prominent critic of Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and other Beat writers, dismissing the upstart movement in 1958 as a \u201crevolt of the spiritually underprivileged\u201d and branding Kerouac a \u201cknow-nothing.\" In a 1963 essay, Podhoretz admitted to being terrified of Black people as a child, agonized over \"his own twisted feelings,\" wondered whether he, or anyone, could change and concluded that \"the wholesale merging of the two races is the most desirable alternative for everyone concerned.\"",
      "\"Making It,\" released in 1967, was a final turning point. A blunt embrace of status seeking, the book was shunned and mocked by the audience Podhoretz cared about most: New York intellectuals. Podhoretz would look back on his early years and conclude that to advance in the world one had to make a \u201cbrutal bargain\u201d with the upper classes, in part by acknowledging they were the upper classes. Friends urged him not to publish \u201cMaking It,\u201d his agent wanted nothing to do with it and his original publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, refused to promote it (Podhoretz gave back his advance and switched to Random House). Even worse, he was no longer welcome at literary parties, a deep wound for an author who had confessed that \u201cat the precocious age of 35 I experienced an astonishing revelation: It is better to be a success than a failure.\"",
      "By the end of the decade, Podhoretz was sympathizing less with the young leftists of the 1960s than with the way of life they were opposing. Like other neo-conservatives, he remained supportive of Democrats into the 1970s, but allied himself with more traditional politicians such as Edmund Muskie rather than the anti-Vietnam War candidate George McGovern. He would accuse the left of hostility to Israel and tolerance of antisemitism at home, with Gore Vidal (who called Podhoretz a \u201cpublicist for Israel\u201d) a prime target. Echoing the opinions of Decter, he also rejected the feminist and gay rights movements as symptoms of a \"plague\" among \"the kind of women who do not wish to be women and among those men who do not wish to be men.\"",
      "\u201cTact is unknown to the Podhoretzes,\u201d Vidal wrote of Podhoretz and Decter in 1986. \u201cJoyously they revel in the politics of hate.\u201d",
      "Podhoretz was close to Moynihan, and he worked on the New York Democrat's successful Senate run in 1976, when in the primary Moynihan narrowly defeated the more liberal Bella Abzug. From 1981 to 1987, during the Reagan administration, Podhoretz served as an adviser to the United States Information Agency and helped write Kirkpatrick's widely quoted 1984 convention speech that chastised those who \"blame America first.\" He was a foreign policy adviser for Republican Rudolph Giuliani's brief presidential run in 2008 and, late in life, broke again with onetime allies when he differed with other conservatives and backed Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI began to be bothered by the hatred against Trump that was building up from my soon to be new set of ex-friends,\u201d he told the Claremont Review of Books in 2019. \u201cYou could think he was unfit for office \u2014 I could understand that \u2014 but my ex-friends\u2019 revulsion was always accompanied by attacks on the people who supported him. They called them dishonorable, or opportunists or cowards \u2014 and this was done by people like Bret Stephens, Bill Kristol, various others.",
      "\u201cAnd I took offense at that. So that inclined me to what I then became: anti-anti-Trump.\u201d",

      "\"I wasn't really that shy about including some of the bad stuff I did,\" Nick Reiner said during the joint interview, \"because a lot of people do things that are pretty unsavory when they're going through that, but in terms of making it a narrative, of course it's not my life.\" He also said, \"I think I can relate to it of course, and I hope other people can relate to it.\"",

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood stars and political leaders alike are paying homage to\u00a0Rob Reiner, the prolific movie director, actor and social activist whose shocking death has triggered a wave of heartfelt tributes online.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home in what police described as an apparent homicide. Police said Monday that their son Nick Reiner has been arrested\u00a0on murder charges.",
      "With a career that spanned multiple genres over more than five decades, Rob Reiner is considered a legend by many in the film and television industry. He rose to fame as a comedic actor in the CBS sitcom \"All in the Family,\" and his directing credits include classic titles like \"A Few Good Men,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\"",
      "Stephen King said he was \"horrified and saddened\" by the news of the Reiners' deaths in a post shared on X. Reiner's coming-of-age drama \"Stand by Me\" was based on King's novella \"The Body,\" and he also went on to direct the 1990 screen adaptation of the author's thriller \"Misery,\" both of which won acclaim.",
      "\"Wonderful friend, political ally, and brilliant filmmaker,\" King said. \"Rest in peace, Rob. You always stood by me.\"",
      "The actor and television host Jerry O'Connell, who was one of the young co-stars in \"Stand By Me,\" shared an photo on\u00a0Instagram\u00a0of himself and Reiner on the set of the 1986 movie. In its caption, he wrote: \"Love you Rob. Sincerely.\"",
      "In an interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" O'Connell described Reiner's death as \"surreal\" and reflected on the formative role that Reiner played in his life.",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" he said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. ... It's just a sad, shocking day.\"",
      "\"What a huge loss,\" wrote Ben Stiller, who said Reiner was one of his favorite directors and praised his \"incredible run of movies.\"",
      "\"He made some of the most formative movies for my generation,\" Stiller posted on X. \"'Spinal Tap' is one of the best  comedies ever made \u2014 and the list goes on. He was a kind caring person who was really really funny.    I didn't  know him well but was always a fan and I feel a real sadness for those who did, and his family.\"",
      "\"Thank you Rob for giving us so much joy to hold on to. Life and talent always turned up to 11,\" actor Virginia Madsen, who appeared in Reiner's 1996 film \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\"\u00a0wrote on Instagram.",
      "James Woods, who starred in the same film, said in a post on X\u00a0that Reiner had fought for him to play that part, and they \"remained good friends ever since.\"",
      "Actor Josh Gad called Reiner \"one of the greatest directors of our time.\" His Instagram post\u00a0included several photos of them together.",
      "\"He was a friend. He was simply a beautiful person,\" Gad captioned it. \"Rob Reiner and his wife Michelle were two of the most kind and caring souls you could ever imagine. He cared so much for those who had no voices. This loss is devastating. I cannot express how much this hurts. Love you Rob and Michelle. Thank you for all you gave us.\"",
      "Fellow director Joe Russo said he \"can't handle the truth that one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live is gone\" in\u00a0a post on X, referencing the iconic line from \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "\"We lost one of the few good men. RIP, Rob Reiner,\" Russo added.",
      "Actor and Screen Actors Guild president Sean Astin said in a news release that Reiner was \"one of those most significant figures in the history of film and television,\" whose cultural influence \"simply can't be overstated.\"",
      "\"All in the Family\" creator Norman Lear, who died in 2023 at age 101, \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary,\" Lear's family said in a statement. The family said they were \"devastated by the deaths of Rob and Michele Reiner.\"",
      "\"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends,\" the family said.",
      "Politicians from California and beyond have spoken out to express their condolences and celebrate Reiner's accomplishments in cinema as well as political activism. Reiner was a vocal advocate for Democratic campaigns and, in California, led initiatives for LGBTQ rights and early childhood development.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris said Reiner and his wife \"were dear friends,\" and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, \"are devastated to learn of their passing.\" Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, said Reiner's work \"has impacted generations of Americans.\"",
      "\"The characters, dialogue, and visuals he brought to life in film and television are woven throughout our culture,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X. \"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy.\"",
      "Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi, of California, described Reiner as \"creative, funny, and beloved\" and said in\u00a0a statement\u00a0that she and her family were mourning \"the loss of our very dear friends.\"",

    "summary": "Anthony Geary, who played Luke Spencer on the long-running soap opera \"General Hospital,\" has died.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros.

    "summary": "Enduring romances such as \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" made the British writer one of the brightest names in literature \u2013 and the beloved subject of a yearlong celebration marking the 250th anniversary of her birth.",
    "story": [
      "It might look like a scene from yet another Jane Austen production, but this is no set. The British town of Bath recently held a celebration of the author 250 years after her birth.",
      "This historic English town was channeling the early 1800s, the period when Austen's novels were published. \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" were among those Anne Perng grew up reading: \"The issues that she speaks of \u2013 the economy, class, family, sisters \u2013 still so resonate with us today.\"",
      "Fifteen thousand tickets were sold for this year's 10-day Jane Austen Festival, a level of enthusiasm that surprised even its organizer, Georgia Delve: \"Two of her novels are based here,\" she said. \"So, you can walk in her footsteps down the streets. You've got character names on streets, you've got places she visited. It's just the feeling of being in that world that she inhabited that makes it so special.\"",
      "Writer Devoney Looser said, \"She has written books that are endlessly re-readable.\"",
      "\"It's not enough to read it once?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I don't think so. There's something new to find every time.\"",
      "Looser's ties to the author are not just professional: \"My husband is also a Jane Austen scholar,\" she said. \"We met and had a fight over Jane Austen the day we met.\"",
      "\"What a love story!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, that's what he'd say, too!\"",
      "In her book, \"Wild for Austen,\" Looser argues the author is hardly plain, prim, and proper: \"It's there in her writings \u2013 this idea of women being positively wild. Unconventional, more free, more artless, and willing to combine feeling and thoughtfulness with intellectual ability. That this is the kind of thing she set out to celebrate in her heroines, at a time where women were supposed to be ideally passive and not very thinking.\"",
      "Austen died at age 41 after suffering a range of ailments. She wrote just six novels (two published after her death).",
      "Looser said, \"You can read her on the level of the word, the sentence, chapter, plot, character, and appreciate what she's done in terms of craft. And on top of that, they're funny and they're incredible works of social criticism.\"",
      "At the University of Southampton in England, scholars and enthusiasts met this past summer to discuss all things Austen.",
      "In the university's collections, among its seven million manuscripts and printed books, head of archives and special collections Karen Robson gave us a sampling from a first edition of Austen's \"Emma,\" printed in 1816:",
      "\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\"",
      "\"Lucky Emma,\" I said. \"You get so much in just this first sentence.\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Robson said. \"She's a wonderful wordsmith.\"",
      "Looser said, \"She publishes the first one, 'Sense and Sensibility,' 1811, as 'by a lady.' And then after that, as 'by the author of \"Sense and Sensibility.\"'\"",
      "\"She didn't put her name on the books? Why?\" I asked.",
      "\"Because novels in this period were not seen as high art. They were still seen as a kind of trashier genre,\" said Looser.",
      "\"So, she didn't want to be associated with it?\"",
      "\"She died before we know if she ever would have decided to put her name on something,\" she said.",
      "Looser likens Austen to Shakespeare, with the kind of staying power that takes form in the many films and miniseries based on her novels. Then, there are the Austen-inspired works, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club,\" and \"Clueless\" (based on \"Emma\").",
      "We visited the set of another spin-off, \"The Other Bennet Sister,\" based on Janice Hadlow's 2020 novel, which puts the often-overlooked middle sister, Mary, from \"Pride and Prejudice,\" at the center. \"I think she feels like a very modern heroine,\" said Jane Tranter, the executive producer of this BBC/Britbox series. \"It's not a classic boy-meets-girl kind of story.\"",
      "So, why do we see so many adaptations of Austen's work? \"Jane Austen is the absolute master of a love story, of a kind of slow-simmering, everything very proper, but kind of like boiling away beneath the lines of society,\" said Tranter. \"And we love that. And I think we love the period detail.\"",
      "That was clear in Bath, where the past was very much alive and celebrated on her 250th birthday.",
      "Asked why Austen's work endures, Looser replied, \"Because it's brilliant. Right? I mean, I think that's the glib, easy answer: because it's brilliant.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-makes-for-a-great-christmas-song/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Musicologist Joe Bennett explains the common components of the most enduring Christmas songs, from \"Jingle Bells\" to \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" \u2013 which inspires David Pogue to compose his own new holiday song.",
    "story": [
      "Every year at this time, some of the greatest songs in the world pop up in our playlists. Most of them are decades old, or even centuries. If anyone knows what makes a Christmas song immortal, it's Berklee School of Music forensic musicologist Joe Bennett. He's analyzed the holiday pop charts to learn exactly what makes popular Christmas songs popular \u2013 \"to try and figure out what are the musical characteristics that listeners keep coming back to again and again over the years,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Bennett found that most commercial Christmas hits are about one of only six things. Those thematic characteristics include \"home for the holidays\" (the most common one), weather-themed songs (like \"Let It Snow\"), the myth of Santa Claus, parties, being in love, and being out of love.",
      "Which brings us to the #1 Christmas hit of recent years: from 1994, Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Bennett says the song is remarkable because it hits most of the Christmas-themed tropes: \"We get Christmas presents, and the tree, and Santa Claus, and the snow. That lyric is so well-loved as a holiday celebration song, 'cause it's literally got it all.\"",
      "A few years back, \"Sunday Morning\" visited Walter Afanasieff, who wrote that song with Carey. \"Hey, I have a #1 hit every year, but it's the same song every year!\" he laughed.",
      "\"We just kind of, like, go bouncing off of each other, like at a jam session,\" he said. \"No one in a million years would've thought, 'Yeah, we're gonna release this and it's gonna be a big hit.'\"",
      "Musical elements",
      "And what does Maria Carey's hit have in common with most other Christmas hits? Sleigh bells! \"We found that more than 65% of the songs in the corpus had sleigh bells playing eight to the bar,\" said Bennett.",
      "He said the inspiration came from galloping horses: \"In the mid-1800s, the horses would actually wear sleigh bells to warn people that they were coming. So, you can imagine the sort of leather across the horse's mane there, and it's gonna make a heck of a noise \u2013 you're not gonna miss that deadly sleigh coming up behind you! You can imagine a horse trotting to that, and it's eighth notes. Da-da-da-da. Unwittingly pre-composing Christmas music from 100 years afterwards!\"",
      "Major Key",
      "Then there are the technical aspects of a piece of music, like the key. According to Bennett, about 98% of the songs in the data set that he looked at were in a major key. \"On a surface level, Christmas music tends to be cheerful,\" he said.",
      "\"The other characteristic that Christmas music has is, you want every generation to be able to sing it,\" he added. \"So that's why kids' songs are often very simple and go over smaller intervals\" \u2013 like \"Jingle Bells,\" which is comprised of five notes. \"And that's why kids find it easy to sing!\"",
      "And sure enough: Almost every popular Christmas song on Earth has an easily singable range of nine notes or fewer: Among them, \"White Christmas,\" \"12 Days of Christmas,\" \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" \"O Christmas Tree,\" \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts),\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \"Silver Bells,\" \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Little Drummer Boy,\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"",
      "Bennett points out one more common characteristic: a surprising number of Christmas melodies go right up or down the scale, as in \"Joy to the World,\" \"Let It Snow\" and 'Winter Wonderland.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think that so many Christmas songs wound up with these characteristics? It's not like the composer sat down and said, 'Four-four, major key, swing'?\"",
      "\"No, it's the selection effect \u2013 that is, we only know the Christmas songs that we know and love,\" Bennett said. \"We ignore the experimental ones that just died in the marketplace.\"",
      "A Christmas debut",
      "Now, based on the data I have studied on what makes a great Christmas song, I've written one \u2013 and Kerry Butler has gracefully agreed to sing it for us!",
      "Butler is a veteran of 12 Broadway shows, including \"Hairspray,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" She knows her way around a song \u2013 and the holidays hold a special meaning for her. \"My whole family is obsessed with Christmas,\" she said. \"We had our decorations up way before Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Asked what a Christmas song does for her emotionally that a pop song doesn't, Butler replied, \"I think it's the nostalgia. It brings back all these memories when we were little, singing them with our parents, and now we're older and we're singing them with our kids.\"",
      "Now, songwriter Walter Afanasieff and Joe Bennett both say that just including all the traditional musical ingredients doesn't automatically make a song great. \"It's not, like, a formula or an algorithm,\" said Afanasieff.",
      "And Bennett made an obvious point: \"If it were easy, a lot more people would be doing it!\"",
      "But, I had to give it a shot! And so, \"Sunday Morning\" presents the world premiere of \"The Sound of Christmas.\" It's got sleigh bells, in a major key, with a singable range, and a melody going down the scale.",
      "Crackling fires and crunching snow,Fa-la-la and ho-ho-ho!Listen! Oh, I love the sound ofChristmas!",
      "Caroling and jingle bells, \"Silent Nights\" and \"First Noels,\" All around,  I love the sound  Of Christmas",

      "Actor and comedic icon Dick Van Dyke is 100 years young today.",
      "The famed star sang and danced his way into America's heart through his illustrious career that has spanned nearly eight decades.",
      "As part of the celebration this weekend, theaters across the country are showing a new documentary about his life, \"Dick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration.\"",
      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I could have been James Bond. When Sean Connery left, the producer said, 'Would you like to be the next Bond?' I said, 'Have you heard my British accent?' Click! That's a true story!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023.",
      "During his career, Van Dyke won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and a Grammy Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995.",
      "Just last year, he became the oldest winner of a Daytime Emmy, for a guest role on the soap \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "\"I'll be darned. I think I'm the last of my generation. I'm 98. I have \u2014 almost \u2014 all my marbles. I can't remember what I had for breakfast,\" he told Entertainment Tonight before his win.",
      "Van Dyke, who is just an Oscar shy of the elusive EGOT title, said he would love a shot at the Academy Award.",
      "\"I hope it's not posthumous,\" he joked.",
      "In the 1970s, Van Dyke found sobriety after battling alcoholism.",
      "\"I'm on my third generation,\" he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023. \"I'm getting letters from little kids, and that is what I love, that they watch the movies over and over. I'm getting so much more mail today than I did during the heyday of my career.\"",
      "Now that he has hit triple digits, Van Dyke said he's gotten some perspective on how he used to play older characters.",
      "\"You know, I played old men a lot, and I always played them as angry and cantankerous,\" he told ABC News\u00a0ahead of his milestone birthday. \"It's not really that way. I don't know any other 100-year-olds, but I can speak for myself.\"",
      "He has long credited his wife, 54-year-old makeup artist and producer Arlene Silver, with keeping him young.",
      "\"As I've said, if I had known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning. \"Yeah, 'cause I went through that whole period of alcoholism. But my wife, God bless her, makes sure that I go to the gym three days a week and do a full workout.\"",
      "Van Dyke was born in West Plains, Missouri, in 1925, and grew up \"the class clown\" in Danville, Illinois, while admiring and imitating the silent film comedians.",
      "Five years ago, while celebrating getting a Kennedy Center Honor, Van Dyke told CBS Mornings that he was looking forward to hitting the 100-year-old mark.",
      "\"George Burns made it, and I'm gonna do it too,\" he said.",
      "And now, he told ABC News that he feels lucky about turning 100. But what's hard about being 100?",
      "\"I miss movement,\" he told the outlet. \"I've got one game leg from I don't know what.\"",
      "\"I still try to dance,\" he said with a laugh.",

      "An urgent advisory warning people against eating foraged mushrooms was issued by the California Department of Public Health on Friday due to recent amatoxin poisonings.",
      "As of Friday, there were 21 poisonings confirmed by the California Poison Control System linked to eating wild, foraged mushrooms, such as death caps, the CDPH said.",
      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",
      "They can typically be found near oaks and other hardwood trees, including pine trees, and are easily mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms. But neither cooking, boiling, drying or freezing them will render them safe to eat, the CDPH said.",
      "Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration can begin between six to 24 hours after eating one, and it's possible symptoms will go away after a day, but the CDPH warns the recovery is \"deceptive.\"",
      "\"Patients may still develop serious to fatal liver damage within 48 to 96 hours after eating the mushrooms,\" the CDPH said.",
      "\"Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season,\" said Dr. Erica Pan, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

      "A robocall scam is targeting hundreds of thousands of consumers each week, with fraudsters impersonating employees of Walmart in an effort to obtain people's personal information, according to a telecommunications security company and the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "Targets of the scheme receive a call from someone claiming to be from Walmart asking if they have authorized the purchase of a PlayStation 5 video game console and accompanying 3D headset. The person is then invited to \"cancel\" the order by connecting with a live customer service representative, who asks for credit card, Social Security number and other personal data.",
      "YouMail, which makes technology to block robocalls and scam texts, has been tracking calls associated with the so-called phishing campaign in cooperation with the FCC.",
      "\"It's too easy to get tricked when you feel pressure to act right away to address a problem that might cost you money,\" YouMail CEO Alex Quilici told CBS News in an email, noting that the scam targets tens of millions of U.S. consumers.",

      "\"Hi, this is [NAME] from Walmart, and this is not a telemarketing call. We have detected a pre-authorized purchase of $919.45 for a PlayStation 5 and 3D headset, recently placed through a Walmart account registered to your name and phone number. If you did not authorize this purchase, press 1 to speak with a Walmart representative immediately.\"",
      "According to YouMail data, the bad actors have used more than 50 aliases as part of the ongoing robocall scam. They relied mainly on male names like David, Brandon, Michael and Paul earlier in the campaign, before swapping them for more female aliases in the second half of this year, such as Olivia, Jessica and Naomi.",
      "The scam first surfaced as early as 2023, and Quilici said it has expanded since then. \"Most campaigns start at low volume before they ramp,\" he said.",

      "The scammers are targeting Walmart because it is a trusted brand with a huge customer base, according to Iskander Sanchez-Rola, director of AI and innovation for Norton, a cybersecurity company.",
      "\"Walmart shoppers may also be more vulnerable, since many are budget-conscious and quick to react to unexpected charges, especially when the scam uses realistic AI-generated voices that sound similar to the automated calls they already receive from the retailer,\" he said in an email to CBS News.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 08:32:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, its highest level since September 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as new October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:25:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads, which would create the first U.S. transcontinental railroad, has lost the support of two major unions.",
    "story": [
      "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half their workers because they're worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision, which they plan to announce Wednesday, will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups, and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Trump.",
      "The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Unions finding fault",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and that it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives, they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs of all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\"This proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between 'Hell or the highway.'\"",
      "The unions say they're worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides in the two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they're optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Over 99% of shareholders of both lines voted in favor of the combination last month.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago, it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Outside views mixed",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",
      "Currently, Norfolk Southern and CSX serve the eastern U.S. while Union Pacific and BNSF serve the west, and the two major Canadian rails compete where they can with their tracks crossing Canada and extending down into the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"This merger is like nothing we've seen before. It's creating a railroad of such enormous scope that it's somewhat of a paradigm shift,\" Schwieterman said.",
      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",
      "\"No customer is asking for this. This is strictly a Wall Street play for shareholders,\" Andersen said.",
      "Earlier this fall, Buffett and CPKC's CEO both said they weren't interested in any kind of rail merger right now. Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

    "story": [
      "Newly released financial documents and photos obtained from the estate of convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0are reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The photos, released Dec. 12 by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, include images of prominent figures such as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Earlier in the month, the same committee had released financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as photos and videos of the financier's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018.",
      "Separately from the Oversight Committee's document release, Congress has passed a bill last month giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. President Trump signed the bill into law on Nov. 19.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has proved politically sensitive\u00a0after Mr. Trump returned to office in January of 2025. The president had earlier urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue, initially describing the effort to release more records as a distraction tactic, but reversed his stance in November.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has been accused of no wrongdoing, had been friends with Epstein but later cut his ties with the businessman.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank in 2023 for a reported $290 million. The money was slated to go to almost 200 Epstein victims, according to the New York Times.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "In October, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, pointed to\u00a0$1.5 billion in suspicious financial transactions that had been flagged by the banks and were tied to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking crimes. The same month, Bank of America was sued by one of Epstein's victims, who alleged the bank facilitated and also benefited from his alleged crimes.",
      "Bank of America had no comment on the lawsuit.",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",

    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

And at a Target store in Arkansas, single-serve packs of ByHeart formula were promoted with a \"Sale!\" sign and a $2 discount from Nov. 16 to Nov. 22.",
      "Information from state and local health officials said ByHeart formula was found at Walmart stores in 21 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 26. The formula was found in Albertsons stores in 11 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19, and at Kroger stores in 10 states from Nov. 12 to Nov. 19.",
      "In addition, the companies failed to provide FDA with evidence that corrective actions have been put in place, despite multiple requests, the agency said. The companies have 15 working days to respond to the letters.",
      "Walmart officials said in a statement that no ByHeart formula was sold after cash registers were blocked from selling the formula following the recall.",
      "\"We moved swiftly to issue a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores and clubs and online,\" a company spokesperson said in an email. \"We take all reports of inaction seriously and will respond to the letter.\"",

      "\"ByHeart infant formula products have been removed from our store shelves,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Target and Kroger for comment.",
      "The FDA says it hasn't received reports of recalled formula being found on store shelves since Nov.\u00a026, 2025.",
      "All babies in the outbreak have been hospitalized and treated with an IV medication to stop the progress of the disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the outbreak to include all babies treated for botulism after consuming ByHeart formula since it was first produced in 2023.",
      "Steven Mandernach, executive director at the Association of Food and Drug Officials, said the FDA itself was slow to distribute information about the recall with state and local food safety officials. The agency didn't fully share product lists until Nov. 14, nearly a week after the initial recall of two lots of ByHeart formula on Nov. 8.",
      "He said it was \"disappointing\" in an outbreak involving the sole source of nutrition for vulnerable infants.",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James accused UPS of violating labor laws by using unlawful timekeeping practices to underpay seasonal help.",
      "\"UPS built its holiday business on the backs of workers who were not paid for their time and labor,\" James\u00a0said in a statement announcing the charges. \"UPS's seasonal employees work brutal hours in the cold to deliver the holiday packages families across the country count on. Instead of compensating these workers fairly for their labor, UPS has played the Grinch.\"",
      "UPS denied the allegations that it intentionally underpaid workers.",
      "\"We offer industry-leading pay and benefits to our more than 26,000 employees in New York, and we remain committed to following all applicable laws,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "James said Monday that Atlanta-based UPS, which employs nearly 500,000 people worldwide and generated more than $90 billion in revenue last year, stole wages from seasonal workers, including \"Driver Helpers\" and \"Seasonal Support Drivers\" who assist full-time staff with package delivery around the holidays.",
      "UPS allegedly failed to pay seasonal workers for all of the hours they worked, according to the civil lawsuit, which was filed in New York state court. For example, UPS delayed worker clock-ins until they scanned in a package or made a delivery, even if they had been scheduled to start working hours earlier, the complaint alleges. UPS also automatically deducted 30-minute meal breaks regardless of whether workers took them, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The suit seeks back pay for UPS workers in New York, as well as a court order requiring the company to end off-the-clock work and to overhaul its timekeeping and payroll practices.",

      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros.

      "'Tis the season for holiday gift guides. You know, the ones that suggest 31 fish gifts for your fish-obsessed friends. They're everywhere this time of year, though nowhere quite as surprising as a seemingly run-of-the-mill office in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I will candidly admit that when we started this a dozen years ago, I thought it was a fun thing to do,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade advocacy and lobbying group that works to strengthen manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's just a break from talking about tariffs and policy and regulation. And so, the gift guide was kind of like a whimsical thing. It's grown into something much larger than that.\"",

      "And it's a very big deal for the companies included. \"It can be very uplifting to some of these companies, because some are like, how did you find us?\" Paul laughed.",
      "As a proud Marylander, Shelby Blondell dreamed of a better way to dig into the state's official unofficial cuisine. The result? The Sheller. Her small business, in a quiet Baltimore suburb, is a labor of love that is keeping manufacturing close to home.",
      "\"All along, I even had a lot of people when I was, you know, creating it saying like, 'You should just be making this overseas, you'll make so much more money,'\" Blondell said. \"And money's great. We need money to live. But you know, the cost of what that would've been didn't seem to outweigh kind of that value in my mind of wanting to have this be made here.\"",
      "Value like partnering with a local fabricator that uses American steel, which means the Sheller has avoided the sting of recent tariffs. \"If I would've been hit with tariffs of making this overseas somewhere right now, I don't know that I could still be in business,\" Blondell said.",
      "This gift guide knows that your pets, of course, deserve stocking stuffers as well, and it suggests\u00a0Cycle Dog\u00a0in Portland, Oregon. For 16 years, founder Lynette Fidrych and her team have been recycling bicycle tire inner tubes to make leashes and collars. And yes, this collar does have a bottle opener. \"Portland is known for biking, beer, sustainability, and dogs,\" Fidrych laughed.",
      "A former Nike employee, Fidrych now employs about 30 workers at her Portland factory. \"Made in America\" means higher labor cost, and sometimes higher price tags. But to her, it also means higher quality. \"We make a product and we put it in the dog run and have a hundred dogs play with it,\" she said. \"And so, when we sell this toy, we're like, yeah, it's gonna last.",
      "\"Most people assume that plush toys are made in China, even my retailers,\" she said. \"And I'm like, 'No, we hand-make these here in the U.S. There's a flag on the tag.\"",
      "Meanwhile, back in D.C., Scott Paul is actually pretty easy to shop for: his shirt, made in New Jersey; his belt, made out of American leather; his shoes, from Meridian, Mississippi.",
      "For those of us still scrambling for a last-minute gift, Paul says to look close to home, and to start with the guide that brings not just holiday cheer, but maybe a little American pride.",
      "\"No one needs to say, 'Everything I have to own or buy has to be made in the United States'; that doesn't do anybody any favors, and it's really hard to pull off,\" he said. However, \"If you can't find one thing that looks really cool and is also affordable on our gift guide, I would be shocked. Try it once, the odds are you're gonna come back and want more.\"",

    "summary": "In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans were laid off from their jobs, the most since the COVID pandemic, even as corporate profits remain high. Business experts discuss the reasons why companies resort to layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "For the last few weeks, Heidi Roberts' full-time job has been trying to find one. \"I literally apply at jobs from 8:00 a.m. 'til five o'clock every day,\" she said. \"And I think I've done about 56 to 60 jobs already. And I've only had seven callbacks. So, it's just been really disheartening.\"",
      "She's been at it every day since October, when she was laid off from a financial company in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "She said she didn't see it coming: \"I had no idea, none at all,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be me. It's just hard getting up in the morning sometimes, 'cause you really gotta pump yourself up to do it. And I keep thinking, 'Okay, this next interview, hopefully it's gonna go well.'\"",
      "Roberts' Christmas wish is not unusual this year. In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans have been laid off, the most since the 2020 COVID pandemic (according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas). The layoffs have hit numerous industries and companies of all sizes (including our own parent company, Paramount Skydance). The largest cuts came from the federal government (followed by technology, warehouses and retail), with tens of thousands of cuts each.",
      "\"Those are numbers that we haven't seen outside of recessionary periods like COVID or the Great Recession in 2008,\" said Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks the job market. \"It is a concerning stat, and everybody in the world is really paying close attention to it.\"",
      "Asked why so many companies today are almost simultaneously cutting down on the number of workers, Challenger replied, \"I'd say there's a couple stories that are going on simultaneously. One is that companies really over-hired in 2022 and 2023; we're seeing some economic headwinds, increased prices. And then the third piece is, we've really started to see companies discuss artificial intelligence as a reason why they're conducting job cuts at their companies.\"",
      "Layoffs \"perceived positively by the markets\"",
      "In the past companies laid off workers during periods of struggle. But Annie Lowrey, a staff writer with The Atlantic, says that's not what is happening now: \"Corporate profits are very, very high,\" she said. \"And if you look actually at businesses at how much their CEOs are making, it's just an enormous, enormous share. And I think that it reflects this divergence between the 1% and the 99%.\"",
      "Lowrey says most layoffs aren't happening because companies are in the red, but because the future of the economy looks a bit gray: \"Business leaders often like to blame uncertainty stemming from Washington. In this case, I think that they might actually really have a case. That might be the tariffs and the trade war, that might be the high cost of borrowing even if interest rates are coming down. Again, none of these in and of itself is enough to tip the massive and still quite vibrant American economy into a recession. But it's really leading to a pause that I think has now led to a freeze on hiring, and is now leading to more companies choosing to lay workers off.\"",
      "And then there's the question about the impact of artificial intelligence. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI already has the ability to replace nearly 12% of the labor market.",
      "\"The reality is, the tech is there; implementing and the practical application of that technology is still a ways away,\" said Jason Leverant, president of the national staffing company AtWork. He says when it comes to AI, at this point it's about keeping shareholders happy.",
      "\"If I'm a publicly traded firm, or otherwise, and I want to be perceived as forward thinking, I'm adopting cutting edge technology \u2013 'Hey, we're leveraging AI, we're cutting expenses, we're cutting our overhead \u2026 unfortunately, that has to deal with layoffs,'\" Leverant said. \"That sells really well. It's really, unfortunately, perceived positively by the markets.\"",
      "But while AI gets a lot of attention, the fact is it ranks sixth in reasons for layoffs, behind the overall economy and restructuring.",
      "\"It's a failure of your business model\"",
      "For more than 50 years, Bob Chapman has been at the helm of Barry-Wehmiller, a global supplier of manufacturing technology. Founded in 1885, the company now makes nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, and has 12,000 employees.",
      "Asked his response to companies who says their layoffs are necessary, Chapman replied, \"First of all, I'd say in general, it's a failure of leadership. If your business model fails, your market changes, the challenges change, and you don't adapt to it or anticipate it, you're gonna hurt people, okay? So, it's a failure of your business model.\"",
      "Chapman says layoffs should only be a last resort: \"We dehumanize this by calling it layoffs, right-sizing, downsizing. We're actually destroying people's lives.\"",
      "I asked, \"But why should you, as a CEO, concern yourself with what happens beyond the walls of this plant?\"",
      "\"Because I care about people, okay?\" Chapman replied. \"How can you run a company and not care about the people that are put in your span of care? And when you treat them as functions, you're saying they don't matter, it's just an economic transaction. And it is not just an economic transaction.\"",
      "And last week, more news, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lowering interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, motivated by a vulnerable job market. Powell said, \"Gradual cooling of the labor market has continued. Unemployment is up three tenths.\"",
      "Instead of adding jobs, Powell says we could be losing as many as 20,000 each month. This all has many Americans feeling less than jolly this holiday season, with layoffs expected to continue into the New Year.",
      "But back in Knoxville, some good news. A few days ago, shortly after our visit, Heidi Roberts received the #1 item on her Christmas list: a new job. \"I start January the 5th,\" she said. \"So, New Year, new me, so I'm excited!\"",
      "It meant a pay cut, but she says these days any job feels like a gift.",
      "With many Americans still looking for work, what would she say to those folks now? \"I would say, keep on moving. Keep on pushing, do not give up, and just believe,\" Roberts said. \"You will find the company. Just keep on believing, and pray. I'm very blessed.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in New York moved Tuesday to drop charges against Hernan Lopez, a former Fox employee who was convicted of participating in a scheme\u00a0to bribe FIFA officials to secure broadcasting rights to the World Cup and other top soccer matches, as well as the company involved in the scandal.",
      "The move would end a yearslong legal battle by past Justice Departments to preserve the convictions, which are currently caught in a slate of appeals.",
      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",
      "CBS News has attempted to reach Lopez's representatives. Lawyers for Full Play Group declined to comment.",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of the story incorrectly described the charges against Lopez and misstated the year he was convicted.",

    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",
      "Boeing and Delta both declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In September, Delta said it would replace auxiliary power units, a type of engine, on 300 of its Airbus A320 aircraft to address toxic fume incidents.",

    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "Gas",
      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",
      "The decline is due to strong refinery output and lower crude oil prices, as well as to softer seasonal fuel demand, GasBuddy has said.",
      "Yet while fuel prices have dropped, other energy costs have increased. Residential electricity prices around the U.S. rose more than 10% over the first eight months of 2025, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an educational and policy organization. By comparison, power costs rose roughly 6% over the trailing 12 months.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 U.S. households was seriously behind on their utility bills, according to a report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. Over the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the groups found.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department is suing more than a dozen landlords on allegations of sexual harassment, a problem one top department official called \"traumatic for the victims\" and \"inappropriate and illegal.\"",
    "story": [
      "In a crowded neighborhood of duplexes, small apartments and one-story bungalows near a liquor store and pizza shop, William Asper serves as a landlord for nearly two dozen properties.",
      "The Detroit suburb of Westland, Michigan, 10 minutes north of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, is where Asper helps manage some weathered rental properties, many of which were built in the early 1970s and are more affordable to low-income families in this working-class region, according to federal records published by the Justice Department.",
      "Amid surging housing costs, rent in the neighborhood is more affordable, including for families who use federal subsidies and have no other options for housing.",
      "The Justice Department has alleged Asper tried to take advantage of the needs of his tenants, leveraging his position to seek sexual favors. The agency said Asper threatened to withhold repairs or evict tenants who did not comply.",
      "In a court filing in Michigan earlier this month, the Justice Department alleged Asper told one tenant in 2019 \"that there were 'different ways' she could pay rent.\" The government's attorneys also said he \"touched the tenant without her consent, regularly pulling her hair, grabbing her buttocks and kissing her head.\" And they alleged he \"regularly pulled his penis out of his pants in front of the tenant while at her home, often times while her young son was in the room.\"",
      "In their court documents, Justice Department lawyers also alleged that in 2018, Asper told a \"female tenant that he was lonely, wanted someone to spend time with him, and asked if she would go to a hotel with him. Asper allegedly \"told the female tenant that if she did not engage in sexual relations with him, he would give her a 24-hour eviction notice.\"",
      "The allegations appeared in a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Asper, arguing he violated the federal Fair Housing Act. His civil case is pending in the Eastern District of Michigan federal court, and his formal response to the allegations has not yet been posted.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Asper said the accusations are false.",
      "\"I offer low-income housing and people want to blame the landlord or make excuses why they couldn't pay the rent,\" Asper said. \"These women wanted to do more/be my 'girlfriend', side chick and that was not going to happen.\"",
      "Asper isn't the only landlord facing such claims. It is one of at least 52 federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and misconduct against landlords since 2017.",
      "\"It's traumatic for the victims,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. \"People may not believe them. And they may have been the victim multiple times.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which seeks to combat these types of cases, was launched in the first year of the first Trump administration in 2017. Dhillon's team continues to pursue the cases. Several former Justice Department attorneys, including appointees of both the Biden and Trump Administrations, have lauded the program and its work since 2017.",
      "There are 14 federal sexual harassment civil cases pending across the United States, including Asper's case in Michigan.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Dhillon said the filings of these suits can serve as a deterrent to future harassment and abuse. She said the legal challenges \"made all the women in that property feel like they've been seen and heard.\"",
      "Dhillon said the Fair Housing Act, which passed in 1968 amid the sweeping changes of the Civil Rights era, prohibits any kind of quid pro quo involving sex, sexual acts or sexual harassment, either for renting, continuing to rent or obtaining repairs.",
      "\"Every American deserves to feel safe and know this sexual harassment is inappropriate and illegal,\" Dhillon said.",
      "A CBS News review of some of the dozens of recently filed Justice Department cases shows parallels to the accusations against Asper.",
      "In a separate legal challenge filed against a central New York landlord in 2018, the Justice Department alleged the harassment spanned three decades. The Oswego man is accused of \"Demanding that female tenants engage in, or pressuring them to engage in, sexual intercourse, oral sex, or other sexual acts with him in order to obtain or keep rental housing.\"",
      "In a 2017 Justice Department complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, a Wichita-area landlord is accused of entering a female tenant's apartment \"unannounced\" and \"touching her body while she slept in her bed.\" The landlord is also accused of \"Conditioning tangible housing benefits, including forgiving or reducing rent, on engaging in sexual conduct.\"",
      "And in a legal challenge initially filed in Minnesota in 2020, the feds alleged a landlord offered to overlook or excuse unpaid rent and utilities in exchange for sex acts. The landlord was also accused of \"Expressing a preference for renting to single female tenants.\"",
      "The legal challenges filed by the Justice Department can help secure civil penalties against landlords and damages for victims. A CBS News review of Justice Department records showed the agency has recovered approximately $1.5 million since January.",
      "And in the New York, Kansas and Minnesota cases, the Justice Department struck written agreements with the landlords that, among other things, required them to hire independent property managers so they would no longer need to come into contact with tenants themselves.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Fair Housing Alliance, a civil rights group that advocates for tenants and combats discrimination, said instances of sexual harassment by landlords are likely more pervasive than current statistics indicate.",
      "\"Sexual harassment in housing is one of the most underreported instances of housing discrimination, given that the victims often fear facing retaliation or eviction if they file a complaint,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which handles Fair Housing Act sex harassment probes, has experienced a purge of veteran employees this year, amid a Trump-ordered downsizing of the federal government \u2014 led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 and the Trump Administration's dramatic shifts in some of the office's priorities.",
      "Justice Connection, a newly formed organization that supports ousted or resigning Justice Department prosecutors, estimated nearly 75% of career attorneys in the division have departed this year.",
      "Dhillon said the unit that handles the housing cases has been less impacted by the changes and cuts. She told CBS News, \"I don't think we're losing people in that section, and people are pretty happy with the type of work we're doing.\" Dhillon said the Civil Rights section has hired approximately 50 people this year, amid the larger turnover in the agency.",
      "Some tenants have filed their own individual federal civil lawsuits alleging sex harassment in violation of the Fair Housing Act.",
      "In one case, an Alabama woman filed a complaint in federal court alleging a series of personal harms. Her suit alleged \"emotional distress, including humiliation and mental anguish\" from a landlord who \"offered to reduce her rent in exchange for sex.\" The lawsuit alleged: \"When [she] refused his sexual advances, he raised her rent.\"",
      "Housing advocates said low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to harassment, under fear that they could lose their housing if they reject a landlord's unlawful advances.",
      "The Justice Department's posted guidance on its protections of the Fair Housing Act says that \"women, particularly those who are poor, and with limited housing options, often have little recourse but to tolerate the humiliation and degradation of sexual harassment or risk having their families and themselves removed from their homes. The Department's enforcement program is aimed at landlords who create an untenable living environment by demanding sexual favors from tenants or by creating a sexually hostile environment for them.\"",
      "The National Fair Housing Alliance spokesperson told CBS News: \"Each investigation\u2014and especially every resolution\u2014sends a clear message that this egregious conduct, which targets the most vulnerable, will not be tolerated. Home should be a safe place, and these actions ensure that promise is upheld.\""

    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on a violent Mexican fuel-theft cartel and its imprisoned leader, amid the Trump administration's crackdown on cartels backing operations through stolen oil and gas.",
      "The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control designated the Guanajuato-based group known as the \"Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima,\" or CSRL, after U.S. officials found the enterprise turned a profit by stealing fuel and crude oil from Mexico's state-owned energy company, Pemex.",
      "OFAC also sanctioned Jose Antonio Yepez Ortiz. Dubbed \"El Marro,\" or \"the sledgehammer,\" the leader of CSRL is currently serving out a 60-year sentence in Mexico, but U.S. officials have accused him of orchestrating cartel operations from behind bars by \"sending instructions and orders to his collaborators through his lawyers and family members.\"",
      "Fuel theft \u2014 more commonly known as huachicol in Mexico \u2014 has risen to the second most profitable revenue stream for Mexican cartels behind drug trafficking, according to the U.S. Treasury. U.S. officials allege that members of CSRL steal fuel and crude oil from Pemex by bribing insiders, tapping pipelines, siphoning refineries, hijacking tanker trucks, and intimidating employees.",
      "The stolen fuel is then sold across Mexico, the United States and Central America, while crude oil is smuggled north via complicit brokers \u2014 frequently disguised as \"waste oil\" to evade taxes and environmental scrutiny, the U.S. Treasury discovered. Once inside the United States, the oil is then funneled to unscrupulous importers along the southwest border, sold at deep discounts on U.S. and global markets with proceeds quietly funneled back to the cartels \u2014 fueling corruption, violence and a sprawling cross-border energy black market.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday's action is part of President Trump's pledge to \"eliminate\" cartels by cutting them off from the U.S. financial system, regardless of how they generate or launder money.",
      "CSRL, founded around 2014 and named after a community within Guanajuato, has been locked in a bloody turf war with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) since 2017 over control of fuel theft in a pipeline-dense region known as the \"Bermuda Triangle.\" The Treasury says that conflict has helped make Guanajuato one of Mexico's deadliest states. As recently as August, Mexican authorities seized more than 164,000 liters of stolen hydrocarbons linked to the group.",
      "U.S. officials say CSRL has allied with the Gulf Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel and has recruited former Colombian military and paramilitary members. The group is also accused of trafficking narcotics \u2014 including heroin \u2014 into the United States.",
      "Tuesday's sanctions freeze any U.S.-based assets belonging to CSRL and Yepez Ortiz, formally barring Americans from doing business with them and imposing possible civil or criminal penalties against violators.",
      "The decision follows earlier steps by the Trump administration to designate CJNG as a foreign terrorist organization and target affiliated fuel-theft networks tied to the criminal enterprise.",
      "After a May alert from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury says banks reported more than $827 million in suspicious oil-smuggling transactions underscoring the scope of the black market. According to FinCEN's analysis \u2014 and removing outliers \u2014 the average oil smuggling transaction is priced at $5 million, with suspicious activity reports frequently filed in Florida and Texas, including towns near the U.S.-Mexico border like Brownsville, Mission and Eagle Pass.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday designated another Latin American drug cartel as a foreign terrorist organization, increasing financial pressure on its members and opening the door to potential military action against them.",
      "The U.S. State Department said Clan del Golfo, which is based in Colombia, has been listed both as a foreign and a global terrorist group, calling it a \"violent and powerful criminal organization\" that uses cocaine trafficking to fund violent activities.",
      "\"Clan del Golfo is responsible for terrorist attacks against public officials, law enforcement and military personnel, and civilians in Colombia,\" the statement said.",
      "The designation comes after the Trump administration in September added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in almost 30 years. It was a stinging rebuke to a traditional U.S. ally that reflects a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and the country's leftist president, Gustavo Petro.",
      "The United States also sanctioned Petro in October over accusations that he had allowed drug cartels in the South American nation to \"flourish\" and export cocaine to the U.S. \u2014 accusations that he vehemently denied, arguing that Colombia is intercepting record levels of cocaine shipments without killing suspected smugglers.",
      "With an estimated 9,000 fighters, Clan del Golfo is one of Colombia's most powerful armed groups. Also known by its Spanish acronym AGC, the group evolved from right-wing paramilitary squads that fought Marxist guerillas in Colombia in the 1990s and 2000s.",
      "A report published last year by the Human Rights Defender's Office, a public agency, said that AGC is present in about a third of Colombia's 1,103 municipalities, where it extorts local businesses and has also been accused of recruiting children. The cartel has been accused of paying some recruits $3,500 for \"dead police officers.\"",
      "In May, Colombian authorities said they captured more than 200 members of the cartel, which had been accused of murdering two dozen security force members in the previous month.",
      "In April, eight \u00a0Clan del Golfo members were killed in clashes with security forces just days after the death of one of its top leaders. The military said at the time that it had killed several more of the cartel's members and taken two captive during an operation in the country's northwest.",
      "n 2022, Clan de Golfo shut down dozens of towns in northern Colombia for four days in reaction to its leader being\u00a0extradited to the U.S. for trial.",
      "Clan del Golfo has been involved in peace talks with Colombia's government since September, which could lead to the disarmament of its fighters in exchange for reduced sentences for its leadership.",
      "Earlier this month, the Colombian government and the AGC signed an agreement in Qatar, under which the group's fighters as of next March will be allowed to gather in specially designated zones in northern and western Colombia where they will be free from prosecution, as peace talks continue. The agreement also states that the Colombian government will suspend any extradition of AGC leaders to the U.S. during negotiations.",
      "Elizabeth Dickinson, a Colombia analyst at the International Crisis Group, said Tuesday's designation could be a message to the Colombian government to take a tougher stance against the group.",
      "\"The tensions between Colombia and Washington are at historic levels,\" Dickinson said.",
      "She added that while terrorist designations are usually meant to stop third parties from doing business with targeted groups, the designation against AGC could be more \"symbolic\" \u2014 and it will \"give pause to Colombian authorities ... going forward.\"",
      "Colombia has also recently held peace talks with the National Liberation Army, also an organization designated as a terrorist group by the U.S., and in the past it struck a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, while it was still designated as a terrorist group.",
      "The designation does not provide the U.S. government with the immediate authority to conduct military strikes, although it enhances the legal framework for attacks against targeted groups to be carried out.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration designated Venezuelan gangs Tren de Aragua and\u00a0Cartel de los Soles\u00a0as foreign terrorist organizations, before launching strikes against alleged drug smuggling boats off the coast of Venezuela, whose legality has been questioned by U.S. lawmakers.",
      "In an\u00a0exclusive conversation with CBS News\u00a0in October, President Petro said some of those killed in recent U.S. strikes off South America have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",
      "The White House denies those accusations, and President Trump has defended the strikes as a legitimate part of his fight against drug trafficking gangs.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. The Trump administration has also accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of sending drug shipments to the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "ASTORIA, Ore. \u2014 Residents of this small coastal city in the Pacific Northwest know what to do when there's a tsunami warning: Flee to higher ground.",
      "For those in or near Columbia Memorial, the city's only hospital, there will soon be a different plan: Shelter in place. The hospital is building a new facility next door with an on-site tsunami shelter \u2014 an elevated refuge atop columns deeply anchored in the ground, where nearly 2,000 people can safely wait out a flood.",
      "Oregon needs more shelters like the one that Columbia Memorial is building, emergency managers say. Hospitals in the region are likely to incur serious damage, if not ruin, and could take more than three years to fully recover in the event of a major earthquake and tsunami, according to a state report.",
      "Columbia Memorial's current facility is a single-story building, made of wood a half-century ago, that would likely collapse and sink into the ground or be swallowed by a landslide after a major earthquake or a tsunami, said Erik Thorsen, the hospital's chief executive.",
      "\"It is just not built to survive either one of those natural disaster events,\" Thorsen said.",
      "At least 10 other hospitals along the Oregon coast are in danger as well. So Columbia Memorial leaders proposed building a hospital capable of withstanding an earthquake and landslide, with a tsunami shelter, instead of relocating the facility to higher ground. Residents and state officials supported the plans, and the federal government awarded a $14 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help pay for the tsunami shelter.",
      "The project broke ground in October 2024. Within six months, the Trump administration had canceled\u00a0the grant program, known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, calling it \"yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program \u2026 more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.\"",
      "Molly Wing, director of the expansion project, said losing the BRIC grant felt like \"a punch to the gut.\"",
      "\"We really didn't see that coming,\" she said.",
      "This summer, Oregon and 19 other states sued to restore the FEMA grants. On Dec. 11, a judge ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully ended the program without congressional approval.",
      "The administration did not immediately indicate it would appeal the decision, but Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said by email: \"DHS has not terminated BRIC. Any suggestion to the contrary is a lie. The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund. It's unfortunate that an activist judge either didn't understand that or didn't care.\" FEMA is a subdivision of DHS.",
      "Columbia Memorial was one of the few hospitals slated to receive grants from the BRIC program, which had announced more than $4.5 billion for nearly 2,000 building projects since 2022.",
      "Hospital leaders have decided to keep building \u2014 with uncertain funding \u2014 because they say waiting is too dangerous. With the Trump administration reversing course on BRIC, fewer communities will receive help from FEMA to reduce their disaster risk, even places where catastrophes are likely.",
      "More than three centuries have passed since a major earthquake caused the Pacific Northwest's coastline to drop several feet and unleashed a tsunami that crashed onto the land in January 1700, according to scientists who study the evolution of the Oregon coast.",
      "The greatest danger is an underwater fault line known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which lies 70 to 100 miles off the coast, from Northern California to British Columbia.",
      "The Cascadia zone can produce a megathrust earthquake, with a magnitude of 9 or higher \u2014 the type capable of triggering a catastrophic tsunami \u2014 every 500 years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Scientists predict a 10% to 15% chance of such an earthquake along the fault zone in the next 50 years.",
      "\"We can't wait any longer,\" Thorsen said. \"The risk is high.\"",
      "Building for the future",
      "The BRIC program started in 2020, during the first Trump administration, to provide communities and institutions with funding and technical assistance to fortify their structures against natural disasters.",
      "Joel Scata, a senior attorney with the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, said the program helped communities better prepare so they could reduce the cost of rebuilding after a flood, tornado, wildfire, or extreme weather event.",
      "To qualify for a grant, a hospital had to show that the project's benefits were greater than the future danger and cost. In some cases, that benefit might not be readily apparent.",
      "\"It prevents bad disasters from happening, and so you don't necessarily see it in action,\" Scata said.",
      "Scata noted that the Trump administration has also stopped awarding grants through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which predates BRIC.",
      "\"There really is no money going out the door from the federal government to help communities reduce their disaster risk,\" he said.",
      "A recent KFF Health News investigation using proprietary data from Fathom, a global leader in flood modeling, found that at least 170 U.S. hospitals are at risk of significant and potentially dangerous flooding from more intense and frequent storms. That count did not include Columbia Memorial, as Fathom's data did not account for tsunamis. It models flooding from rivers, sea level rise, and extreme rainfall.",
      "In recent days, an atmospheric river \u2014 a narrow storm band carrying significant amounts of moisture \u2014 dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Oregon and Washington, causing catastrophic flooding along rivers and the coast. In the Washington town of Sedro-Woolley, which sits along the Skagit River, the PeaceHealth United General Medical Center evacuated nonemergency patients.",
      "High winds battered Astoria, leaving the city with some minor landslides, according to news reports. But flooding on the road to the nearby beach town of Seaside made the drive nearly impassable.",
      "The Trump administration is leaning on states to take greater responsibility for recovering from natural disasters, Scata said, but most states are not financially prepared to do so.",
      "\"The disasters are just going to keep on piling up,\" he said, \"and the federal government's going to have to keep stepping in.\"",
      "A hospital at risk",
      "Columbia Memorial is blocks from the southern shore of the Columbia River, near the Washington border, where the area's natural hazards include earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, and floods. A critical access hospital with 25 beds, it opened in 1977 \u2014 before state building codes addressed tsunami protections.",
      "Thorsen said the new facility and shelter would be a \"model design\" for other hospitals. Design plans show a five-level hospital built atop a foundation anchored to the bedrock and surrounded by concrete columns to shield it from tsunami debris.",
      "The shelter will be on the roof of the second floor, above the projected maximum tsunami inundation. It will be accessible via an outdoor staircase and interior staircases and elevators, with enough room for up to 1,900 people, plus food, water, tents, and other supplies to sustain them for five days.",
      "With most patient care provided on the second and third levels, generators on the fourth level, and utility lines underground, the hospital is expected to remain operational after a natural disaster.",
      "Thorsen said an earthquake and tsunami threaten not only vast flooding but also liquefaction, in which the ground loosens and causes structures above it to collapse. Deep foundations, thick slabs, and other structural supports are expected to protect the new hospital and tsunami structure against such failure.",
      "Through the years, hospital administrators and civic leaders in Astoria have sought other locations for Columbia Memorial. But relocation wasn't economical. Columbia Memorial committed to invest in a new hospital and tsunami shelter to protect not only patients and staff but also nearby residents.",
      "\"Your community should count on your hospital to be a safe haven in a natural disaster,\" Thorsen said.",
      "Fighting to restore funds",
      "The estimated construction budget for Columbia Memorial's expansion is $300 million, mostly financed through new debt from the hospital. The tsunami shelter is budgeted at about $20 million, for which FEMA's BRIC program awarded nearly $14 million, with a $6 million matching grant from the state, which has maintained its support.",
      "The shelter and the building's structural protections \u2014 featuring reinforced steel, deeper foundations, and thicker slabs \u2014 are integral to the design and cannot be removed without compromising the rest of the structure, said Michelle Checkis, the project architect.",
      "\"We can't pull the TVERS [tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structure] out without pulling the hospital back apart again,\" she said. \"It's kind of like, if I was going to stack it up with Legos, I would have to take all those Legos apart and stack it up completely differently.\"",
      "Columbia Memorial has sought help from Oregon's congressional delegation. In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and former FEMA acting administrator David Richardson, the lawmakers demanded that the agencies restore the hospital's grant.",
      "The hospital's leadership is seeking other grants and philanthropic donations to make up for the loss. As a last resort, Thorsen said, the board will consider removing \"nonessential features\" from the building, though he added that there is little fat to trim from the project.",
      "The lawsuit brought by states in July alleged that FEMA lacks the authority to cancel the BRIC program or redirect its funding for other purposes.",
      "The states argued that canceling the program ran counter to Congress' intent and undermined projects underway.",
      "In their response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration said repeatedly that the defendants \"deny that the BRIC program has been terminated.\"",
      "The lawsuit cites examples of projects at risk in each state due to FEMA's termination of the grants. Oregon's first example is Columbia Memorial's tsunami shelter. \"Neither the County nor the State can afford to resume the project without federal funding,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "In response to questions about the impact of canceling the grant on Astoria and the surrounding community, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said BRIC had \"deviated from its statutory intent.\"",
      "\"BRIC was more focused on climate change initiatives like bicycle lanes, shaded bus stops, and planting trees, rather than disaster relief or mitigation,\" McLaughlin said. DHS and FEMA provided no further comment about BRIC or the Astoria hospital.",
      "Preparing for a tsunami disaster",
      "Located near the end of the Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail, Astoria sits on a peninsula that juts into the Columbia River near the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Much of the city is not in the tsunami inundation area. But Astoria's downtown commercial district \u2014 where gift shops, hotels, and seafood restaurants line the streets \u2014 is nearly all an evacuation zone.",
      "Two hospitals \u2014 Ocean Beach Health in nearby Washington, and Providence Seaside Hospital in Oregon \u2014 are about 20 miles from Columbia Memorial. Both are 25-bed hospitals, and neither is designed to withstand a tsunami.",
      "Ocean Beach Health regularly conducts drills for mass-casualty and natural disasters, said Brenda Sharkey, its chief nursing officer.",
      "\"We focus our planning and investments on areas where we can make a real difference for our community before, during, and after an event \u2014 such as maintaining continuity of care, ensuring rapid triage, and coordinating with regional emergency partners,\" Sharkey said in an email.",
      "Gary Walker, a spokesperson for Providence Seaside, said in a statement that the hospital has a \"comprehensive emergency plan for earthquakes and tsunamis, including alternative sites and mobile resources.\"",
      "Walker added that Providence Seaside has hired \"a team of consultants and experts to conduct a conceptual resilience study\" that would evaluate the hospital's vulnerabilities and recommend ways to address them.",
      "Oregon's emergency managers advise residents and visitors in coastal communities to immediately seek higher ground after a major earthquake \u2014 and not to rely on tsunami sirens, social media, or most technology.",
      "\"There may not even be cellphone towers operating after an event like this,\" said Jonathan Allan, a coastal geomorphologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. \"The earthquake shaking, its intensity, and particularly the length of time in which the shaking persists, is the warning message.\"",
      "The stronger the earthquake and the longer the shaking, he said, the more likely a tsunami will head to shore.",
      "A tsunami triggered by a Cascadia zone earthquake could strike land in less than 30 minutes, according to state estimates.",
      "Many of Oregon's seaside communities are near high-enough ground to seek safety from a tsunami in a relatively short time, Allan said. But he estimated that, to save lives, Oregon would need about a dozen vertical tsunami evacuation shelters along the coast, including in seaside towns that attract tourists and where the nearest high ground is a mile or more away.",
      "Willis Van Dusen's family has lived in Astoria since the mid-19th century. A former mayor of Astoria, Van Dusen stressed that tsunamis are not a hypothetical danger. He recalled seeing one in Seaside in 1964. The wave was only about 18 inches high, he said, but it flooded a road and destroyed a bridge and some homes. The memory has stayed with him.",
      "\"It's not like \u2026 'Oh, that'll never happen,'\" he said. \"We have to be prepared for it.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. Capitol has begun displaying a statue of a teenaged Barbara Rose Johns as she protested poor conditions at her segregated Virginia high school.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Capitol on Tuesday began displaying a statue of a teenaged Barbara Rose Johns as she protested poor conditions at her segregated Virginia high school, a pointed replacement for a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that was removed several years ago.",
      "An unveiling ceremony of the statue representing Virginia in the Capitol took place in Emancipation Hall, featuring Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Virginia's congressional delegation and Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger.",
      "Johnson said more than 200 members of Johns' family were on hand, listening on as the ceremony included renditions of \"How Great Thou Art,\" \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me 'Round\" and \"Total Praise\" performed by the Eastern Senior High School choir from Washington.",
      "\"We are here to honor one of America's true trailblazers, a woman who embodied the essence of the American spirit in her fight for liberty and justice and equal treatment under the law, the indomitable Barbara Rose Johns,\" Johnson said.",
      "Johns was 16 years old in 1951 when she led a student strike for equal education at the segregated R.R. Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia. The protest, led by Johns and hundreds of her classmates, sought to draw attention to the crowded, rundown conditions of their school \u2014 especially when compared to all-White schools in the same area.",
      "The students' cause gained the support of NAACP lawyers, who filed a lawsuit that would become one of the five cases that the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed in Brown v. Board of Education. The high court's landmark 1954 decision declared \"separate but equal\" public schools unconstitutional, finding segregated schools to be \"inherently unequal.\"",
      "Johns later married the Rev. William Powell and became Barbara Rose Johns Powell, raised five children and was a librarian in the Philadelphia Public Schools. She died at 56 in 1991.",
      "\"She put God first in her life. She was brave, bold, determined, strong, wise, unselfish, warm and loving,\" said Terry Harrison, one of her daughters.",
      "The statue shows the young Johns standing to the side of a lectern, holding a tattered book over her head. Its pedestal is engraved with the words, \"Are we going to just accept these conditions, or are we going to do something about it?\" It also features a quote from the Book of Isaiah, \"And a little child shall lead them.\"",
      "The statue replaces one of Lee that was removed in December 2020 from the Capitol, where it had represented Virginia for 111 years. The removal occurred during a time of renewed national attention over Confederate monuments after the death of George Floyd and was relocated to the Virginia Museum of History & Culture.",
      "\"The Commonwealth of Virginia will now be properly represented by an actual patriot who embodied the principle of liberty and justice for all, and not a traitor who took up arms against the United States to preserve the brutal institution of chattel slavery,\" Jeffries said at the ceremony.",
      "Johns' sister, Joan Johns Cobbs, read from a journal entry by Johns: \"And then there were times I just prayed, 'God, please grant us a new school, please let us have a warm place to stay where we won't have to keep our coats on all day to stay warm. God, please help us. We are your children too.'\"",
      "The Johns piece is part of the National Statuary Hall Collection at the Capitol, in which each state can contribute two statues. The other statue representing Virginia is of George Washington.",
      "National Statuary Hall displays 35 of the statues. Others are in the Crypt, the Hall of Columns and the Capitol Visitor Center. Johnson said the Johns statue will be placed in the Crypt.",
      "Former Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam had requested the removal of the Lee statue. In December 2020, a state commission recommended replacing Lee's statue with a statue of Johns.",
      "The Johns statue, sculpted by Steven Weitzman of Maryland, received final approval from the Architect of the Capitol and the Joint Committee on the Library in July.",
      "Johns is also featured in a sculpture at the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial outside the state Capitol in Richmond. The former high school is now a National Historic Landmark and museum.",
      "\"It's an incredibly profound moment, a moment to stand in a tar shack classroom with a hot potbelly stove as a heater, tar paper walls, shabby desks, right where 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns courageously organized her schoolmates and stood up to the lie \u2014 the lie was separate but equal,\" Youngkin said of the museum.",

    "story": [
      "A former top official at the National Institutes of Health sued the Trump administration Tuesday, alleging she was illegally fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after she blew the whistle on internal clashes over vaccine research at the agency.",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo ran the NIH division responsible for vaccine research until late March, when she was placed on indefinite leave. In a formal whistleblower complaint, she said she was sidelined because she pushed back against NIH officials appointed by President Trump who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines and canceled long-running clinical trials.",
      "She was terminated in October after she went public with her concerns in an exclusive interview with CBS News, which she claims was a further act of retaliation.",
      "\"I spoke up because the decisions by HHS leadership have put the public's health at risk and wasted billions of dollars \u2014 actions that will have devastating consequences for Americans' safety and wellbeing for decades to come,\" Marrazzo said in a statement on Tuesday, noting that she is seeking her job back and also aims to protect the rights afforded to federal employees who blow the whistle.",
      "\"I was fired for calling this out, but I will not stay silent,\" she said.",
      "A Health and Human Services spokesperson declined to comment on Marrazzo's lawsuit. Under Kennedy, vaccine skeptics have been appointed to leadership roles across the health agencies, raising alarms among career scientists.",
      "Marrazzo's allegations focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claimed Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, who has a long history of sowing doubts about vaccines. In a series of meetings, Memoli argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her lawsuit.",
      "Marrazzo told CBS News it was like \"hearing the echo of\" the vaccine skepticism often promoted by Kennedy. \"It was extremely alarming,\" Marrazzo said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson defended Memoli to CBS News, writing in a statement: \"He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard evidence-based science.\"",
      "In 2023, Marrazzo succeeded Dr. Anthony Fauci as the director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. In September, she followed a well-established whistleblower process for federal workers by filing a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon denied a motion by the National Trust for Historic Preservation that would have temporarily blocked the Trump administration's construction of a new ballroom at the White House, but he set out some requirements for the Trump administration moving forward.",
      "Leon said in a hearing Tuesday in Washington, D.C., that the nonprofit group had not established enough irreparable harm in order to pause the construction outright, but the judge declared construction crews cannot over the next two weeks build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist. Leon said any breaking of that order would result in the White House being \"forced to take it down.\"",
      "The judge is requiring the government to submit construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission by the end of the year, and the Justice Department said that the government has made \"initial outreach\" to set up meetings on that front.",
      "Last week, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed the first major lawsuit against President Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, claiming no president is allowed to\u00a0tear down\u00a0parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "The National Park Service expects the project to be completed in summer 2028, not long before Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The historic preservation group argues that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law, repeatedly arguing in court Tuesday that five laws have been broken by the demolition and build project. Plaintiffs also argued the environmental impact statement submitted by the administration was \"woefully inadequate.\" Much of the East Wing has been demolished as a part of the project.",
      "\"These are things that they can do...as long as they follow the rules,\" an attorney for the group argued Tuesday.",
      "The government contends that it has no obligation to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, an independent government agency, for demolition or below ground work, and insists it has not violated any laws because no plan for the ballroom has been finalized.",
      "\"There is nothing final about this building,\" Justice Department attorney Adam Gustafson argued in court.",
      "The government also argued that the construction and planning are all coming from the Executive Office of the President, and because it's executive action, federal courts have limited power to review it. The National Park Service, however, was named repeatedly in court filings by the Justice Department and wrote a memo in support of the project.",
      "The government said it is \"committed\" to hear input from the Commission of Fine Arts, which presently does not have a quorum because Trump removed most members, and said the lawsuit was filed too late, because demolition was completed a week before the complaint was filed.",
      "There will be a preliminary injunction hearing the second week of January for further arguments.",
      "Mr. Trump celebrated the court ruling later Tuesday, saying \"we just won the case\" and \"we didn't want to be held up.\" He also said the donor-funded ballroom could cost as much as $400 million, up from his previous $300 million estimate, though he added that he expects to get the project done for less.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela, as the administration heaps pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro at sea and leaves the door open for possible land strikes.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment. The Pentagon referred CBS News to the White House.",
      "Last week, the U.S. military seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News. Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump's Tuesday night announcement suggests that further seizures are possible. It's not clear how many vessels are covered by the planned blockade.",
      "The Maduro government called last week's boat seizure \"robbery\" and \"piracy.\" In a statement late Tuesday, Venezuela called the blockade a \"grotesque threat\" and a violation of international law, and accused the Trump administration of seeking to \"appropriate the oil, land and minerals of the country through gigantic campaigns of lies and manipulations.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes any future boat seizures are unlikely to lead to increases in global oil prices, he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0over the weekend. He didn't specify whether a total blockade was on the table, but said the administration is trying to crack down on a \"black market for oil.\"",
      "Venezuela is a major oil producer with some of the world's largest petroleum reserves. But its oil industry has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for years, with the Biden and Trump administrations citing human rights concerns and widespread allegations of fraud in Venezuela's last two elections.",
      "Heavily sanctioned oil producers like Venezuela, Russia and Iran have sought to export their oil despite the U.S. restrictions, in some cases allegedly turning to a global \"shadow fleet\" of older oil tankers with questionable registrations \u2014 a move that has\u00a0vexed\u00a0federal authorities.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he has ramped up economic pressure on Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of colluding with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has denied those allegations.",
      "Last week, the administration sanctioned six ships accused of carrying oil from Venezuela, along with three nephews of Maduro, two of whom were accused of narcotics trafficking and one of whom worked for the country's state oil company.",
      "Late Tuesday, Mr. Trump alleged in a social media post that the Maduro regime was using oil exports to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration has\u00a0taken steps to designate the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a loosely organized group it says is led by Maduro \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization. And Maduro himself faces a $50 million reward for his capture, after he was\u00a0charged with narco-trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020.",
      "Venezuela has also faced pressure from the U.S. military, which has moved naval vessels and fighter jets into the Caribbean and conducted strikes against at least 25 boats it claims were trafficking drugs from Latin America.",
      "And Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested\u00a0he may order strikes on land-based drug targets in Venezuela and other countries, which would mark a significant escalation.",
      "Maduro's government has decried the military buildup, accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change, and vowed to defend itself against any military operations.",
      "The U.S. president has not said explicitly whether he's seeking Maduro's ouster, but he told Politico last week the Venezuelan leader's \"days are numbered.\"",

      "An 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night, when the House Rules Committee blocked several of the amendments they were seeking to the attach to a\u00a0GOP health care plan released last week. The GOP plan does not include an extension.",
      "The committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.",
      "Moderate Republicans are perplexed at the decision not to hold a vote on an extension ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, and have warned of the political ramifications of allowing insurance premiums to soar in the new year for more than 20 million Americans who buy their insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",

      "He urged all Democrats to sign on to two bipartisan discharge petitions\u00a0to force votes on legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms. But even if the discharge petitions hit the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote in the coming days, there's a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can call it up to the floor. The House's last day in session this year is Friday.",

    "summary": "President Trump defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles after she was quoted offering blunt assessments of his inner circle in Vanity Fair.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and members of his Cabinet defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published a lengthy piece featuring her blunt assessment of the president's inner circle, his first year in office and the president himself.",
      "The two-part story, written by author Chris Whipple, features quotes from 11 interviews that Whipple conducted with Wiles from Jan. 11 to Nov. 5.",
      "According to Vanity Fair, Wiles said the president, who doesn't drink, has \"an alcoholic's personality.\"",
      "\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" Wiles said, according to Vanity Fair. \"And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\" Wiles was quoted as saying the president operates with the view that there's \"nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.\"",
      "The president told the New York Post he hadn't read the Vanity Fair piece, but said Wiles is \"fantastic.\" Mr. Trump also defended Wiles' description of him.",
      "\"No, she meant that I'm \u2014 you see, I don't drink alcohol,\" the president told the Post. \"So everybody knows that \u2014 but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that \u2014 what's the word? Not possessive \u2014 possessive and addictive type personality. Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"",
      "Wiles was also quoted as saying Vice President JD Vance has \"been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" and that Attorney General Pam Bondi \"completely whiffed\" on her handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Elon Musk and the way the U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered in the early months of the administration.",
      "\"No rational person could think the USAID process was a good one,\" she said in the story. \"Nobody.\"",
      "In a post on X, her first in more than a year, Wiles, 68, called the story a \"disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she wrote. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Wiles' statement did not deny that she was accurately quoted. CBS News has asked Vanity Fair for any additional comment and whether the publication will be releasing a transcript or audio of the interviews.",
      "Wiles, a longtime political operative in Florida, became the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff when Mr. Trump took office in January. She was named to Forbes' 2025 list of the World's Most Powerful Women earlier this month.",
      "Top administration officials came to Wiles' defense after the Vanity Fair story was published, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reposting many of their comments.",
      "Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, whom Wiles called a \"right-wing absolute zealot\" in the story, called Wiles \"an exceptional chief of staff.\"",
      "\"In my portfolio, she is always an ally in helping me deliver for the president,\" Vought wrote on X. \"And this hit piece will not slow us down.\"",
      "Despite Wiles' criticism of her handling of the Epstein files, Bondi wrote on X: \"My dear friend Susie Wiles fights every day to advance President Trump's agenda \u2013 and she does so with grace, loyalty, and historic effectiveness. Any attempt to divide this administration will fail. Any attempt to undermine and downplay President Trump's monumental achievements will fail. We are family. We are united.\"",
      "\"This is what the Left does: trash & smear our best & most effective people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. \"They do it to President Trump daily \u2014 and now to Chief Susie Wiles. Susie is the most TRUSTED, most PROFESSIONAL & most EFFECTIVE Chief of Staff of my lifetime. Absolutely nobody better!\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that the \"radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump's team,\" adding that \"It won't work because we know & love Susie Wiles.\"",
      "The vice president was asked about the \"conspiracy theorist\" comment by reporters during a trip to Pennsylvania. Vance said he hadn't read the article yet but had heard about it.",
      "\"Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,\" Vance said.",
      "\"And by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time,\" Vance continued. \"For example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask three-year-olds at the height of the COVID pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.\"",
      "He added: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets.\"",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 Democrats were feeling jubilant at this year's Democratic National Committee winter meetings after decisive victories in the off-year elections. Now, they say they are looking to build on the 2025 momentum as they approach next year's midterms \u2014 and beyond.",
      "Two of the most prominent party leaders, both Californians, dominated conversations about 2028 at the annual gathering of party leaders. And there were a couple of clear signals from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris that both upcoming cycles are\u00a0 on their minds.",
      "Newsom quietly switched the timing of his appearance at the conference, according to multiple sources familiar with the original schedule. One top party official said he had done so in order to avoid speaking on Friday, the same day as other potential 2028 presidential contenders. He did not want to share the\u00a0 day, or headlines. Friday was the day Harris was set to deliver the keynote address to the gathering. Newsom changed his visit\u00a0 to Thursday. A California Democrat close to Harris rolled their eyes when asked about the governor's maneuver.",
      "Democrats gave Newsom an enthusiastic welcome, clamoring for handshakes and selfies when he arrived. He told reporters he was there to thank party members for their help on Proposition 50, the ballot measure he championed to enable the legislature to redraw California's congressional map to make five GOP-held districts more friendly to Democrats. The move was intended to offset a Trump-driven redistricting push in Texas that would draw a map aimed at increasing the state's Republican congressional delegation by five.",
      "The California governor said he wanted to help Democratic leaders in states like Missouri confront GOP redistricting efforts and help boost the party's chances of retaking the House in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\" I'd be remiss If I didn't say 'hello',\" he said, explaining his visit. He added that there was a \"sense of optimism here.\"",
      "\" The party, more broadly, I think is feeling like they got their sea legs back. They are winning and winning solves a lot of problems,\"he said to reporters.",
      "Newsom's redistricting initiative galvanized Democrats, Latino voters and young voters in California and beyond, uniting them against the GOP efforts to insulate Republicans from midterm losses. It became a broader rallying cry \u2014 especially among those attending the winter meeting, who told CBS News they're looking for \"fighters\" to lead them out of the political wilderness.",
      "The California venue meant home-state Democrats made up an outsize share of attendees, and they gave a warm welcome to their former senator and the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee when she arrived.",
      "Chants of \"Kamala! Kamala!\" rang out. Harris wasted no time in seizing on Democrats' battle cry of\u00a0 affordability, an issue that was more fraught when she was running as part of the administration, instead of in opposition to it.",
      "\"[Voters] want leaders who fight for affordability, for health care, for the right of people to participate in their democracy,\" she said. \"Americans want leaders who fight for them, and that is what we will continue to do in 2026 as we compete in every state, in every district, and every level of government.\"",
      "She then dropped the biggest hint that she is considering another presidential run.",
      "\"Obviously, we must focus on the midterms, but Democrats, we must also have a clear vision for what comes after the midterms.\"",
      "\"You!\" an audience member yelled.",
      "Harris smiled and continued, \"We need to answer the question, 'What comes next for our party, our democracy?' As we plan what comes after this administration, (we) cannot afford to be nostalgic for what was, in fact, a simple return to what existed in the past,\" Harris said. \"The work ahead requires us to reinvent, to innovate, to inspire and understand that the task before us is not just a political project. It must be a project of civic renewal.\"",
      "She called on Democrats for \"a new commitment\" that is \"not commanded by big corporations or career politicians, not by the elite or wealthy, but by everyday citizens\u2026for the betterment of the country, a commitment that declares that the power of this country does not belong to any king or set of oligarchs.\" It was one of her biggest applause lines.",
      "One DNC voting member and senior Democratic operative told CBS News that Harris remains popular with Democrats: \"She has great relationships with all these people and campaigned in a way that Gov. Newsom hasn't yet had the chance to.\"",
      "For now \u2014 two years before a single primary vote will be cast \u2014 Harris \"clearly has a big advantage when it comes to the party apparatus,\" the operative said. \"But people are very excited to see everybody, including Gov. Newsom. Newsom is showing people how to fight back.\"",
      "Many of the Democrats who attended the winter meeting campaigned for Harris during her 107-day sprint after President Joe Biden exited the 2024 race after his disastrous debate against President Trump and were thrilled by the possibility that Harris could run again. But not everyone sees the dynamic the same way.",
      "\"Harris has to prove to a lot of people that she can be a good candidate again,\" a senior congressional adviser at the meeting told CBS News. \"Newsom is already doing that\" with the redistricting measure. The aide called it a \"huge validation\" of his approach.",
      "Broadly, Democrats say they aren't only relying on anti-Trump messaging going into the midterms. After victories in this year's gubernatorial and mayoral races, the party is trying to emphasize campaign messages around Americans' economic concerns. The Democrats in the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia and in the New York and Miami mayoral races made this the central focus of their successful campaigns, and party strategists are urging other candidates to adopt the same template.",
      "On Friday, DNC Chair Ken Martin put it bluntly in the packed hotel auditorium: \"We know what's important right now. S*** is too expensive.\"",
      "Congress and the midterms",
      "Many Democrats feel optimistic about their prospects in the House. The party in the White House almost always loses ground in midterms, and Mr. Trump's approval ratings have slid. They see the Senate as a steeper climb, with only a handful of clear opportunities for Democrats to win GOP-held seats.",
      "Democrats also still face challenges \u2014 the 2024 erosion of support among Latino voters and younger people and voters without college degrees, as well as internal disagreements among progressives and moderates, were top concerns for those at the L.A. meetings. But they were buoyed by the inroads their 2025 candidates have made with these parts of the electorate.",
      "For this weekend, though, they chose to enjoy the momentum they finally seem to have with their off-year election wins. Party leaders told CBS News they see an opportunity to build on their victories, rather than just offering theoretical arguments and complaints about their failing strategy in last year's decisive defeat at the ballot box.",
      "Multiple Democrats who were asked if they expected a Democratic \"wave\" in 2026 \u2014 as some of their cohorts had predicted leading into the meetings \u2014 offered an emphatic and positive response.",
      "\"100%. Yes,\" one DNC voting member said.",
      "That confidence was underscored, Democrats said, by the pressure they're seeing inside GOP ranks \u2014 noting Indiana Republicans resisted Mr. Trump's GOP-friendly redistricting effort in their state.",
      "Democrats here saw it as a sign that the political terrain is shifting in their favor.",
      "\"We're not looking backward anymore,\" a California Democrat said after Harris' speech. \"We're focused on what's working now: current Democratic governors, current fights, and current wins. Not the past.\"",
      "The Democrat also pointed to a fundraiser on the sidelines of the meetings headlined by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who's often mentioned as a possible 2028 presidential contender. The event, emceed by Conan O'Brien, raised over $1 million for the DNC, according to several Democratic sources. It was the last political event attended by Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele, before they were tragically killed over the weekend. Reiner was also a prominent Democratic party advocate and donor, and happily posed for photographs with his fellow Democrats in attendance.",
      "At another Democratic fundraiser in Los Angeles that closed out the weekend, former President Barack Obama said he feels \"a new energy\" since the party's off-year wins. The former president \u2014 whose 96% favorability rating among Democrats makes him one of the party's most popular figures \u2014 urged Democrats to focus on winning the midterms and developing \"a better story\" to tell voters, rather than on \"nerdy\" internal disagreements that he said most voters see as stuff \"for college seminars.\"",
      "\"Of course there are going to be some tactical differences, but that shouldn't be our primary concern because we're fighting a bigger fight,\" Obama said, according to excerpts obtained by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday more than doubled the list of countries subject to his travel ban or to heavy restrictions, bringing the total number of nations affected by the sweeping set of immigration and entry limits to 39.",
      "The first iteration of the\u00a0travel ban Mr. Trump issued in June included 19 countries, fully barring the entry of immigrants and travelers from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "The proclamation signed by Mr. Trump on Tuesday added seven countries to the list of states facing full entry restrictions: Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Laos, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Syria. It imposed partial entry limits on immigrants and travelers from another 15 countries, including Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation also enacted an entry ban for those traveling with documents issued by the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank. The restrictions on travelers from Turkmenistan were eased, after Mr. Trump said that country had improved its information-sharing with the U.S.",
      "The immigration and travel restrictions include some exceptions, including for permanent U.S. residents from the countries on the list and athletes and staff participating in major sporting events like the FIFA World Cup next year. But Tuesday's proclamation also eliminated an exception, included in the June travel ban, that exempted the children, spouses and parents of U.S. citizens who had requested visas on their behalf.",
      "CBS News had reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was considering expanding its travel ban following the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., on Thanksgiving week. The suspect in that attack, which killed one of the soldiers, is an Afghan man who entered the U.S. in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025.",
      "In his decree on Tuesday, Mr. Trump cited multiple reasons to justify the travel ban's expansion, including concerns about the ability to adequately vet immigrants from the impacted countries and the lack of reliable record-keeping and information-sharing in some of those nations. He also referenced armed conflict, corruption, fraud and terrorism in certain countries on the list.",
      "Mr. Trump said Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica also offer citizenship to foreigners without a residency requirement, creating the risk that someone from the countries subject to the travel ban could seek to gain status in those Caribbean nations to bypass the U.S. entry restrictions.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first administration, versions of his travel ban faced significant public backlash and legal challenges that alleged the policy was discriminatory in nature. In 2018, however, the Supreme Court upheld the president's power to suspend the entry of foreigners on national security grounds through a legal authority known as 212(f).",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans are aiming to move forward on a new package of funding bills before leaving for the holidays, with just weeks to go before the next deadline to avoid another shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are aiming to move forward on a new package of funding bills before leaving town for the holidays, with just weeks to go before the next deadline to avoid another government shutdown.",
      "Congress approved an initial tranche of funding legislation in November as the longest shutdown in history came to an end. But progress has been stalled on additional measures since then. When lawmakers return in the new year, they will have just four weeks to fund the government, or risk a partial shutdown in February.",
      "After approving three of the 12 annual appropriations bills in November, Senate GOP leaders and appropriators were eager to get moving on the next batch of bills. The new package, dubbed a \"minibus,\" is made up of five bills. It would include funding through September for the Department of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development; Commerce, Justice and Science; and Interior and Environment. But issues remain.",
      "\"We're still working it,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning. \"Not there yet.\"",
      "The minibus package, a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation, comes as Republicans have sought to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, rather than through a large end-of-year package. This year, leaders in Congress also opted not to impose a pre-holiday deadline to fund the government, which often raises pressure on lawmakers to agree to a deal before leaving town for the winter recess.",
      "Still, Senate GOP leaders have sought to make progress on the funding package before the chamber breaks later this week.",
      "Asked whether action on the minibus this week is realistic, Thune told reporters \"we'll see.\" Leaders have been working to resolve disagreements with a handful of Senate Republicans who have put \"holds\" on the package, including Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Kennedy of Louisiana. Holds allow individual senators to signal their objections to legislation in its current form.",
      "\"My hope is at least that these, all of these holds that currently exist on the bill on our side at least, are starting to be dealt with in a way that hopefully will get them lifted,\" Thune said. \"But we're not 100% there yet.\"",
      "Kennedy told reporters after Senate Republicans gathered for lunch Tuesday that his and Johnson's holds are the two that remain. Johnson has advocated for the inclusion of his measure to pay federal employees who work during government shutdowns. He told CBS News that he is \"not interested in amendment votes \u2014 I want a result, and we should be able to get a result.\"",
      "\"One thing I've learned about here, when leadership wants to get something done, they get it done,\" Johnson added.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the Senate, told CBS News that the current objections are \"soft holds that I think we can work out.\"",
      "\"I'm hopeful that we'll be on the package tomorrow,\" Collins said.",
      "Should progress stall on the minibus this week, the Senate will face a tight timeline to fund the remaining agencies and government programs upon their return next month. The deal to end the government shutdown earlier this year extended funding until Jan. 30.",
      "The initial batch of funding bills included funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch. The package funded the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026, meaning the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to fund other areas of the government by the end of January.",
      "Thune, asked whether he's concerned about a shutdown in the new year, told reporters that the threat is \"always out there.\"",
      "\"I think that's why it's really important that we do everything we can to consolidate support for getting on the bills and trying to, you know, transact the funding of the government in a way that would prevent that from happening,\" he added.",
      "Part of the calculus for Democrats will likely be the same as in the last shutdown, which became the longest in history at 43 days. The issue at the center of that fight was health care, particularly the expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. But that issue remains unresolved, even after the two parties put forward dueling health care proposals for votes last week. On health care, Thune said he thinks there's a \"potential pathway in January.\"",
      "Amid the effort to pass another package of funding measures, Thune said he and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke briefly Tuesday morning and there are \"conversations going all the time.\"",
      "\"We're working with the Dems, the hotlines have been running on both sides, and trying to figure out how do we, you know, fund the government in a way that I think reflects the views of this United States Senate and not a continuing resolution,\" Thune said. \"And I think both sides see the value in doing that. So I'm still hopeful that there will be a convergence around getting on the bills and moving them in a way that would prevent us having to deal, at the end of January, with another shutdown.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Recently released emails document Jeffrey Epstein's involvement in Leon Black's personal affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Documents released by Congress shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein's role in an attempt to help billionaire Leon Black squelch an accusation of sexual impropriety.",
      "Epstein's relationship with Black has already faced extensive scrutiny, but recently released, previously unreported emails from the House Oversight Committee document Epstein's involvement in Black's personal affairs while the private equity investor paid him huge sums for wealth management advice.",
      "Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, had a six-year affair with a former Russian model named Guzel Ganieva, whom he met at a party in New York City in 2008, according to court records. It was a relationship that ended in acrimony, with Ganieva accusing Black of sexual abuse \u2014 allegations Black denies.",
      "As Black prepared a nondisclosure agreement to secure Ganieva's silence about their affair, Epstein offered him some advice. Epstein suggested in a Sept. 21, 2015, email that Black hire former law enforcement officers to approach Ganieva about the agreement.",
      "\"Choose method of message delivery, my choice. - two highly respected former ---- fill in the blank, immigration, scotland yard. sfo. . who may knock on her door and present the terms,\" Epstein wrote in his typical email style, forsaking standard grammar and punctuation.",
      "Black had learned that Ganieva was planning to travel from London to New York to confront him. And Epstein suggested a similar approach if she showed up stateside. \"Have the same types of individuals [available] in new york if she decides to return as stated.. i prefer former fbi, or immigration one man one woman.\"",
      "Epstein did not mention Ganieva by name, but details in the email make it clear he's referring to her. A spokesperson for Black did not dispute that conclusion. An attorney for Ganieva declined to comment.",
      "Epstein penned a follow-up email minutes later, giving Black's assistant and attorney further instructions. Epstein wrote that Black's assistant \"should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an apollo server.\"",
      "No other emails in the trove released by Congress appear to address Black's long-running dispute with Ganieva.",
      "Ernest Badway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney who frequently represents clients in internal investigations, said an exchange of this nature should have set off red flags inside his company when they later looked into Black's ties to Epstein.",
      "\"As an investigator, that would concern me if I saw an email that people sent on the business's server saying, 'set up a private email so we can have private conversations.' You know, what are those private conversations about?\" Badway said.",
      "Epstein spent years forging relationships that bridged his business interests with his connections to international law enforcement and intelligence figures \u2014 including some powerful players in Russia. He engaged in transactions with Russian banks involving hundreds of millions of dollars, a congressional investigator, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, said in July. He frequently met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, until Churkin's death in 2017. And he nurtured a relationship with former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov \u2014 a reputed FSB agent.",
      "In the summer of 2015, Epstein reached out to Belyakov for information on Ganieva to determine whether she was working for the Russian government, according to The Dossier Center, a website run by former Russian oligarch and Putin critic Mikhail Kordokovsky.",
      "On Oct. 18, 2015, Ganieva signed a nondisclosure contract with Black in which the billionaire agreed to pay her $100,000 monthly for 15 years, forgive a $1 million loan and provide two million British pounds for her to obtain legal status in the U.K.",
      "Two months later, Epstein emailed Black seeking additional payments for his financial advice.",
      "\"As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done ( both known and some things that will need (sp) to remain unknown.)\" Epstein wrote.",
      "The nondisclosure agreement broke down four years later, leading to a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Court filings show Black discussed Ganieva's deal with two people, Epstein and a private investigator. It's unclear if Black turned to the private investigator \u2014 who had spent decades working for the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 because Epstein had suggested hiring ex-law enforcement.",
      "Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, told CBS News that his relationship with Epstein has already been the subject of an internal investigation commissioned by Apollo, and conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP.",
      "\"Epstein's emails, to which Mr. Black never responded, make it clear that Epstein was a braggart who embellished and exaggerated his role and responsibilities in many ways,\" Estrich said. \"Mr. Black's consensual relationship with Ms. Ganieva ended with an amicable settlement in 2015 and a voluntary non-disclosure agreement. Ms. Ganieva's unfounded lawsuit against Mr. Black has been dismissed by the trial court and that decision was upheld on appeal.\"",
      "The Dechert investigation concluded that Black paid Epstein $158 million for work related to his family office, \"and that Black genuinely believed that Epstein was extremely smart, capable, and saved him substantial amounts of money.\" The Dechert report made no mention of any effort by Epstein to advise Black regarding Ganieva \u2014 only that Black had \"confided\" in Epstein about certain personal matters.",
      "\"Mr. Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and Dechert investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents and concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice, no more, no less,\" Estrich said.",
      "It's unclear if the two emails about Ganieva were among those turned over to Dechert's investigators. The Dechert investigation was led by Andrew Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Levander, who also represented former CBS CEO Les Moonves when he was the focus of an internal investigation in 2018, declined to comment.",
      "Black stepped down from the company he founded in March 2021, citing health concerns, two months after the Dechert report was finalized.",
      "Sen. Wyden \u2014 who has spent nearly four years investigating the financial relationship between Black and Epstein \u2014 says Black's payments to Epstein actually reached $170 million and he does not believe the emerging picture matches Black's explanation for paying Epstein nine-figure \"fees\" for tax advice.",
      "\"All along Mr. Black's story has been that he, a multi-billionaire Wall Street titan who employed the finest tax and estate planning minds in America, had to pay astronomical rates for special tax advice from Jeffrey Epstein, who was neither a tax attorney nor an accountant,\" Wyden told CBS News. \"I've never found Black's account believable, and every new revelation in this case raises more troubling questions about what really motivated his payments to Epstein and whether previous investigations of this matter covered up the truth.\"",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect that the nondisclosure agreement between Black and Ganieva only sought confidentiality about their affair.",

      "Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar said federal immigration agents pulled over her son on Saturday and asked him to prove his citizenship.",
      "\"Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,\" Omar said in an interview with Esme Murphy on WCCO Sunday Morning.",
      "The congresswoman said her son \"always carries\" his passport with him.",
      "Omar said ICE also previously entered a mosque where her son and others were praying, but left without incident. After that, she said she \"had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.\"",
      "ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons said the agency has \"absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son\" and accused her of trying to \"unfairly demonize our law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Lyons also said Omar's allegations of racial profiling are \"disgusting, reckless and categorically false.\"",
      "When asked about Lyons' statement, a spokesperson for Omar's office stood by the congresswoman's comments.",
      "\"ICE has long operated as a rogue agency beyond reform. It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight,\" the spokesperson said. \"ICE now claims it has records of all the stops, and our office would welcome the opportunity to review them.\"",
      "Earlier this month, federal agents surged into the Twin Cities with the stated goal of targeting undocumented Somali immigrants. The enhanced focus on the Somali community came after President Trump said he doesn't \"want them in our country\" and called Omar herself \"garbage.\"",
      "On Friday, Omar sent a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, accusing federal agents of \"blatant racial profiling\" and \"an egregious level of unnecessary force\" in the Twin Cities.",
      "\"It is clear to me that this surge came in direct response to\u00a0Trump's racist comments about Somali people, and\u00a0about me in particular,\" Omar wrote.",
      "U.S. Census Bureau data show Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the country \u2014 about 107,000, more than 80,000 of them living in the Twin Cities. Omar contends that \"over 90% of Somalis in America are U.S. citizens,\" citing an American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau that estimates about 22,000 Somalis in the country \u2014 around 8.4% of the population \u2014 are not citizens.",

    "summary": "Attorney General Pam Bondi said the FBI and Justice Department thwarted \"what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot\" in Southern California.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that four members of a far-left anti-government group have been arrested and face charges for allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks across Southern California on New Year's Eve.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X that the Justice Department and FBI \"prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,\" which encompasses Los Angeles and Orange County.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said that the four people who face charges for the alleged plot in California are members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Bondi described the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Bill Essayli, who leads the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, said at a press conference that the four individuals were arrested Friday in San Bernardino County, where they gathered to construct and detonate test explosive devices in the Mojave Desert. He said the suspects allegedly crafted a \"detailed, coordinated plot\" to bomb two U.S. companies on New Year's Eve, with the devices simultaneously exploding at midnight. Essayli did not name the companies but said they were \"logistics centers.\"",
      "\"This case is another reminder about the dangers that radicalized antifa-like groups pose to people, public safety and the rule of law,\" he said.",
      "The defendants are identified in court papers as Audrey Carroll, Zachary Page, Dante Gaffield and Tina Lai.",
      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",
      "A fifth person, Micah James Legnon, was arrested in Louisiana and charged with one count of making threats in interstate commerce. A FBI agent said in an\u00a0affidavit that Legnon appears to be a member of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and \"intended to travel to New Orleans to carry out an attack by means of weapons.\" Legnon, who served in the U.S. Marines, was stopped by law enforcement on a highway in Louisiana on Friday and had an assault rifle, pistol, gas canister, and body armor in his car, according to court papers.",
      "The Turtle Island Liberation Front describes itself on Facebook as a political organization that seeks \"liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized people across the world.\" Turtle Island is the name used by some Indigenous peoples for North America.",
      "The group has expressed pro-Palestinian messages on social media and has said it is fighting against \"fascist colonizers.\" It has urged followers to bring Palestinian flags to protests.",
      "An Instagram account for the group's Los Angeles chapter\u00a0says it advocates for \"liberation through decolonization and tribal sovereignty.\" The group does not appear to be particularly well-known: its Instagram account had fewer than 900 followers as of Monday morning, and its Facebook page was followed by just 32 users.",
      "Mr. Trump has targeted far-left groups and movements as leading domestic terrorism threats. In September, the president signed a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0calling for the creation of a \"national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence,\" as well as investigations into organizations that he believes engage in political violence. He claimed that violent conduct is animated by \"anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity\" views.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0signed an executive order labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" even though antifa is a political movement with no official leadership or organization structure.",
      "Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who researches high-risk activism and political violence, said the Turtle Island Liberation Front appears to be part of the larger ecosystem of groups that the Trump administration is focusing on, with a far-left, anarchist, anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist ideology.",
      "\"The individuals that were involved in this alleged plot appear to be a splinter group or an offshoot of the larger Turtle Island Liberation Front,\" he said. \"In other words, I believe that there are members of the Turtle Island Liberation Front that had nothing to do with this plot, and what we appear to be seeing is several individuals that have decided to escalate their activism to actual political violence.\"",
      "Kenney said the group appears to be small, but active in terms of digital and offline activism.",
      "\"This is a group that has an ideology, they have a set of political ideas that they follow, that they are trying to implement,\" he said. \"What they're trying to do here is bring attention to those ideas and their beliefs.\"",
      "Federal officials said one of the defendants, Carroll, 30, created a \"detailed bombing plot\" in November and provided it to a FBI source. She allegedly worked with Page, 32, to obtain and build the bombs, and to recruit participants for the plan. Essayli said Carroll's \"bomb plot was explicit,\" and included instructions for building the devices and targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.",
      "\"These bombs were to blow up at the same time, on midnight this New Year's Eve,\" said Akil Davis, FBI assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. \"The plan stated that the IEDs would be complex pipe bombs. It included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and contained guidance on how to avoid leaving evidence behind that can be traced back to them.\"",
      "Carroll and Page also allegedly discussed plans to target federal immigration agents and vehicles with pipe bombs after the bombings, according to Essayli.",

    "summary": "President Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against the BBC on Monday over a documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech on the Ellipse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against the BBC on Monday over a documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech on the Ellipse.",
      "The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team asked for $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion.",
      "In a 33-page complaint, attorneys for Mr. Trump accused the BBC of publishing a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary that aired in the U.K. a week before the 2024 election. One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims that the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington, D.C., before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims that the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in his speech. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that \"concerns\" about the documentary were raised internally at the network ahead of air \"but the BBC ignored those concerns and did not take corrective action,\" citing a report by the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team said in part that the BBC has a \"long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda.\"",
      "A BBC spokesperson said the broadcaster \"will be defending this case.\"",
      "Critics of the \"Panorama\" documentary say it makes the president look like he was urging people to attack the Capitol. Mr. Trump's critics have long argued that his words on Jan. 6 \u2014 and his false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election \u2014 fueled the riot. The president has defended his conduct, saying he used only \"beautiful words\" on Jan. 6, but the BBC used \"terrible words.\"",
      "\"I'm suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth, literally,\" the president said Monday. \"They put words in my mouth. They had me saying things that I never said, coming out. I guess they used AI or something.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the BBC unless it retracted the documentary and offered financial compensation.",
      "In November, the BBC apologized to Mr. Trump for the episode, but declined to compensate him for it. In a statement at the time, the BBC said it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim. BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigned amid the editing controversy.",
      "A lawyer for the BBC wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump's legal team that the broadcaster had \"no intention of misleading anyone. He argued the president can't show that the BBC acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning it intentionally or recklessly published false information \u2014 a prerequisite for most defamation suits against public figures in the U.S.",
      "The attorney also argued the president cannot sue the BBC in Florida because the documentary was not aired in the U.S. or made available on the BBC's website for American viewers.",
      "Despite the apology, the president's legal filing says, the network has \"made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.\" Mr. Trump's lawyers also argued that the BBC can be sued in Florida because the \"Panorama\" documentary was available to U.S. viewers on its BritBox streaming service.",
      "Last month, U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"clearly owed a fulsome apology,\" but any lawsuit would face \"a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown on television in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true. And they can point to all sorts of previous judicial findings which have said that there was some measure of incitement in which the president was involved.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Jamie Raskin wants to see White House construction like President Trump's ballroom project subjected to the same scrutiny as other federal projects.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland plans to introduce legislation Tuesday that would subject White House renovations like President Trump's ballroom project to the same reviews as other federal projects. Currently, the White House is exempt from certain oversight under the National Historic Preservation Act.",
      "Raskin's bill, called the \"People's White House Historic Preservation Act,\" would require White House renovations to undergo a so-called \"Section 106 review,\" a pre-ground breaking assessment that addresses the impact of renovations on historic buildings and allows the public to weigh in.",
      "The legislation comes three months after construction crews began work on a privately-financed, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition that will cost about $300 million. A construction crane hangs over the site where the East Wing once stood. It was demolished in late October, even though President Trump had previously said the new construction would be \"near it but not touching it \u2014 and pays total respect to the existing building.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has reveled in how easy it's been to fast track the project. In October, Mr. Trump recounted being told, \"Sir, this is the White House, you're the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.\"",
      "\"It's kings who treat public property as private property,\" Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told CBS News in a phone interview. \"It's not his house; it's our house. And if there is going to be construction and renovation expansion or changes, that should go through a regular public process.\"",
      "The White House asserts Mr. Trump has \"full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House.\"",
      "Aside from renderings Mr. Trump has shown at various events, ballroom schematics have faced little formal scrutiny \u2014 but that may soon change.",
      "In a court filing late Monday, the administration said consultations \"will soon be underway\" with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, two independent advisory boards overseeing federal projects in the Washington area. The administration added that it was not legally bound to confer with either board and that above-ground ballroom construction would begin in April at the earliest.",
      "Raskin's bill would mandate consultations with both commissions prior to ground breaking.",
      "At its monthly meeting in early December, NCPC chairman Will Scharf, who is also a White House staffer, said the White House was not required to submit demolition plans because the commission only oversees new construction.",
      "\"We simply do not have jurisdiction over demolition and site preparation work; that what we're really concerned about here is visible architecture \u2014 is above-ground build,\" Scharf said, adding that NCPC would play a \"constructive role\" when the time comes.",
      "Raskin argues that leveling the East Wing without a review process was a violation of destruction of federal property laws, though he acknowledges the president cannot be prosecuted under those statutes.",
      "Currently, Raskin's legislation has 27 Democratic co-sponsors. With Republicans in control of the House, the measure faces long odds.",
      "\"I hope that there are enough champions of the public-private distinction in the Republican caucus that we can bring some over,\" Raskin said.",
      "Last week, National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit seeking to halt ballroom construction. \"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever \u2014 not President Trump, not President Biden, not anyone else,\" the Trust's suit said. \"And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "In response, the administration said the Trust's complaint was moot \"because the demolition has already occurred and cannot be undone.\"",
      "An initial hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Washington.",

      "Monday's strikes killed eight men across three boats, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a post on X. It alleged the occupants were \"male narco-terrorists\" and the boats were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and were engaged in narco-trafficking.\" The strike was authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Southern Command said.",

      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime.

    "summary": "President Trump's White House ballroom addition is expected to be finished a few months before the 2028 elections.",
    "story": [
      "Construction of the White House's planned $300 million ballroom is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028, just months before President Trump leaves office, according to an environmental assessment prepared by the National Park Service in late August.",
      "The assessment finds some shortcomings in the presidential project, mostly stemming from the sheer size of the new structure. The 90,000 square-foot building \u2014 nearly double the size of the existing executive mansion \u2014 will \"disrupt the historical continuity of the White House grounds and alter the architectural integrity of the east side of the property,\" it found.",
      "\"The new building's larger footprint and height will dominate the eastern portion of the site, creating a visual imbalance with the more modestly scaled West Wing and Executive Mansion,\" the report continues. \"These changes will adversely alter the design, setting, and feeling of the White House and the grounds over the long-term.\"",
      "However, it goes on to conclude that the space will be beneficial for large gatherings, perpetual changes and adaptations are part of the White House's history, and the ballroom annex \"will not result in a significant adverse impact to historic buildings.\"",
      "The report was prepared by NPS Deputy Director Frank Land and approved by Jessica Bowron, the service's acting director.",
      "When the ballroom project was announced on July 31, President Trump said the ballroom addition \"won't interfere with the current building. \u2026 It will be near it but not touching it.\"",
      "But less than a month later, the plan changed. The Aug. 28 document concluded, \"The existing East Wing and East Colonnade will be deconstructed.\" The East Wing was ultimately torn down in late October.",
      "Prior to demolition, the Park Service said all museum collections, artifacts, and paintings would be removed from the East Wing and preserved. Steps were also taken to potentially reinstall wood paneling, light fixtures, interior columns and items from the East Wing movie theater.",
      "Preservationists also saved the commemorative cornerstone and the bronze plaque from the East Wing's 1942 renovation, two fanlight windows and the Kennedy Garden arbor.",
      "The environmental assessment contains design details of the new ballroom, which will be attached to the executive mansion via a bi-level corridor.",
      "\"Materials will include a white painted exterior, historically compatible windows and doors, and an architecturally compatible roof,\" it says. \"Interior finishes will include stone slab flooring, decorative plaster moldings, and high-quality finishes for elevator cabs.\"",
      "The East Wing has long served as the visitors' entrance for formal White House events and tours \u2014 and it will continue to do so. In addition, \"Ground-floor restrooms will support events on the South Lawn,\" the document said.",
      "The NPS environmental assessment emerged from a lawsuit filed by the Trust for Historic Preservation that seeks to halt ballroom construction. The suit alleged that the Trump administration skirted federal law by tearing down the East Wing and drawing up plans for a massive new ballroom without going through a review process. The government has argued that the president has extensive power to make changes to the White House.",
      "Overall, the NPS assessment found that the project will cause \"no significant impact.\"",
      "But that does not mean no impact at all.",
      "Trees and shrubs, including commemorative Southern Magnolias planted in the 1940s, will be removed from the lawn due to the size of the 90,000-square-foot addition.",
      "President Trump has complained about temporary tents brought in for large events like state dinners. While the ballroom will eliminate the needs for those structures, NPS assesses that \"views of the White House from Lafayette Park and the Ellipse will be permanently altered due to the modifications to the East Wing.",
      "One view won't be changed: the vista from the White House to the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial.",
      "In reaching its \"no significant impact\" finding, the National Park Service's analysis examined various facets of the project \u2014 cultural landscape, historic buildings, visitor access and experience, public health and safety, economic impact and quality of life of the American people.",
      "The East Garden will be removed and reinstalled. Bricks, a fountain and a statue will be \"carefully dismantled and preserved for future reinstallation,\" it said.",
      "The assessment anticipated that grass would need to be replaced and roads repaved because of damage from heavy construction equipment.",
      "It also warned that construction vibrations \"could affect the structural stability or finishes of the Executive Mansion and adjacent features.\"",
      "The NPS said it would document the now-demolished East Wing's interior and exterior with a 3-D survey and high resolution photographs.",
      "The park service also considered the impact on endangered species native to the region including the northern long-eared bat, tricolored bat and monarch butterfly. Ultimately it found \"no meaningful, measurable or noticeable impact\" on the animals.",

    "summary": "President Trump took to social media on Monday with disparaging comments on Rob Reiner's political views, a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took to social media on Monday to disparage the political views of actor and director Rob Reiner a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home in what police are calling an apparent homicide. The president's comments were quickly condemned by a number of lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested\u00a0for murder and is now being held without bail, police said Monday.",
      "Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\"",
      "\"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"",
      "Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who\u00a0 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on X.",
      "A reporter asked the president later Monday if he stands by his post. Mr. Trump did not apologize.",
      "\"Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all,\" the president said. \"He was a deranged person, as fall as Trump was concerned,\" he said, saying Reiner was \"one of the people behind\" the \"Russia hoax.\" \"I think he hurt himself career-wise. Became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.\"",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters that Mr. Trump \"should've said nothing.\"",
      "\"I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements and his agenda,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He continued: \"And just speaking personally, when someone is murdered or assassinated, as happened to Mr. Kirk, we should show him and his family respect,\" referring to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners' killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",
      "And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

      "The Trump administration intends to dismantle one of the world's leading climate research institutions over what it said on Tuesday were concerns about \"climate alarmism,\" despite opposition to the plan.",
      "The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), established in 1960 as a federally funded research and education hub in Boulder, Colorado, will be broken up, White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said on social media.",
      "Any of its operations deemed \"vital,\" such as weather research, will be moved \"to another entity or location,\" he said.",
      "\"This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,\" Vought said.",
      "The National Science Foundation will be breaking up the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country. A comprehensive review is underway & any vital activities such as weather\u2026",
      "The plan was first\u00a0reported\u00a0by USA Today. It said moves to dismantle NCAR will begin immediately.",
      "Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished NCAR scholar,\u00a0told The Washington Post breaking up the laboratory would result in a major loss of scientific research.",
      "Trenberth, an honorary academic in physics at New Zealand's University of Auckland, said the center was crucial to the search for advanced climate science discoveries.",
      "Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which oversees NCAR, told the Post that, \"Any plans to dismantle NSF NCAR would set back our nation's ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to severe weather and other natural disasters.\"",
      "The White House noted that NCAR's budget\u00a0more than doubled\u00a0from the 1980s to the 1990s and called it \"the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy,\" pointing to examples of its research on wind turbines and air pollution.",
      "Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement on Tuesday that he hadn't been briefed on the plans by White House officials, but said, \"If true, public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.\"",
      "He said part of the NCAR's work provides data on severe weather events \"that help our country save lives and property, and prevent devastation for families.\"",

    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "story": [
      "A stray comet from another star swings past Earth this week in one last hurrah before racing back toward interstellar space.",
      "Discovered over the summer, the comet known as 3I/Atlas will pass within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of our planet on Friday, the closest it gets on its grand tour of the solar system.",
      "NASA continues to aim its space telescopes at the visiting ice ball, estimated to be between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles in size. But it's fading as it exits, so now's the time for backyard astronomers to catch it in the night sky with their telescopes.",
      "The comet will come much closer to Jupiter in March, zipping within 33 million miles. It will be the mid-2030s before it reaches interstellar space, never to return, said Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies.",
      "It's the third known interstellar object to cut through our solar system. Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas originate in star systems elsewhere in the Milky Way, while home-grown comets like Halley's hail from the icy fringes of our solar system.",
      "A telescope in Hawaii discovered the first confirmed interstellar visitor in 2017. Two years later, an interstellar comet was spotted by a Crimean amateur astronomer. NASA's sky-surveying Atlas telescope in Chile spotted comet 3I/Atlas in July while prowling for potentially dangerous asteroids.",
      "Scientists believe the latest interloping comet, also harmless, may have originated in a star system much older than ours, making it a tantalizing target.",
      "NASA has released several images of 3I/Atlas, including one last month showing it move through space about 180 million miles from Earth.",
      "In October, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet, appearing to move against a backdrop of distant stars as it was about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "In September, an\u00a0image showed the growing tail\u00a0of 3I/ATLAS streaking across our solar system.",
      "Harvard scientist Ari Loeb, who believes he's seen\u00a0proof of alien life\u00a0before, said he suspected the object may instead have alien origins.",
      "\"We should put all possibilities on the table that it's a rock, a comet, or something else until we get the evidence, the data that will tell us what it is,\"\u00a0Loeb said in an interview\u00a0with CBS Boston.",

    "summary": "Super-Earth TOI-561b is about 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the sun.",
    "story": [
      "A rocky exoplanet outside the Earth's solar system may have an atmosphere, according to new evidence gathered by NASA researchers.",
      "The exoplanet, known as super-Earth TOI-561b, was discovered in 2020, according to NASA. Scientists have determined that the planet is ultra-hot, with a low density. It is about 1.4 times wider than Earth and orbits the sun in about 11 hours. Its host star is similar to Earth's sun in size and temperature, but the exoplanet is 40 times closer to that star than Mercury is to the sun, NASA said in a news release. Observations suggest the exoplanet has a global magma ocean and that it is surrounded by a thick layer of gas.",
      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",

      "\"Nuno was not only a brilliant scientist, he was a brilliant person,\" Dennis Whyte, an engineering professor who was the former head of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, said in an MIT obituary. \"He shone a bright light as a mentor, friend, teacher, colleague, and leader, and was universally admired for his articulate, compassionate manner.\"",
      "The president of MIT, Sally Kornbluth, said in a statement that Loureiro's death was a \"shocking loss.\"",
      "The homicide investigation in Brookline comes as police in Providence, Rhode Island, about 50 miles away, continue to search for the gunman who killed two students and injured nine others at Brown University\u00a0on Saturday. The FBI on Tuesday said it knew of no connection between the crimes.",
      "A neighbor of Loureiro's who did not want to be identified told CBS News Boston he heard \"three loud bangs\" Monday evening.",
      "\"I thought at first it was somebody in our apartment kicking in a door or something so I called the neighbors and they said no they thought it was gunshots,\" he said.",
      "A 22-year-old student at Boston University who lives near Loureiro's apartment in Brookline told The Boston Globe she also heard three loud noises Monday evening and feared it was gunfire. \"I had never heard anything so loud, so I assumed they were gunshots,\" Liv Schachner was quoted as saying. \"It's difficult to grasp. It just seems like it keeps happening.\"",
      "Anne Greenwald, who has lived in the neighborhood for 40 years, told CBS News Boston she and her husband also heard a noise that sounded like gunshots. \"He had a young family, they went to school here,\" she said. \"It's horrible, very scary.\"",
      "Some of Loureiro's students visited his home, an apartment in a three-story brick building, Tuesday afternoon to pay their respects, the Globe reported.",
      "MIT said Loureiro was known for his research on how plasma works, \"particularly turbulence and the physics underpinning\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and other astronomical phenomena.\" He was also studying how to harness clean\u00a0\"fusion power\"\u00a0to combat climate change.",
      "\"Professionally I'm completely overwhelmed with what MIT is,\" he said in a\u00a02017 interview.\u00a0\"You read about it and you talk to people about it, but before you've experienced it, I don't think you quite understand the type of place it is.\"",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Portugal, John J. Arrigo, expressed his condolences in an online post that honored Loureiro for his leadership and contributions to science.",
      "\"I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Nuno Loureiro, who led MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center,\" Arrigo said in a\u00a0statement on X. \"We honor his life, his leadership in science, and his enduring contributions.\"",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president will discuss his accomplishments since taking office in January and what he plans to do over the course of the next three years. The address will be from the Diplomatic Reception Room, not the Oval Office.",
      "The White House and the president have been working to highlight his record to voters, heading into what's expected to be a tough midterm election year. Mr. Trump hit the road to deliver a speech in Pennsylvania last week, where he touted his economic policies. Vice President JD Vance was also in Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote the administration's agenda.",

Mr. Trump was in Florida at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on Dec. 5\u00a0to buy a part of Warner Bros.\u00a0in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on Dec. 8 with an all-cash\u00a0$30 per share\u00a0for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News) would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "A spokesperson for Paramount Skydance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 05:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Columbia Memorial Hospital near Oregon's coastline is forging ahead with emergency plans in case of a major earthquake or tsunami.",
    "story": [
      "ASTORIA, Ore. \u2014 Residents of this small coastal city in the Pacific Northwest know what to do when there's a tsunami warning: Flee to higher ground.",
      "For those in or near Columbia Memorial, the city's only hospital, there will soon be a different plan: Shelter in place. The hospital is building a new facility next door with an on-site tsunami shelter \u2014 an elevated refuge atop columns deeply anchored in the ground, where nearly 2,000 people can safely wait out a flood.",
      "Oregon needs more shelters like the one that Columbia Memorial is building, emergency managers say. Hospitals in the region are likely to incur serious damage, if not ruin, and could take more than three years to fully recover in the event of a major earthquake and tsunami, according to a state report.",
      "Columbia Memorial's current facility is a single-story building, made of wood a half-century ago, that would likely collapse and sink into the ground or be swallowed by a landslide after a major earthquake or a tsunami, said Erik Thorsen, the hospital's chief executive.",
      "\"It is just not built to survive either one of those natural disaster events,\" Thorsen said.",
      "At least 10 other hospitals along the Oregon coast are in danger as well. So Columbia Memorial leaders proposed building a hospital capable of withstanding an earthquake and landslide, with a tsunami shelter, instead of relocating the facility to higher ground. Residents and state officials supported the plans, and the federal government awarded a $14 million grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help pay for the tsunami shelter.",
      "The project broke ground in October 2024. Within six months, the Trump administration had canceled\u00a0the grant program, known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, calling it \"yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program \u2026 more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.\"",
      "Molly Wing, director of the expansion project, said losing the BRIC grant felt like \"a punch to the gut.\"",
      "\"We really didn't see that coming,\" she said.",
      "This summer, Oregon and 19 other states sued to restore the FEMA grants. On Dec. 11, a judge ruled that the Trump administration had unlawfully ended the program without congressional approval.",
      "The administration did not immediately indicate it would appeal the decision, but Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said by email: \"DHS has not terminated BRIC. Any suggestion to the contrary is a lie. The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund. It's unfortunate that an activist judge either didn't understand that or didn't care.\" FEMA is a subdivision of DHS.",
      "Columbia Memorial was one of the few hospitals slated to receive grants from the BRIC program, which had announced more than $4.5 billion for nearly 2,000 building projects since 2022.",
      "Hospital leaders have decided to keep building \u2014 with uncertain funding \u2014 because they say waiting is too dangerous. With the Trump administration reversing course on BRIC, fewer communities will receive help from FEMA to reduce their disaster risk, even places where catastrophes are likely.",
      "More than three centuries have passed since a major earthquake caused the Pacific Northwest's coastline to drop several feet and unleashed a tsunami that crashed onto the land in January 1700, according to scientists who study the evolution of the Oregon coast.",
      "The greatest danger is an underwater fault line known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, which lies 70 to 100 miles off the coast, from Northern California to British Columbia.",
      "The Cascadia zone can produce a megathrust earthquake, with a magnitude of 9 or higher \u2014 the type capable of triggering a catastrophic tsunami \u2014 every 500 years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Scientists predict a 10% to 15% chance of such an earthquake along the fault zone in the next 50 years.",
      "\"We can't wait any longer,\" Thorsen said. \"The risk is high.\"",
      "Building for the future",
      "The BRIC program started in 2020, during the first Trump administration, to provide communities and institutions with funding and technical assistance to fortify their structures against natural disasters.",
      "Joel Scata, a senior attorney with the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, said the program helped communities better prepare so they could reduce the cost of rebuilding after a flood, tornado, wildfire, or extreme weather event.",
      "To qualify for a grant, a hospital had to show that the project's benefits were greater than the future danger and cost. In some cases, that benefit might not be readily apparent.",
      "\"It prevents bad disasters from happening, and so you don't necessarily see it in action,\" Scata said.",
      "Scata noted that the Trump administration has also stopped awarding grants through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which predates BRIC.",
      "\"There really is no money going out the door from the federal government to help communities reduce their disaster risk,\" he said.",
      "A recent KFF Health News investigation using proprietary data from Fathom, a global leader in flood modeling, found that at least 170 U.S. hospitals are at risk of significant and potentially dangerous flooding from more intense and frequent storms. That count did not include Columbia Memorial, as Fathom's data did not account for tsunamis. It models flooding from rivers, sea level rise, and extreme rainfall.",
      "In recent days, an atmospheric river \u2014 a narrow storm band carrying significant amounts of moisture \u2014 dumped more than 15 inches of rain on parts of Oregon and Washington, causing catastrophic flooding along rivers and the coast. In the Washington town of Sedro-Woolley, which sits along the Skagit River, the PeaceHealth United General Medical Center evacuated nonemergency patients.",
      "High winds battered Astoria, leaving the city with some minor landslides, according to news reports. But flooding on the road to the nearby beach town of Seaside made the drive nearly impassable.",
      "The Trump administration is leaning on states to take greater responsibility for recovering from natural disasters, Scata said, but most states are not financially prepared to do so.",
      "\"The disasters are just going to keep on piling up,\" he said, \"and the federal government's going to have to keep stepping in.\"",
      "A hospital at risk",
      "Columbia Memorial is blocks from the southern shore of the Columbia River, near the Washington border, where the area's natural hazards include earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, and floods. A critical access hospital with 25 beds, it opened in 1977 \u2014 before state building codes addressed tsunami protections.",
      "Thorsen said the new facility and shelter would be a \"model design\" for other hospitals. Design plans show a five-level hospital built atop a foundation anchored to the bedrock and surrounded by concrete columns to shield it from tsunami debris.",
      "The shelter will be on the roof of the second floor, above the projected maximum tsunami inundation. It will be accessible via an outdoor staircase and interior staircases and elevators, with enough room for up to 1,900 people, plus food, water, tents, and other supplies to sustain them for five days.",
      "With most patient care provided on the second and third levels, generators on the fourth level, and utility lines underground, the hospital is expected to remain operational after a natural disaster.",
      "Thorsen said an earthquake and tsunami threaten not only vast flooding but also liquefaction, in which the ground loosens and causes structures above it to collapse. Deep foundations, thick slabs, and other structural supports are expected to protect the new hospital and tsunami structure against such failure.",
      "Through the years, hospital administrators and civic leaders in Astoria have sought other locations for Columbia Memorial. But relocation wasn't economical. Columbia Memorial committed to invest in a new hospital and tsunami shelter to protect not only patients and staff but also nearby residents.",
      "\"Your community should count on your hospital to be a safe haven in a natural disaster,\" Thorsen said.",
      "Fighting to restore funds",
      "The estimated construction budget for Columbia Memorial's expansion is $300 million, mostly financed through new debt from the hospital. The tsunami shelter is budgeted at about $20 million, for which FEMA's BRIC program awarded nearly $14 million, with a $6 million matching grant from the state, which has maintained its support.",
      "The shelter and the building's structural protections \u2014 featuring reinforced steel, deeper foundations, and thicker slabs \u2014 are integral to the design and cannot be removed without compromising the rest of the structure, said Michelle Checkis, the project architect.",
      "\"We can't pull the TVERS [tsunami vertical evacuation refuge structure] out without pulling the hospital back apart again,\" she said. \"It's kind of like, if I was going to stack it up with Legos, I would have to take all those Legos apart and stack it up completely differently.\"",
      "Columbia Memorial has sought help from Oregon's congressional delegation. In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and former FEMA acting administrator David Richardson, the lawmakers demanded that the agencies restore the hospital's grant.",
      "The hospital's leadership is seeking other grants and philanthropic donations to make up for the loss. As a last resort, Thorsen said, the board will consider removing \"nonessential features\" from the building, though he added that there is little fat to trim from the project.",
      "The lawsuit brought by states in July alleged that FEMA lacks the authority to cancel the BRIC program or redirect its funding for other purposes.",
      "The states argued that canceling the program ran counter to Congress' intent and undermined projects underway.",
      "In their response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration said repeatedly that the defendants \"deny that the BRIC program has been terminated.\"",
      "The lawsuit cites examples of projects at risk in each state due to FEMA's termination of the grants. Oregon's first example is Columbia Memorial's tsunami shelter. \"Neither the County nor the State can afford to resume the project without federal funding,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "In response to questions about the impact of canceling the grant on Astoria and the surrounding community, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said BRIC had \"deviated from its statutory intent.\"",
      "\"BRIC was more focused on climate change initiatives like bicycle lanes, shaded bus stops, and planting trees, rather than disaster relief or mitigation,\" McLaughlin said. DHS and FEMA provided no further comment about BRIC or the Astoria hospital.",
      "Preparing for a tsunami disaster",
      "Located near the end of the Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail, Astoria sits on a peninsula that juts into the Columbia River near the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Much of the city is not in the tsunami inundation area. But Astoria's downtown commercial district \u2014 where gift shops, hotels, and seafood restaurants line the streets \u2014 is nearly all an evacuation zone.",
      "Two hospitals \u2014 Ocean Beach Health in nearby Washington, and Providence Seaside Hospital in Oregon \u2014 are about 20 miles from Columbia Memorial. Both are 25-bed hospitals, and neither is designed to withstand a tsunami.",
      "Ocean Beach Health regularly conducts drills for mass-casualty and natural disasters, said Brenda Sharkey, its chief nursing officer.",
      "\"We focus our planning and investments on areas where we can make a real difference for our community before, during, and after an event \u2014 such as maintaining continuity of care, ensuring rapid triage, and coordinating with regional emergency partners,\" Sharkey said in an email.",
      "Gary Walker, a spokesperson for Providence Seaside, said in a statement that the hospital has a \"comprehensive emergency plan for earthquakes and tsunamis, including alternative sites and mobile resources.\"",
      "Walker added that Providence Seaside has hired \"a team of consultants and experts to conduct a conceptual resilience study\" that would evaluate the hospital's vulnerabilities and recommend ways to address them.",
      "Oregon's emergency managers advise residents and visitors in coastal communities to immediately seek higher ground after a major earthquake \u2014 and not to rely on tsunami sirens, social media, or most technology.",
      "\"There may not even be cellphone towers operating after an event like this,\" said Jonathan Allan, a coastal geomorphologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. \"The earthquake shaking, its intensity, and particularly the length of time in which the shaking persists, is the warning message.\"",
      "The stronger the earthquake and the longer the shaking, he said, the more likely a tsunami will head to shore.",
      "A tsunami triggered by a Cascadia zone earthquake could strike land in less than 30 minutes, according to state estimates.",
      "Many of Oregon's seaside communities are near high-enough ground to seek safety from a tsunami in a relatively short time, Allan said. But he estimated that, to save lives, Oregon would need about a dozen vertical tsunami evacuation shelters along the coast, including in seaside towns that attract tourists and where the nearest high ground is a mile or more away.",
      "Willis Van Dusen's family has lived in Astoria since the mid-19th century. A former mayor of Astoria, Van Dusen stressed that tsunamis are not a hypothetical danger. He recalled seeing one in Seaside in 1964. The wave was only about 18 inches high, he said, but it flooded a road and destroyed a bridge and some homes. The memory has stayed with him.",
      "\"It's not like \u2026 'Oh, that'll never happen,'\" he said. \"We have to be prepared for it.\"",

      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo ran the NIH division responsible for vaccine research until late March, when she was placed on indefinite leave. In a formal whistleblower complaint, she said she was sidelined because she pushed back against NIH officials appointed by President Trump who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines and canceled long-running clinical trials.",

Leon denied a motion by the National Trust for Historic Preservation that would have temporarily blocked the Trump administration's construction of a new ballroom at the White House, but he set out some requirements for the Trump administration moving forward.",
      "Leon said in a hearing Tuesday in Washington, D.C., that the nonprofit group had not established enough irreparable harm in order to pause the construction outright, but the judge declared construction crews cannot over the next two weeks build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist. Leon said any breaking of that order would result in the White House being \"forced to take it down.\"",
      "The judge is requiring the government to submit construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission by the end of the year, and the Justice Department said that the government has made \"initial outreach\" to set up meetings on that front.",
      "Last week, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed the first major lawsuit against President Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, claiming no president is allowed to\u00a0tear down\u00a0parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "The National Park Service expects the project to be completed in summer 2028, not long before Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The historic preservation group argues that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law, repeatedly arguing in court Tuesday that five laws have been broken by the demolition and build project. Plaintiffs also argued the environmental impact statement submitted by the administration was \"woefully inadequate.\" Much of the East Wing has been demolished as a part of the project.",
      "\"These are things that they can do...as long as they follow the rules,\" an attorney for the group argued Tuesday.",
      "The government contends that it has no obligation to file plans with the National Capital Planning Commission, an independent government agency, for demolition or below ground work, and insists it has not violated any laws because no plan for the ballroom has been finalized.",
      "\"There is nothing final about this building,\" Justice Department attorney Adam Gustafson argued in court.",
      "The government also argued that the construction and planning are all coming from the Executive Office of the President, and because it's executive action, federal courts have limited power to review it. The National Park Service, however, was named repeatedly in court filings by the Justice Department and wrote a memo in support of the project.",
      "The government said it is \"committed\" to hear input from the Commission of Fine Arts, which presently does not have a quorum because Trump removed most members, and said the lawsuit was filed too late, because demolition was completed a week before the complaint was filed.",
      "There will be a preliminary injunction hearing the second week of January for further arguments.",
      "Mr. Trump celebrated the court ruling later Tuesday, saying \"we just won the case\" and \"we didn't want to be held up.\" He also said the donor-funded ballroom could cost as much as $400 million, up from his previous $300 million estimate, though he added that he expects to get the project done for less.",

      "An 11th-hour effort by moderate Republicans to put an extension on the floor for a vote failed Tuesday night, when the House Rules Committee blocked several of the amendments they were seeking to the attach to a\u00a0GOP health care plan released last week. The GOP plan does not include an extension.",
      "The committee advanced the bill to the floor late Tuesday. A vote is expected Wednesday.",
      "Moderate Republicans are perplexed at the decision not to hold a vote on an extension ahead of the Dec. 31 deadline, and have warned of the political ramifications of allowing insurance premiums to soar in the new year for more than 20 million Americans who buy their insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to shut the door on any amendment votes earlier Tuesday, only to open it slightly after a heated meeting with moderates.",

      "He urged all Democrats to sign on to two bipartisan discharge petitions\u00a0to force votes on legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms. But even if the discharge petitions hit the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote in the coming days, there's a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can call it up to the floor. The House's last day in session this year is Friday.",

      "Nick Reiner will be charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances for the killings of his parents, Rob Reiner and his wife Michele Singer Reiner, who were found dead in their home over the weekend, Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman announced Tuesday.",
      "\"Their loss is beyond tragic and we will commit ourselves to bringing their murderer to justice,\" Hochman said at a news conference alongside Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell. He added that this type of case is \"the most serious charge the DA's office can bring against anyone.\"",

      "A statement from the DA's office confirmed the couple was fatally stabbed.

    "story": [
      "Measles outbreaks are growing along the Utah-Arizona border and in South Carolina, where hundreds are in quarantine.",
      "Between Friday and Tuesday, South Carolina health officials confirmed 27 new measles cases in an outbreak in and around northwestern Spartanburg County. In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the vaccine-preventable virus.",
      "More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine \u2014 some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state's new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been \"very helpful,\" said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.",
      "\"We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state,\" Bell said.",
      "In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since August. Mohave County, Arizona, has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit. Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.",
      "Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000. Cases have mostly spread among people who were unvaccinated.",
      "Last month, Canada lost that designation \u2014 which applies when there is no continuous local spread of the virus \u2014 as did the larger health region of the Americas.",
      "Experts say the U.S. is also at risk of losing that status. For that to happen, measles would have to spread continuously for a year. A large outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma that started in January sickened nearly 900 and kicked off the United States' worst measles year in more than three decades.",
      "All but eight states have logged at least one measles case this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 47 outbreaks this year, compared with 16 in 2024. Three people \u2014 two of them Texas school children \u2014 have died.",
      "Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt Medical Center who has served as a liaison to the ACIP, told CBS News in an interview Tuesday that the \"simple answer\" behind the spread of the outbreaks is that \"parents are withholding their children from vaccination.\"",
      "\"You know, vaccination is so very effective that ... by comprehensively vaccinating all of our children, eliminated measles from the United States,\" Schaffner said, later adding that \"we are turning the clock back.\"",
      "The combined MMR vaccine is safe and provides 97% protection against the disease after two doses,\u00a0according to\u00a0the CDC. Most children in the U.S. are required to get the MMR shot to attend school. But vaccination rates have declined as more parents waive the shots or have fallen behind on recommended vaccination schedules.",
      "In September, the CDC's vaccine recommendation committee voted to recommend that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, or MMRV, be separated into MMR and varicella shots for children under the age of 4.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the change after undergoing a complete overhaul by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. Several of those new members have a history of being vaccine skeptics.",
      "According to CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, while the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related \"febrile\" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between the ages of 14-18 months.\u00a0Gounder says that while febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, they are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines.",
      "Studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window, Gounder says.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and members of his Cabinet defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published a lengthy piece featuring her blunt assessment of the president's inner circle, his first year in office and the president himself.",
      "The two-part story, written by author Chris Whipple, features quotes from 11 interviews that Whipple conducted with Wiles from Jan. 11 to Nov. 5.",
      "According to Vanity Fair, Wiles said the president, who doesn't drink, has \"an alcoholic's personality.\"",
      "\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" Wiles said, according to Vanity Fair. \"And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\" Wiles was quoted as saying the president operates with the view that there's \"nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.\"",
      "The president told the New York Post he hadn't read the Vanity Fair piece, but said Wiles is \"fantastic.\" Mr. Trump also defended Wiles' description of him.",
      "\"No, she meant that I'm \u2014 you see, I don't drink alcohol,\" the president told the Post. \"So everybody knows that \u2014 but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that \u2014 what's the word? Not possessive \u2014 possessive and addictive type personality. Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"",
      "Wiles was also quoted as saying Vice President JD Vance has \"been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" and that Attorney General Pam Bondi \"completely whiffed\" on her handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Elon Musk and the way the U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered in the early months of the administration.",
      "\"No rational person could think the USAID process was a good one,\" she said in the story. \"Nobody.\"",
      "In a post on X, her first in more than a year, Wiles, 68, called the story a \"disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she wrote. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Wiles' statement did not deny that she was accurately quoted. CBS News has asked Vanity Fair for any additional comment and whether the publication will be releasing a transcript or audio of the interviews.",
      "Wiles, a longtime political operative in Florida, became the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff when Mr. Trump took office in January. She was named to Forbes' 2025 list of the World's Most Powerful Women earlier this month.",
      "Top administration officials came to Wiles' defense after the Vanity Fair story was published, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reposting many of their comments.",
      "Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, whom Wiles called a \"right-wing absolute zealot\" in the story, called Wiles \"an exceptional chief of staff.\"",
      "\"In my portfolio, she is always an ally in helping me deliver for the president,\" Vought wrote on X. \"And this hit piece will not slow us down.\"",
      "Despite Wiles' criticism of her handling of the Epstein files, Bondi wrote on X: \"My dear friend Susie Wiles fights every day to advance President Trump's agenda \u2013 and she does so with grace, loyalty, and historic effectiveness. Any attempt to divide this administration will fail. Any attempt to undermine and downplay President Trump's monumental achievements will fail. We are family. We are united.\"",
      "\"This is what the Left does: trash & smear our best & most effective people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. \"They do it to President Trump daily \u2014 and now to Chief Susie Wiles. Susie is the most TRUSTED, most PROFESSIONAL & most EFFECTIVE Chief of Staff of my lifetime. Absolutely nobody better!\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that the \"radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump's team,\" adding that \"It won't work because we know & love Susie Wiles.\"",
      "The vice president was asked about the \"conspiracy theorist\" comment by reporters during a trip to Pennsylvania. Vance said he hadn't read the article yet but had heard about it.",
      "\"Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,\" Vance said.",
      "\"And by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time,\" Vance continued. \"For example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask three-year-olds at the height of the COVID pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.\"",
      "He added: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets.\"",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Hyundai and Kia owners can get free repairs under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.",
      "The settlement comes after a rash of Hyundai and Kia thefts prompted nearly two dozen state attorneys general in 2023 to demand the automakers take action.",
      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Recently released emails document Jeffrey Epstein's involvement in Leon Black's personal affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Documents released by Congress shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein's role in an attempt to help billionaire Leon Black squelch an accusation of sexual impropriety.",
      "Epstein's relationship with Black has already faced extensive scrutiny, but recently released, previously unreported emails from the House Oversight Committee document Epstein's involvement in Black's personal affairs while the private equity investor paid him huge sums for wealth management advice.",
      "Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, had a six-year affair with a former Russian model named Guzel Ganieva, whom he met at a party in New York City in 2008, according to court records. It was a relationship that ended in acrimony, with Ganieva accusing Black of sexual abuse \u2014 allegations Black denies.",
      "As Black prepared a nondisclosure agreement to secure Ganieva's silence about their affair, Epstein offered him some advice. Epstein suggested in a Sept. 21, 2015, email that Black hire former law enforcement officers to approach Ganieva about the agreement.",
      "\"Choose method of message delivery, my choice. - two highly respected former ---- fill in the blank, immigration, scotland yard. sfo. . who may knock on her door and present the terms,\" Epstein wrote in his typical email style, forsaking standard grammar and punctuation.",
      "Black had learned that Ganieva was planning to travel from London to New York to confront him. And Epstein suggested a similar approach if she showed up stateside. \"Have the same types of individuals [available] in new york if she decides to return as stated.. i prefer former fbi, or immigration one man one woman.\"",
      "Epstein did not mention Ganieva by name, but details in the email make it clear he's referring to her. A spokesperson for Black did not dispute that conclusion. An attorney for Ganieva declined to comment.",
      "Epstein penned a follow-up email minutes later, giving Black's assistant and attorney further instructions. Epstein wrote that Black's assistant \"should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an apollo server.\"",
      "No other emails in the trove released by Congress appear to address Black's long-running dispute with Ganieva.",
      "Ernest Badway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney who frequently represents clients in internal investigations, said an exchange of this nature should have set off red flags inside his company when they later looked into Black's ties to Epstein.",
      "\"As an investigator, that would concern me if I saw an email that people sent on the business's server saying, 'set up a private email so we can have private conversations.' You know, what are those private conversations about?\" Badway said.",
      "Epstein spent years forging relationships that bridged his business interests with his connections to international law enforcement and intelligence figures \u2014 including some powerful players in Russia. He engaged in transactions with Russian banks involving hundreds of millions of dollars, a congressional investigator, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, said in July. He frequently met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, until Churkin's death in 2017. And he nurtured a relationship with former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov \u2014 a reputed FSB agent.",
      "In the summer of 2015, Epstein reached out to Belyakov for information on Ganieva to determine whether she was working for the Russian government, according to The Dossier Center, a website run by former Russian oligarch and Putin critic Mikhail Kordokovsky.",
      "On Oct. 18, 2015, Ganieva signed a nondisclosure contract with Black in which the billionaire agreed to pay her $100,000 monthly for 15 years, forgive a $1 million loan and provide two million British pounds for her to obtain legal status in the U.K.",
      "Two months later, Epstein emailed Black seeking additional payments for his financial advice.",
      "\"As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done ( both known and some things that will need (sp) to remain unknown.)\" Epstein wrote.",
      "The nondisclosure agreement broke down four years later, leading to a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Court filings show Black discussed Ganieva's deal with two people, Epstein and a private investigator. It's unclear if Black turned to the private investigator \u2014 who had spent decades working for the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 because Epstein had suggested hiring ex-law enforcement.",
      "Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, told CBS News that his relationship with Epstein has already been the subject of an internal investigation commissioned by Apollo, and conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP.",
      "\"Epstein's emails, to which Mr. Black never responded, make it clear that Epstein was a braggart who embellished and exaggerated his role and responsibilities in many ways,\" Estrich said. \"Mr. Black's consensual relationship with Ms. Ganieva ended with an amicable settlement in 2015 and a voluntary non-disclosure agreement. Ms. Ganieva's unfounded lawsuit against Mr. Black has been dismissed by the trial court and that decision was upheld on appeal.\"",
      "The Dechert investigation concluded that Black paid Epstein $158 million for work related to his family office, \"and that Black genuinely believed that Epstein was extremely smart, capable, and saved him substantial amounts of money.\" The Dechert report made no mention of any effort by Epstein to advise Black regarding Ganieva \u2014 only that Black had \"confided\" in Epstein about certain personal matters.",
      "\"Mr. Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and Dechert investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents and concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice, no more, no less,\" Estrich said.",
      "It's unclear if the two emails about Ganieva were among those turned over to Dechert's investigators. The Dechert investigation was led by Andrew Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Levander, who also represented former CBS CEO Les Moonves when he was the focus of an internal investigation in 2018, declined to comment.",
      "Black stepped down from the company he founded in March 2021, citing health concerns, two months after the Dechert report was finalized.",
      "Sen. Wyden \u2014 who has spent nearly four years investigating the financial relationship between Black and Epstein \u2014 says Black's payments to Epstein actually reached $170 million and he does not believe the emerging picture matches Black's explanation for paying Epstein nine-figure \"fees\" for tax advice.",
      "\"All along Mr. Black's story has been that he, a multi-billionaire Wall Street titan who employed the finest tax and estate planning minds in America, had to pay astronomical rates for special tax advice from Jeffrey Epstein, who was neither a tax attorney nor an accountant,\" Wyden told CBS News. \"I've never found Black's account believable, and every new revelation in this case raises more troubling questions about what really motivated his payments to Epstein and whether previous investigations of this matter covered up the truth.\"",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to reflect that the nondisclosure agreement between Black and Ganieva only sought confidentiality about their affair.",

      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",

    "summary": "Ahmed al Ahmed, the Syrian-Australian father who wrestled a shotgun from one of the gunmen attacking a Jewish gathering, is facing a long road to recovery.",
    "story": [
      "Like many Australians strolling at Bondi Beach on long, warm summer evenings, Ahmed al Ahmed just wanted a cup of coffee with a friend. Around him, a bloody massacre erupted as two gunmen targeted Jews during Hanukkah festivities at a park close to the shore.",
      "Soon al Ahmed was creeping, bent over, between two parked cars, before barreling directly toward one of the unsuspecting shooters. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the 44-year-old father can be seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker.",
      "The story of the Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner who put an end to the rampage of one of the shooters on Sunday has been seized upon by a country desperately seeking comfort after one of its darkest hours: the slaying of 15 people as they celebrated their Jewish faith.",
      "\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday, as he left a Sydney hospital where al Ahmed is being treated for gunshot wounds. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",
      "A fundraising page established by Australians who had never met al Ahmed had attracted by Tuesday night donations by some 40,000 people, who gave 2.3 million Australian dollars ($1.5 million). Among the supporters was the billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who pledged AU$99,000.",
      "Al Ahmed, who is married with two young daughters, faces a long struggle ahead, those who have spoken to him since Sunday's massacre say. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman in the attack as the man fired indiscriminately from a footbridge.",
      "He has already undergone surgery and more operations are scheduled, said Lubaba alhmidi Alkahil, a spokesperson for the Australians for Syria Association, who visited al Ahmed in a hospital late Monday. The \"quiet and humble\" man was conscious but frail and faced at least six months of recovery, Alkahil said.",
      "Under Australia's national, tax-funded health care system, Al Ahmed, who is a permanent legal resident of the country, is unlikely to face any bills for his care.",
      "In the days since the attack, a pile of floral tributes and notes of thanks has grown outside the small convenience store al Ahmed owns opposite a train station in suburban Sydney. Meanwhile, he has received visits at the hospital from Australia's leaders, apparently telling Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, that he'd take the same action again.",
      "He has been hailed as a hero by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia's Governor General, who is the representative of Britain's King Charles in the country. Minns said al Ahmed saved \"countless\" lives in what the premier said was \"the most unbelievable scene I've ever seen.\"",
      "Al Ahmed lived in the town of Nayrab in Syria's Idlib region before he arrived in Australia, his cousin Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. He left Syria in 2006 after finishing his studies, before the 2011 mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad that were met with a brutal crackdown and spiraled into a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "Nayrab was heavily bombed by Assad's forces with most of the town's houses flattened and reduced to rubble. On Tuesday, al Ahmed was the talk of the town.",
      "\"Ahmed did really a heroic job,\" his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. \"Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.\"",
      "Ahmed al Ahmed's parents, who came to Sydney this year to reunite with their son, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that their son had served with the police and in the central security forces in Syria. Father Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said his son's \"conscience and soul\" compelled him to act on Sunday.",
      "\"I feel pride and honor because my son is a hero of Australia,\" the father said.",
      "In the aftermath of the mass killing, a country roiling from one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever on its soil - allegedly committed by an Australian resident who arrived from India in 1998 and his Australian-born son - looked for hope amid their grief.",
      "Other stories of heroism have also emerged.",
      "They included the tale of a married couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were both killed while trying to stop one of the shooters as he climbed from his car and began the massacre, their family has told Australian news outlets.",
      "\"Bondi locals, together they lived honest, hardworking lives and treated everyone they met with kindness, warmth and respect,\" the family said in a statement. \"Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void.\"",
      "Reuven Morrison, 62, was also killed while trying to stop the horror, according to his daughter, Sheina Gutnick. After al Ahmed wrestled the gun from one shooter, Morrison can be seen throwing objects at the gunman - before he was shot by the second man.",
      "\"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members,\" Gutnick told CBS News earlier this week.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/arctic-temperatures-climate-change-noaa-report/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 10:02:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of mourners gathered Wednesday at a synagogue in Sydney for the first of the 15 funerals for those killed in Sunday's terrorist attack on Jewish people gathered to mark the start of Hanukkah on Australia's Bondi Beach.",
      "Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, the assistant rabbi at the local Chabad-Lubavitch of Bondi, who had helped to organize what started out as a joyous event on the famous beach, was the first to be mourned on Wednesday.",
      "The funeral took place just a few blocks from where he and other members of Sydney's tight-knit Jewish community were gunned down.",
      "After sharp criticism over what many saw as lax security for the Sunday event, there was a heavy police presence around the synagogue on Wednesday. Officers were seen checking the identification of those heading toward the funeral.",
      "\"He was an angel,\" Rabbi Moshe Gutnick told CBS News as Schlanger's body was transported. \"He was goodness personified. Everything that he did was about doing good for people.\"",
      "\"He was the heart and soul of the synagogue,\" he added. \"We are all going to miss him terribly.\"",
      "Gutnick's brother-in-law, 62-year-old Reuven Morrison, was also among those killed on Sunday, as he hurled stones at one of the attackers, Morrison's daughter told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "Given how close the community is, Rabbi Gutnick said he would be attending funerals in the coming days, \"not once, not twice but many more times.\"",
      "\"It's just one after the other after the other. It's our 7th of October,\" he added, referring to the Hamas-led terror attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza two years ago.",
      "Some family members and friends were unable to contain their sorrow during the service for Schlanger on Wednesday, speaking through tears to pay homage to the father of five, whose youngest was born just seven weeks before he was killed.",
      "\"After what happened, my biggest regret was - apart from the obvious \u2013 I could have done more to tell Eli more often how much we love him, how much I love him, how much we appreciate everything that he does and how proud we are of him,\" said his father-in-law, Rabbi Yehoram Ulman.",
      "Investigations into the shooting continued, meanwhile.",

    "story": [
      "The father and son suspects in the terror attack on Jewish people gathered for a Hanukkah event in Bondi Beach, Australia, spent most of November in the Philippines, police said Tuesday. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, meanwhile, that the attack was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
      "New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went between Nov. 1 and 28. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, and his 24-year-old son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, had listed the southern city of Davao as their final destination on the trip.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC reported the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Asian nation, citing security sources.",
      "Philippine officials denied it. Presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "\"People have traveled and networked amongst these groups, but very, very rarely,\" Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News. \"And this is often overblown.\"",
      "The Philippines' history with Islamist insurgency",
      "Islamist separatists have operated in the southern Philippines for decades \u2014 it's \"an insurgency which is almost 100 years in the making,\" according to Smith.",
      "He said two longstanding militant groups \u2014 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, known as the MILF, and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF \u2014 have been \"sort of the grandfather, old rebellious groups of the Islamist movement\" in the Philippines.",
      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the country.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

      "Authorities also revealed that gunmen had recently returned from the Philippines, where they traveled to an area known as a hotbed for terrorist groups.",
      "The mass shooting on the famous beach left 15 innocent people dead, including a 10-year-old girl and an Holocaust survivor. The attack was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" Albanese said Tuesday as he visited one of the heroes who tried to stop the attackers.",
      "Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett also said Tuesday that it was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" referring to the now disparate group that, for several years, held a huge swathe of territory spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "The suspects, a father and son aged 50 and 24, used guns that were owned legally by the older man, whom officials in New South Wales state have named as Sajid Akram. He was shot dead at the scene, and his son was still being treated in a hospital on Tuesday, where he had regained consciousness.",
      "Police said Wednesday that the younger man was charged with 59 offenses including 15 counts of murder and one of terrorism.",
      "Indian police confirm father was from Hyderabad",
      "Police in the southern Indian state of Telangana confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Sajid Akram was originally from the city of Hyderabad. In a statement, the police said he earned a degree in Hyderabad before migrating to Australia in November 1998, where he married a woman of European origin.",
      "Sajid Akram held an Indian passport, while his son Naveed and a daughter were both born in Australia and are citizens of the country, the police said, confirming previous statements by Australian officials about the son's nationality. U.S. officials had told CBS News soon after the attack that at least one of the Akrams was believed to be a Pakistani national, but that appears to have been a case of mistaken identity, and a man with the same name as the younger suspect has come forward in Sydney to say he was wrongly identified.",
      "The Telangana police said the elder Akram had \"limited contact with his family in Hyderabad over the past 27 years,\" visiting six times since he migrated to Australia, \"primarily for family-related reasons.\"",
      "The police statement said family members in India had \"expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalization, and that the son's apparent radicalization appeared \"to have no connection with India.\"",
      "Australian officials have confirmed that homemade ISIS flags were found \u2014   along with an improvised explosive device \u2014   in the suspects' vehicle at Bondi Beach on Sunday, and police provided new information on Tuesday about their recent movements.",
      "Suspected gunmen spent most of November in the Philippines",
      "Both men traveled to the Philippines in November, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters on Tuesday, adding that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went.",
      "The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said both Sajid Akram and his son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, spent most of November \u2014 from the 1st until the 28th \u2014   in the Philippines, and listing the city of Davao as their final destination.",
      "Muslim separatists, including the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group that once publicly backed ISIS, are active in that part of the southern Philippines. ABC, the Australian public broadcaster, said the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But Philippines presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "That group and others in the region have drawn and trained some foreign militants from across Asia, the Middle East and Europe in the past, according to the Associated Press, though Abu Sayyaf has been weakened in recent years by repeated military offensives.",
      "The AP cited Philippine military and police officials as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Did Australian officials fail the Jewish community?",
      "Australian officials confirmed Monday that Naveed Akram was under investigation for about six months during 2019 for suspected links to a Sydney-based terror cell, though the nation's primary spy agency found he represented no threat, and officials said the probe had focused on associates.",
      "Australia's ABC network\u00a0reported that his ties included \"longstanding links\" to members of a pro-ISIS cell in Australia, including contact with alleged jihadist spiritual leader Wisam Haddad and a man named Youssef Uweinat, who was convicted of recruiting young people in Australia to Islamic extremism.",
      "A lawyer for Haddad has denied that the cleric had \"any knowledge of or involvement in the shootings that took place at Bondi Beach,\" according to the network.",
      "Many people, from the daughter of one of the victims, to a former Australian leader, have told CBS News the men's history should have raised serious red flags, if not stopped them before they claimed so many lives.",
      "Israeli officials have harshly criticized Australia's government for failing to protect Jewish people amid a sharp rise in recent years of antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We are now facing here a surge of antisemitism, and Australians of Jewish faith are not feeling secure in their own country, and this is insane,\" Israeli Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon told CBS News on Tuesday, urging Australian leaders to create opportunities for young people of different faiths to come together, \"and not once a year, but on a weekly basis.\"",
      "Maimon also said \"boundaries should be set\" by Australian authorities, referring to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been held in the country.",
      "\"I believe that it's very important to make sure that while the principle of freedom of expression should be kept, there should be also a limit to the language that some protesters, and in some protests, we hear,\" he said. \"I always believe that there is room to do more. Always. I'm asking myself every day, 'what can I do better? How can I do better?' And I'm trying to do it. And I do expect the Australian government to do better.\"",
      "Former Australian leader says there are no easy answers",
      "Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told CBS News on Tuesday that the national government undoubtedly had some very big questions to answer, but he stressed that intelligence gathering \u2014 for all nations \u2014 is an imperfect science.",
      "\"This type of terrorism has been, the elements of that, have been present in Australia for a long time, and our agencies spend a lot of time keeping an eye on them, but it's hard to track every single person,\" said Turnbull, who was Australian prime minister from 2015 to 2018.",
      "\"Certainly, it's a very big question: Why does somebody living in the suburbs of Sydney need six long arms, as he [Sajid Akram] had, even though they were licensed? Second question is, why were they licensed to a man who had a son who had been on an ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organization] watchlist because of links to ISIS-related entities? \u00a0\u2026 And that trip to the Philippines raises another question: Why were they there? And so, you know, this gets back to the problem that I think we face all around the world, is databases talking to each other? Are we actually putting all the dots together in time?\"",
      "\"There are holes in everybody's intelligence gathering,\" Turnbull said. \"But as you know, the terrorist only has to be right once. The security agencies have to be right every time.\"",
      "Regarding the sharp criticism levelled by many in the Jewish community, in particular, over perceived failings in detecting the threat posed by the suspects, and also in sufficiently protecting the pre-planned Jewish event on Bondi Beach, Turnbull said he wasn't sure how much more could have been done by his successor Albanese.",
      "\"I've been prime minister, right? And I'm on the opposite side of politics, so I'm not trying to be partisan about this, but I struggle to see what he could have done that was different. I mean there have been people saying he shouldn't have allowed pro-Palestine marches. Well, you know, we do have freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Australia. I mean we have restrictions in Australia on speech, on hate speech, and on guns, in particular.\"",
      "\"When I ask people, they will say he should have condemned antisemitism more often. Well, I've never heard him do anything other than condemn it, but my question really is to say, what would difference would that have made? To those terrorists, you know, they're not going to listen to a lecture on the evils of antisemitism from you or me or Anthony Albanese.\"",
      "\"Remember, terrorism is a political act, right? So, you've got to try to interrupt people being radicalized, particularly young men, it's the most vulnerable group, and that involves monitoring what is being said online, what they're being taught, you know, in schools or in mosques or in other places.

      "President Trump on Tuesday called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela, as the administration heaps pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro at sea and leaves the door open for possible land strikes.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment. The Pentagon referred CBS News to the White House.",
      "Last week, the U.S. military seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News. Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump's Tuesday night announcement suggests that further seizures are possible. It's not clear how many vessels are covered by the planned blockade.",
      "The Maduro government called last week's boat seizure \"robbery\" and \"piracy.\" In a statement late Tuesday, Venezuela called the blockade a \"grotesque threat\" and a violation of international law, and accused the Trump administration of seeking to \"appropriate the oil, land and minerals of the country through gigantic campaigns of lies and manipulations.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes any future boat seizures are unlikely to lead to increases in global oil prices, he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0over the weekend. He didn't specify whether a total blockade was on the table, but said the administration is trying to crack down on a \"black market for oil.\"",
      "Venezuela is a major oil producer with some of the world's largest petroleum reserves. But its oil industry has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for years, with the Biden and Trump administrations citing human rights concerns and widespread allegations of fraud in Venezuela's last two elections.",
      "Heavily sanctioned oil producers like Venezuela, Russia and Iran have sought to export their oil despite the U.S. restrictions, in some cases allegedly turning to a global \"shadow fleet\" of older oil tankers with questionable registrations \u2014 a move that has\u00a0vexed\u00a0federal authorities.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he has ramped up economic pressure on Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of colluding with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has denied those allegations.",
      "Last week, the administration sanctioned six ships accused of carrying oil from Venezuela, along with three nephews of Maduro, two of whom were accused of narcotics trafficking and one of whom worked for the country's state oil company.",
      "Late Tuesday, Mr. Trump alleged in a social media post that the Maduro regime was using oil exports to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration has\u00a0taken steps to designate the Cartel de los Soles \u2014 a loosely organized group it says is led by Maduro \u2014 as a foreign terrorist organization. And Maduro himself faces a $50 million reward for his capture, after he was\u00a0charged with narco-trafficking in U.S. federal court in 2020.",
      "Venezuela has also faced pressure from the U.S. military, which has moved naval vessels and fighter jets into the Caribbean and conducted strikes against at least 25 boats it claims were trafficking drugs from Latin America.",
      "And Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested\u00a0he may order strikes on land-based drug targets in Venezuela and other countries, which would mark a significant escalation.",
      "Maduro's government has decried the military buildup, accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change, and vowed to defend itself against any military operations.",
      "The U.S. president has not said explicitly whether he's seeking Maduro's ouster, but he told Politico last week the Venezuelan leader's \"days are numbered.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "story": [
      "A missing woman's phone was found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness over the weekend, more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
      "An independent search party organized by Celine Cremer's friends and family found her phone on Saturday at a waterfall, Tasmania Police said in a statement. It was the first sign of Cremer ever located in the area where she went missing, aside from her car, which investigators discovered 10 days after the last confirmed sighting of her in Waratah, a town in the Australian island state of Tasmania.",
      "Tasmania Police said the phone will undergo further forensic examination and that they will now formally join the independent search for Cremer.",
      "Cremer, a Belgian woman, was last seen on June 17, 2023, in Waratah, according to police. Investigators believe that Cremer drove to Philosopher Falls, a waterfall surrounded by dense rainforest, and intended to set out for a short walk through the area.",
      "\"Unfortunately, she did not return,\" Tasmania Police inspector Andrew Hanson said in a statement.",
      "Her friends reported her disappearance to Tasmania Police on June 26, 2023, and the original search effort began the next day, police said.",
      "By then, the area had already experienced an intense spell of winter weather, including subzero temperatures, snow and rainfall. According to Hanson, medical experts at the time advised police that Cremer could not have survived so many days in the wilderness under those conditions.",
      "The initial search continued for two weeks, with no clues as to where Cremer might be, and follow-up searches over the years ended similarly. The recent discovery of Cremer's phone suggests that she may have veered off course during her walk around Philosopher Falls and lost her way.",
      "\"The phone was found in an area that has been extensively searched previously and phone data, as well as the location it was found, supports our theory that Celine may have, using an app on her phone, elected to leave the Philosopher Falls track to take more a direct route back to her car as daylight faded,\" said Hanson, adding: \"We suspect she dropped her phone and continued without it, becoming disoriented in dense terrain.\"",
      "A bout of harsh winter weather over the weekend postponed further search efforts, according to Tasmania Police, but Hanson said they planned to dispatch officers to the area as soon as those conditions cleared up.",
      "Police said that while they were not leading or coordinating the search that led to the phone's discovery, they \"had been supporting the effort by sharing information and advice about what to do should anything be discovered.\"",
      "The independent group of searchers included Cremer's friends and the adventure filmmaker Rob Parsons, who has posted videos of his own private attempts to search for Cremer on YouTube. He described the moment Cremer's phone was discovered in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "\"I don't think there was a dry eye in the area,\" Parsons told the news organization. \"Everyone was so emotional. Everything was building up to this point where her friends could be here for the discovery. It felt like it was meant to be.\"",

      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC said Tuesday that it would defend itself in court after President Trump sued the British public broadcaster for defamation and violating Florida state practices law in relation to a documentary that edited together separate parts of his Jan. 6, 2021 speech in Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump is seeking $10 billion in damages with his lawsuit, filed Monday in the Southern District of Florida.",
      "In its statement, the BBC said it would \"be defending this case,\" but would not be commenting further on the ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "In his complaint, Mr. Trump's attorneys accuse the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in the BBC documentary that aired in the U.K. a week before the 2024 election.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC, \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips from the same speech Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before rioters overran the Capitol building. The two portions of the speech that were stuck together in the documentary were actually delivered by Mr. Trump nearly an hour apart, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The complaint accuses the BBC of violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, \"by engaging in unfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices and/or unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the documentary, issued an apology, and \"appropriately\" compensated him.",
      "In November, the BBC issued an apology and published a retraction, but said in a statement that it \"strongly disagree[s] that there's a basis for a deflation claim.\"",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in November. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "BBC Director-General Tim Davie and the network's head of news Deborah Turness both resigned over the controversy.",

      "Stephens said Mr. Trump's legal team, even if they won their suit against the BBC, would not get a $10 billion settlement.",
      "\"The BBC is a very much a hand-to-mouth kind of organization. It doesn't have profits. It doesn't have shareholders. So literally any money is going to come from the British taxpayers, and I think they'll feel pretty badly about paying President Trump for a court case of this kind,\" Stephens said.",
      "The U.K. has \"a law which essentially does not recognize what we call 'punitive damages' \u2014 damages that intend to punish,\" Stephens said. \"In the U.K., the maximum compensatory damages he would be entitled to is $300,000 U.S. dollars. So even if he got, say, a million or $2 million at court, the British courts would only enforce $300,000.\"",

      "Zelenskyy warned late Monday that a draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin earlier in the day had not resolved some key issues, notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by invading Russian forces.",
      "U.S-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.",
      "If Ukraine seeks \"momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"We want peace - we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,\" he told reporters. \"We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.\"",
      "American officials on Monday said that there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. President Trump said, \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever\" to a peace settlement.",
      "Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, however.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either.",
      "\"The Americans are trying to find a compromise,\" Zelenskyy said before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. \"They are proposing a 'free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a 'free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The land issue remains one of the most difficult obstacles to a comprehensive agreement.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense. Kyiv would seek enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons if diplomacy collapses, he said.",
      "Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.",
      "U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks. \"We are at a major moment in this war. The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war,\" he said at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.",
      "Zelenskyy was also positive about the talks.",
      "\"Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,\" he said. \"It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking at the launch of the International Claims Commission for Ukraine in The Hague Tuesday, Zelenskyy added: \"As long as our people remain in Russian captivity and until the Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are brought home, sanctions must limit Russia, until it shows respect for peaceful for peaceful life and the rights of its neighbors. And of course, of course, every Russian war crime must have consequences for those who committed them.\"",

    "story": [
      "A judge sentenced a Sydney taekwondo instructor on Tuesday to life in prison without possibility of release for murdering a 7-year-old student and the boy's parents.",
      "Kwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.",
      "The former instructor, who was called Master Lion by his students, did not look at the victims' family as they cried in court, 9News Australia reported. He held a Bible stuffed with notes during the sentencing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.",
      "Harrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family's financial success.",
      "\"I'm satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,\" Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.",
      "Harrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.",
      "\"These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion or consideration for the dignity of the Cho family,\" Harrison said, according to news.au.",
      "State law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy's parents also can't be named.",
      "Yoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.",
      "Yoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.",
      "Yoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion's Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.",
      "He took the mother's Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy's 39-year-old father to death.",
      "Yoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to a hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.",
      "After his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family's money and later detailed his remorse.",
      "While the crimes were planned \u2014 with Yoo surveilling the family's home beforehand \u2014 he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.",
      "The judge heard Yoo had lied about qualifying for the 2000 Olympics, owning a Lamborghini and living in Sydney's wealthy suburbs, 9News Australia reported. He would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people, in order to impress his wife, the outlet reported.",
      "Harrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.",
      "\"I wanted to give her hope,\" he told his psychiatrist, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. \"However, over time it became bigger and bigger and didn't stop. She was so happy.\"",
      "The judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.",
      "Yoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.",
      "In a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was \"held captive by sin\" and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.",
      "\"I wish I could turn back time so this didn't happen,\" Yoo wrote. \"I pray every day for the people I have hurt.\"",
      "Yoo's lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

    "summary": "A 50-year-old suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting was shot and killed by police and his 24-year-old son, who was investigated previously, is in a coma.",
    "story": [
      "Two suspected gunmen accused of killing 15 people and injuring dozens during a Hanukkah celebration in Australia have been identified as a father and a son, authorities said. The younger man was reportedly investigated years ago over suspected links to an ISIS cell in Sydney, and Australian officials confirmed Tuesday afternoon local time that two homemade ISIS flags were discovered in a vehicle registered to him.",
      "The shooting was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "The 50-year-old father, identified by police as Sajid Akram, was shot and killed by police, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the 24-year-old son remained hospitalized in a coma.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon has said, without going into further details.",
      "The 24-year-old suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, according to U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the investigation. CBS News has also reviewed Naveed Akram's New South Wales driver's license. Authorities said Sunday they had identified the father as a licensed gun owner.",
      "The officials had told CBS News that Naveed Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from. At the news conference on Tuesday local time, Lanyon also confirmed reports that the two alleged gunmen traveled to the Philippines last month. The exact location and purpose of the trip are under investigation, he said.",
      "Lanyon has said investigators recovered six of the suspect's licensed firearms at the scene. He initially said the older suspect had had a gun license for about 10 years, but confirmed Tuesday that the application lapsed in 2016. However, a second license was applied for in 2020 and eventually issued in 2023, meaning the older suspect was licensed appropriately at the time of the shooting, according to the police commissioner.",
      "The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon has said.",
      "In addition to two homemade ISIS flags found in Naveed Akram's vehicle, improvised explosive devices were also recovered, police said Tuesday.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" Lanyon said.",
      "Prime Minister Albanese confirmed that the younger suspect had been under investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Agency (ASIO), the country's primary spy agency, for about six months during 2019.",
      "According to public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp., ASIO looked into the son's possible ties to a cell of the ISIS terrorist organization in Sydney. Albanese didn't go into detail, but had said that ASIO had been focused on individuals believed to be in that cell who were associated with the son, rather than the son himself.",
      "\"He was examined on the basis of being associated with others, and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence,\" the prime minister said.",
      "During an earlier news conference, Australian police said they were looking for a potential third suspect, but Lanyon later confirmed that was no longer the case.",
      "More than 1,000 people were gathered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Sunday. Albanese said the gunmen were \"deliberately targeting the Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah.\"",
      "The attack at the popular beach left at least 40 people injured, including two officers and three children, Australian officials said.",
      "Also among the injured is 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, who had been shot after he confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled the weapon away, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "One video\u00a0posted to social media shows al Ahmed jump out from behind a parked car along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, tackle one of the suspects who had just fired his gun, and wrestle the weapon away.",
      "President Trump, during an event at the White House on Sunday, said al Ahmed's actions \"saved a lot of lives.\"",
      "Anna Schecter, Emily Mae Czachor, Archie Clarke and Sam Vinograd contributed to this report, which has been updated to reflect Australian authorities saying the younger suspect is Australian-born.\u00a0Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

      "The U.S. military says it struck three more alleged drug-carrying boats in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, the latest in a campaign of vessel strikes ordered by the Trump administration that have killed at least 95 people in 25 boats.",
      "Monday's strikes killed eight men across three boats, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a post on X. It alleged the occupants were \"male narco-terrorists\" and the boats were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and were engaged in narco-trafficking.\" The strike was authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Southern Command said.",
      "Southern Command also posted a 47-second video that appeared to show three separate strikes on vessels.",

      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including a child and two officers, according to police. Two of the suspects were identified as a father and a son, according to Mal Lanyon, the police commissioner of New South Wales.",
      "The 50-year-old father was killed, and the son \u2014 identified as 24-year-old Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police \u2014 was in custody in critical but stable condition, Lanyon said.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" Lanyon said in a separate update Sunday, but didn't go into further details.",
      "Australian officials and international leaders have condemned it as an antisemitic terrorist attack.",
      "Police said they expect the death toll to climb. Here is what we know so far.",
      "Gunfire broke out at a Hanukkah celebration",
      "The attack took place during a Jewish holiday celebration held to mark the first day of Hanukkah. More than 1,000 people were on the beach, in a suburb of Sydney, when shots rang out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon, who officially declared the shooting a \"terrorist incident.\"",
      "Numerous Australian officials have characterized the shooting as targeted. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah \u2014 which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith \u2014 an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism, that has struck the heart of our nation,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference.",
      "Video footage recorded by civilians showed frightened crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area as gunshots went off in the background.",
      "Neither officials nor police have identified the victims of the attack. Chabad, a global organization representing a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said Rabbi Eli Schlanger, with Chabad of Bondi, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, according to the organization.",
      "2 suspects identified as father and son",
      "Australian authorities said two gunmen were suspected of carrying out the deadly mass shooting, a rare occurrence in a country where gun violence is uncommon.",
      "Lanyon said the deceased suspect was previously known to the New South Wales police force. In addition to the 50-year-old gunman killed at the scene of the attack, another was hospitalized with serious injuries, he said. The surviving gunman, the 24-year-old son, has been taken into custody. The commissioner later said officers were not looking for an additional suspect.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police.",
      "Six licensed firearms were found at the scene, Lanyon said, adding that they all belong to the father. The police commissioner originally said that the older suspect had a gun licence for about 10 years. He later clarified that the father had been approved for a license in 2015, but that license lapsed after he failed to have his picture taken for the license as required by law. The father again applied for a license in 2020 and was granted one in 2023, Lanyon said. The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon said.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" he said.",

      "Good Samaritan disarmed one gunman",
      "A man has been lauded as a hero and praised by the police commissioner for tackling one suspect and disarming him in dramatic video footage recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that wraps around Bondi Beach. In the footage, the man could be seen crouched in hiding behind a parked car before wrestling the suspect and taking his weapon.",
      "Australian news outlets have identified the man seen disarming the suspect as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, citing his relatives.",
      "Al Ahmed was wounded in the attack and was set to undergo surgery Wednesday at St. George Hospital, according to Albanese. Albanese did not give further details on al Ahmed's condition, but said he met with him and family members, including al Ahmed's parents, on Tuesday to thank him for the lives he saved and wish him well.",
      "Officers found explosive devices, homemade ISIS flags",
      "Shortly after the shooting took place, officers who responded to the scene discovered a vehicle along Campbell Parade and believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside of it, Lanyon said. The vehicle was linked to the younger gunman, according to the police commissioner.",
      "Lanyon said at a press conference Tuesday that the vehicle also contained two homemade ISIS flags.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Although Australia rarely experiences mass shootings, after implementing stringent gun reform laws in the wake of a deadly 1996 massacre in Tasmania's Port Arthur, antisemitic incidents have been on the rise in the country since the war in Gaza began in 2023.",
      "The Australian government appointed special envoys in 2024 to address spiking antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia, in its communities. But attacks still happened this year. One, in July, involved an arsonist who set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, while worshippers were inside.",

    "summary": "Sheina Gutnick's dad came to Australia to escape persecution for his Jewish faith, and his murder in Bondi has left her feeling \"betrayed by the government.\"",
    "story": [
      "The daughter of one of the victims of Sunday's Bondi Beach terror attack told CBS News on Monday that her father was \"shot dead for being Jewish,\" and she now believes Australia is not a safe home for Jewish people.",
      "Sheina Gutnick said that her father, Reuven Morrison, a 62-year-old Soviet-born member of the ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Australia, was killed while attempting to stop one of the two gunmen during Sunday's mass shooting, which Australian authorities have called an antisemitic terror attack.",
      "\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" Gutnick told CBS News in Bondi on Monday, referencing an attempt to stop one of the gunmen that was caught on camera during the attack the previous day.",
      "She said it was her father seen trying to stop one of the assailants after another man, later identified as 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, confronted the suspect and wrestled a gun away from him.",
      "\"I believe after Ahmed managed to get the gun off the terrorist, my father had then gone to try and unjam the gun, to try and attempt shooting. He was screaming at the terrorist,\" she said. \"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members.\"",
      "Dramatic social media video verified by CBS News Confirmed shows Morrison throwing objects at one of the suspected shooters after another man, confirmed by Australian authorities as Ahmed, tackled and disarmed him.",
      "Gutnick recalled the devastating moment that she found out her father had been killed in the attack.",
      "\"As my family was exiting a Hanukkah event in Melbourne we heard news from a friend that there was a shooting happening in Sydney. I immediately felt the biggest pit in my stomach and tried calling my father who did not pick up the phone. I then called my mother and I heard screaming, shouting. She was screaming that there's an active shooter,\" Gutnick said. \"I called her back and she was yelling that he's running, he's running, and then that he has been shot. After a few more attempts of hanging up and calling back, my mother was yelling for medical assistance, screaming for an ambulance, screaming for help, asking for help ... she then advised that he's getting oxygen and hung up the phone.\"",
      "She said she managed to get her mother back on the phone, \"and she was screaming that they had stopped working on him and that he had been covered by a sheet. I was hoping in her hysterical state that she was just being delusional and that wasn't the case.\"",
      "Gutnick said that she believes Australia is no longer a safe country for the Jewish community, and she blamed the country's government, accusing leaders of failing to address a rising tide of antisemitism.",
      "Australian police, \"lay on the ground in the grass covering their heads, untrained for this massacre, untrained for what's to come, untrained for what the Jewish community has been telling the Australian government is inevitable,\" Gutnick said, adding her voice to a chorus of criticism after a documented rise in hate attacks aimed at Australia's Jewish residents.",
      "\"Australia's not a home for Jews anymore. It can't be. If we are shot dead while celebrating our religious festival of lights, of pride, of celebrating who we are, and if we can't do that, Australia is not a house for us anymore. We can't be here,\" she added",
      "Morrison had fled the Soviet Union to escape antisemitic persecution five decades ago, Gutnick said, and said she was left with a sense of \"betrayal\" due to the manner of her father's death.",
      "\"He came to Australia because he thought that this would be safe,\" she said. \"This is where he was going to have a family, where he is going to live a life away from persecution.\"",
      "\"And for many years, he did do that \u2014 he lived a wonderful, free life \u2014   until Australia turned on him.\"",
      "\"I feel betrayed by the government. I feel the signs were coming for a long, long time. The warning bells were there, and the government sat doing nothing.\"",
      "\"The Jewish community are hurting today,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters Monday at a memorial on Bondi Beach. \"Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.\"",
      "One of the suspects, a father and son, was killed on Sunday, and the younger man \u2014   who was investigated in 2019 over suspected links to extremism but deemed to not represent a threat \u2014   remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, Albanese said.",
      "\"People's circumstances can change,\" he told reporters before a cabinet meeting on Monday. \"People can be radicalized over a period of time. [Gun] Licences should not be in perpetuity.\"",
      "\"We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said Monday.",
      "Gutnick said that she would remember her father as a hero who \"went down fighting.\"",
      "\"He added so much light into the world. There was no human on Earth you could compare him to. If there was one way for him to go from this Earth, he would be fighting a terrorist. There was no other way he would have been taken from us,\" Gutnick said.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 20:07:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on sedition charges, his daughter told reporters she hopes international pressure can spare her father.",
    "story": [
      "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a businessman and pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on national security and sedition charges, his daughter Claire Lai told reporters in Washington, D.C., she hopes international pressure can spare her father from spending the rest of his life in prison.",
      "\"We expected the verdict,\" she told CBS News. \"As much as you can expect that, you can only be so ready for it. So I am grieving.\"",
      "Lai, 78, was found guilty on three charges: one sedition charge and two charges of violating the National Security Law, a controversial Hong Kong law instituted in 2020 following pro-democracy protests in 2019. The charges were conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country and conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong that was often sharply critical of the Chinese government and its growing influence over the city. The paper closed in 2021 after police raided the newsroom, arrested reporters and froze the publication's assets. Jimmy Lai was arrested in 2020 and held in custody since.",
      "Jonathan Price, part of Jimmy Lai's international legal team, said the results of the trial were unsurprising, but argued they reflect China's reneging of commitments to the rule of law in Hong Kong and agreements made between the British and Chinese governments when Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The government in Beijing had agreed to grant Hong Kong autonomy until at least 2047, but it has increasingly exerted control over the enclave.",
      "\"It's 855 pages of obfuscation, fluff, diversion with some colorful language, but no substance,\" he told CBS News. \"It's extraordinary that a document of that length involving a case about someone who ran a press organization doesn't mention substantively, press freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to protest, or any human rights.\"",
      "Claire Lai last spoke to her father in June of this year, and said his condition has noticeably deteriorated. She described that his nails are changing colors and falling off and his teeth are rotting. She also worries about his diabetes and heart palpitations. She blames his prison conditions and solitary confinement for his deterioration.",
      "Claire Lai, her family and her legal team fear that appeals could take over 8 years and fear Jimmy Lai may not live long enough to endure the process.",
      "\"My father does not have eight years. If we wait to the end of the appeals process, there will not be a man at the end of that process,\" she told CBS News.",
      "On Monday, President Trump and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper both called for the release of Jimmy Lai.",
      "In the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said, \"I feel so badly. I spoke to President Xi about it, and I asked to consider his release. He's not well. He's an older man, and he's not well. So I did put that request out, we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Cooper emphasized that Jimmy Lai is a British citizen and told Parliament that she had summoned the Chinese Ambassador after hearing the verdict.",
      "\"But for the sake of Jimmy Lai, for his family, but also for the people of Hong Kong, for the joint Declaration we signed, and for the rule of law, we will not relent on this,\" she said. \"Joined by nations across the world, we call again for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai.\"",
      "Earlier in the year, Claire Lai met with members of Congress on Capitol Hill, culminating in a bipartisan letter asking for her father's release.",
      "As the holidays near, Claire Lai remembers the few times she saw her father a year since 2020, on their birthdays and Christmas. She said she hopes she can see her father again someday, without their conversations recorded and without armed prison guards standing by.",
      "\"One of the many things I've learned from my father is that you have to face adversity and difficulties with a certain degree of cheer and spirit,\" she told CBS News. \"My father has shown that not even his failing health can alleviate him of the burden of truth, and that's why he chose to take the stand for so many days.\"",

    "summary": "The deadly terror attack at Bondi Beach in Sydney comes amid a significant spike in antisemitic rhetoric and attacks in Australia.",
    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 people had gathered on Bondi Beach on a warm day to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah in Australia. In stark contrast to the joyful energy on the beach, a terror plot was underway, allegedly planned in advance by a father and son who opened fire with rifles into the crowd, with an improvised explosive device at the ready in their car.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the younger suspect had been investigated by the country's primary intelligence agency in 2019 \u2014 reportedly over links to a suspected ISIS cell in Sydney \u2014   but that he was deemed to represent no security threat.",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians,\" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Sunday's mass shooting \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it was \"designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "Yet the two assailants were allegedly able to fire shots toward the beach for more than five minutes, according to eyewitness accounts. Videos show the gunmen taking their time to aim, shoot and then duck from a bridge near the beach. One video shows a good Samaritan jumping on the back of one of the shooters and wrestling his gun away. Local media reported that the man who intervened, identified as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, suffered two gunshot wounds.",
      "\"The first initial reaction wasn't even by police, it was by civilians, which raised a lot of questions about the role of police,\" said Oded Ailam, who worked in Israeli intelligence for two decades and reviewed videos of the attack for CBS News.",
      "Asked about police response time at a news conference Monday local time, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said, \"I respect a person having an opinion, but I've been really clear: Our police responded promptly. Our police respond very promptly. We work closely with the Jewish community. We are very attuned with providing support to the Jewish community.\"",
      "Ailam told CBS News, \"Everything points to this being a preplanned attack that was planned for a significant amount of time. The big question now is if Iran and Hezbollah will be implicated.\"",
      "Australia earlier this year determined a series of previous arson attacks targeting a synagogue and a Kosher food provider had been directed by Iran, and moved to cut diplomatic ties over the incidents.",
      "\"As a matter of principle, Iran condemns the violent attack against civilians in Sydney, Australia,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Sunday on social media. \"Terror violence and mass killing shall be condemned, wherever they're committed, as unlawful and criminal.\"",
      "When asked by reporters about whether Sunday's shooting was an intelligence failure, New South Wales officials waved off the questions and said their priority is keeping the community safe.",
      "The alleged assailants were a father and son duo. U.S. officials told CBS News on Sunday that they were from Pakistan, but Australian authorities later said the son was Australian-born, and they have not confirmed which country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "They had six firearms \u2014 purchased legally \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device to target the Jewish gathering, according to authorities.",
      "While shocking, the attack is not entirely surprising to people who track antisemitic attacks.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Australia has been plagued by reports of antisemitic attacks and incidents in the two years following Oct. 7, 2023, according to new figures from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "In one particularly notable incident last year, masked assailants conducted an arson attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. Seven months later an arsonist set fire to the doors of another Melbourne synagogue, the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, forcing the congregation to flee.",
      "Another arson attack was carried out at the kosher food provider Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney, also last year.",
      "The attacks on both the Adass Israel synagogue and the food company were determined by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to be tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. In August, Prime Minister Albanese expelled Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Sadeghi, and three other Iranian diplomats, citing the intelligence assessment concluding that Iran had directed antisemitic arson attacks on Australian soil.",
      "The ECAJ found antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number before Oct. 7, 2023, which is the largest spike of any J7 country between 2021 and 2024. J7 refers to the seven countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel that form the J7 Task Force Against Antisemitism: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Argentina and Australia.",
      "The J7 Task Force met in Sydney less than one week before Sunday's attack to discuss the growing security threat to the Jewish community in Australia.",
      "\"This attack is not only the latest in a disturbing series of antisemitic incidents in Australia but also around the globe, including in the United States,\" said Oren Segal, senior vice president of counter-extremism and intelligence at the Anti-Defamation League. \"And these incidents are becoming increasingly violent.\"",
      "This article has been updated to note that Australian authorities said the younger suspect is Australian-born. Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

    "summary": "At least 15 people were killed at a Jewish gathering on Australia's Bondi Beach, according to Australian government officials and police. One of two gunmen was also dead.",
    "story": [
      "An attack targeting a Jewish gathering at a famous Australian beach on Sunday killed at least 15 people, including a 12-year-old, government officials and police said. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including two officers and three children.",
      "Police said on Monday that two gunmen \u2014 a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son \u2014 had opened fire at Bondi Beach while the local Jewish community was celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. The 50-year-old gunman died, while his son was remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police. Police previously said the deceased gunman was the son, but Lanyon later clarified that the father was shot and killed by police.",
      "Officials had told CBS News on Sunday that Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "Albanese confirmed on Monday that Akram had been investigated for about six months during 2019 by the country's primary intelligence agency. National public broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the probe was over suspected links to an alleged ISIS cell in Sydney. Albanese said the investigation had determined that Akram posed no apparent threat to public safety.",
      "New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park said a 12-year-old child was among those killed in the attack. Three other children are being treated in the hospital, he said.",
      "\"This is absolutely horrendous for the community broadly, but particularly the Jewish community. ... What we saw last night was the worst of humanity, but at the same time, the very best of humanity,\" Park said.",
      "Officials have not identified the victims of the attack, although the international organization Chabad, which represents a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said that one of its rabbis, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah celebration where the shooting took place.",
      "Called Hanukkah by the Sea, the event was held to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday observed from sundown on Sunday until Monday, Dec. 22. More than 1,000 were at the beach when gunfire broke out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon. He called the attack a \"terrorist incident\" and said the perpetrators used \"long arms,\" referring to long guns such as shotguns or rifles, to carry it out.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Albanese also characterized the attack as targeted, with Minns saying it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\" The prime minister said it was \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\"",
      "\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations, and it is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,\" Albanese said during a news conference on Monday morning local time.",
      "Lanyon said police believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside a vehicle at Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, which they discovered shortly after the shooting occurred. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "International leaders have publicly condemned the attack.",
      "\"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Australia targeting a Jewish celebration,\" wrote U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in\u00a0a social media post. \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio's statement echoed others from officials in Israel, New Zealand, India, the United Kingdom and a number of European countries who similarly spoke out to denounce antisemitism and share their condolences after the shooting.",
      "King Charles also addressed the shooting in a statement, in which the monarch said he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack on Jewish people\" attending the Bondi Beach Hanukkah event.",
      "\"In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve,\" he said in the statement, adding that Australia's \"spirit of community and love ... will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.\"",
      "Gunman disarmed by bystander, video shows",
      "Images and video footage have emerged from the scene of the attack, showing the injured being wheeled away on stretchers by first responders.",
      "\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" said Albanese in a statement. \"My thoughts are with every person affected.\"",
      "One video appeared to show someone wrestling with one of the suspected gunmen and taking his weapon from him, according to Minns, who paid tribute to that individual in some of his comments Sunday.",
      "The video was recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. In it, a man jumped up from a crouched position behind a parked car and tackled the suspect, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "Following a short struggle, the man disarmed the suspect, pushed him to the ground and turned the weapon on him, at which point the suspect stood up and walked in the opposite direction. The man then lowered the weapon and raised his free hand in the air. Off to the side, one person appeared to be lying unresponsive on the sidewalk beside a different vehicle.",
      "In additional footage, which was also filmed by bystanders, crowds could be seen fleeing Bondi Beach as shots rang out in the background.",
      "Minns called the man, named by relatives to Australian media as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "Rare shooting",
      "Mass shootings in Australia are rare. But researchers have recorded dramatic upticks in antisemitic incidents in the country since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault by Hamas terrorists on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, along with spikes in hate incidents against Muslim groups.",
      "In response, the Australian government appointed special envoys last year to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in its communities. However, attacks have continued to happen since then. In July, an arsonist set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, another major Australian city, seven months after a different synagogue in the same city was burned by criminals in a blaze that injured one worshipper.",
      "This article has been updated to note that Australian authorities said the younger suspect is Australian-born. Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

      "ALWAYS RUNNING LATE? A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION COULD BE TO BLAME, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"For some people, it's personality-driven. They're distractible, optimistic about how long things take, or simply not tuned into the impact on others,\" the New York-based expert said.",
      "For others, the issue stems from neurobiological differences that affect how the brain manages time.",
      "Chronic lateness may not stem from poor planning, but from psychological and neurobiological factors. (iStock)",

      "For others, the struggle happens in the in-between moments. Shifting from one activity to another can feel surprisingly uncomfortable, so they linger longer than intended and lose time without noticing.",
      "Anxiety is a major factor behind why some people have trouble being on time, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Others may get caught up in the details, as perfectionism keeps them adjusting or \"fixing one more thing\" as the minutes slip away, Alpert said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",

      "\u2018Time audit\u2019",

      "There were almost three-quarters of a million more registered Democrats in North Carolina than Republicans 10 years ago. As of today, that difference is just over 1,000, according to the latest count by the North Carolina State Board of Elections.",

Meanwhile, the analysis found that Republicans gained about 2.4 million. In total, this amounted to a deficit for the Democratic Party of 4.5 million registered voters just over the last four years.",
      "In North Carolina, specifically, between 2005 and 2015, the difference in the number of registered Republicans and Democrats in North Carolina remained mostly steady, with a difference of about 670,000 give or take in 2005 and 2015, respectively. But, beginning in 2015, that deficit started to shrink.",

However, the increase in unaffiliated voters has impacted both Republicans and Democrats' overall vote share, with Democrats witnessing a much sharper drop in overall registered voters across the last decade, compared to Republicans, the data shows.",

      "Recreational exoskeletons have been popping up for years, but the new IRMO M1 exoskeleton feels like a turning point. This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions. Early backers on its global crowdfunding campaign are already pushing the project toward major funding goals.",

      "The M1 straps onto your waist and legs with modular fast-release bands. Each leg module weighs between 2.2 and 2.6 pounds. A 1,000 W motor provides up to 45% assist on each stride. IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",
      "Inside the frame sits a nine-axis IMU paired with an AI engine that studies your gait in real time. This lets the M1 fine-tune each push as it learns how you move. That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "How to buy the IRMO M1",
      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",

      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",

      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",

    "summary": "Baseball teams can now analyze complete swing mechanics in normal training environments using Theia&apos;s markerless AI system that processes standard high-speed footage.",
    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "Coaches can now review 3D bat paths and body sequencing using standard high-speed video. (Photo by Thien-An Truong/Getty Images)",
      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking.

      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",

      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "MIT\u2019s light-based scanner reads blood sugar through the skin without a single prick. (iStock)",
      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor. The accuracy seen in early testing shows that noninvasive tools are not a distant dream. They could help you catch swings in your levels faster and bring more comfort to a daily task that often feels overwhelming.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "A convincing layout doesn't mean it is legitimate. Always look at the domain name first. If it doesn't match the official site or uses odd spelling or extra characters, close it. Attackers rely on the fact that people recognize a page's design but ignore the address bar.",
      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

      "Above the tanks are four hydroponic tiers. Salt-tolerant greens grow over the seawater tank. Tomatoes and semi-salt-tolerant veggies thrive in the brackish zone. Herbs and lettuce sit above freshwater species like sturgeon. Edible flowers fill the top layer where sunlight hits strongest.

      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",

      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",

      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "PARENTS BLAME CHATGPT FOR SON\u2019S SUICIDE, LAWSUIT ALLEGES OPENAI WEAKENED SAFEGUARDS TWICE BEFORE TEEN\u2019S DEATH",
      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Attackers know users panic when they hear about API limits, billing failures or account verification issues. If you get an email claiming to be from an AI provider, do not click the link. Open the site manually or use the official app to confirm whether the alert is real.",
      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain. With ChatGPT now approaching a billion weekly users, that chain needs tighter rules, better oversight and fewer blind spots. If anything, this should be a reminder that the rush toward AI adoption needs stronger policy guardrails. Companies cannot hide behind transparent emails after the fact. They need to prove that the tools you rely on every day are secure at every layer, including the ones you never see.",

      "Malicious extensions spread through trusted browsers and quietly collected user data for years. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",

      "A senior White House official said the Western Hemisphere chapter is designed to \"reassert American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere\" by strengthening regional security partnerships, curbing drug flows and preventing pressures that fuel mass migration.

      "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discusses the threat of Islamic terrorism, the fallout from the Hanukkah terror attack in Australia, and more on \u2018Fox & Friends.\u2019",
      "FIRST ON FOX: Senior Israeli intelligence officials say warnings delivered to Australia ahead of a deadly attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach were part of a much broader alert: an accelerating global rise in attempts to execute terror attacks across Western countries, increasingly aimed not only at Jewish targets, but also at Christians and large gatherings especially during religious holidays.",
      "According to a senior Israeli intelligence official, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence service has been tracking a sharp increase in attempted attacks worldwide, many of them low-tech, quickly mobilized and designed to exploit open societies and crowded public events.",

      "Israeli intelligence officials say Australia is not an outlier. From their perspective, recent months have revealed a pattern of attempted and disrupted plots across Europe, North America and beyond, pointing to a sustained global threat rather than sporadic violence.",
      "\"If you knew how many terror attacks we exposed and prevented,\" the senior official said, \"your jaw would drop.\"",
      "Israeli intelligence officials say the rise in attempted attacks is driven in part by how extremist and state-linked networks build terror infrastructure globally while deliberately masking their origins.",
      "Officials say the networks frequently rely on non-Iranian nationals to carry out different roles along the operational chain, including logistics, intelligence gathering, financing and execution, in order to blur any connection to Tehran. In some cases, operatives are recruited from migrant or refugee backgrounds, while in others criminal elements or hired proxies are used to carry out acts of violence.",
      "People gather around a tribute for shooting victims outside the Bondi Pavilion at Sydney's Bondi Beach, Monday, Dec. 15, 2025, a day after the shooting. (Mark Baker/AP Photo)",
      "To avoid detection, officials say the networks rely on encrypted communications and clandestine in-person meetings, sometimes conducted outside the country where an attack is planned. In other cases, instructions are delivered remotely through secure channels that bypass standard telecommunications monitoring.",
      "According to Israeli assessments, extremist networks are increasingly overlapping: jihadist ideology, lone-actor violence and state-linked activity now exist in the same ecosystem, fueled by online radicalization and geopolitical instability. Many plots, officials say, are unsophisticated, making them harder to detect early while still capable of causing mass casualties.",

      "A senior foreign diplomatic source said the current environment is being shaped by what they described as a global contagion effect, in which attacks are amplified online, celebrated across extremist networks and rapidly imitated elsewhere.",

      "The source cautioned that Christian communities and broader civilian gatherings are also vulnerable, particularly during religious holidays and symbolic events that attract large crowds.",
      "This concern has been reflected across Europe in recent weeks, when authorities sharply increased security at Christmas markets and holiday celebrations amid warnings that seasonal events present prime targets for extremist violence.

Prosecutors said the plot was disrupted before explosives were fully assembled, underscoring both the scale of the threat and the importance of early intelligence intervention.",
      "A second senior Israeli intelligence source said the broader threat environment has deteriorated after two years of war in the Middle East, which they said has energized radical Islamist movements globally.",
      "According to the source, instability in Syria is of particular concern, creating conditions that could allow ISIS to regroup and once again project influence beyond the region.",

      "The spike in violence has unsettled a population accustomed to relative stability and has turned public security into Chile\u2019s top political issue.",
      "Although he has long held staunchly conservative positions on abortion, gender policy and same-sex marriage, Kast downplayed those issues during the campaign as he sought to broaden his appeal. Instead, he emphasized structural changes he says are necessary to confront the security crisis, including shrinking parts of the bureaucracy, tightening Chile\u2019s asylum system and giving the presidency greater authority to respond to organized crime.",
      "BOLIVIA PIVOTS TO US AS IT BREAKS FROM CHINA, MADURO AND YEARS OF LEFTIST RULE",
      "Kast also intends to steer Chile toward a more market-oriented economic model, with tax cuts, deregulation and expanded mining development \u2014 particularly in lithium and copper, two of the country\u2019s most important exports. He has signaled interest in strengthening ties with the United States and other Western partners, even as China remains Chile\u2019s largest trading partner and a major buyer of its mineral output.",

      "Chile\u2019s rightward turn follows a similar shift in neighboring Argentina, which elected libertarian firebrand Javier Milei on a platform of radical economic reform and political disruption.",
      "But the two leaders represent distinct strains of the right: Milei is an anti-establishment libertarian who thrives on theatrical confrontation and sweeping proposals to remake Argentina\u2019s economy, while Kast is a more traditional conservative focused on order, border enforcement and institutional authority. Their wins stem from similar voter frustrations, but they offer sharply different governing styles.",

      "Kast is also one of South America\u2019s most outspoken critics of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, frequently citing Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse and mass migration as warnings for Chile. He has accused Maduro of allowing criminal networks to flourish and has linked Venezuela\u2019s crisis directly to Chile\u2019s migration and security challenges.",
      "His party\u2019s lack of a congressional majority could slow or dilute parts of his agenda, but Kast\u2019s decisive margin suggests Chilean voters are prepared to test his hard-edged security strategy after years of political gridlock and rising public anxiety."

      "In the aftermath of a deadly terror attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach, Dionne Taylor, a senior figure in the community, says the most painful reality is that the violence did not come without warning.",
      "\"We have been completely let down by our government,\" Taylor, the communications manager of the Australia/Israel Jewish Affairs Council, told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview. \"We warned them that this snowball effect was going to happen, and it was only a matter of time before someone got killed.\"",
      "The shooting took place Sunday evening during a public Hanukkah event at Bondi Beach, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens, according to Reuters and The Associated Press. Australian authorities have described the attack as an act of terrorism targeting the Jewish community.",
      "Police said the suspected attackers were a father and his adult son. The father was killed at the scene, while the son was shot by police and taken to a hospital in critical condition.",

      "Taylor, who lives a 10-minute walk from Bondi Beach, said the attack was not an isolated act of violence, but the culmination of years of escalating antisemitism that authorities failed to confront.",
      "\"It started with hate speech,\" she said. \"Then graffiti. Then public demonstrations. Then firebombing synagogues, preschools, people\u2019s homes, people\u2019s cars. And now murder.\"",
      "She said Jewish leaders and community representatives repeatedly raised alarms with state and federal officials, warning that inaction would lead to bloodshed. Taylor pointed to formal submissions and a detailed report produced by Australia\u2019s special envoy to combat antisemitism, which she said was acknowledged by the government but never implemented.",

      "Taylor said the failure to act has had broader consequences for Australian society as a whole.",
      "\"There\u2019s been a number of situations that have led to the complete erosion of social cohesion here in Australia, a relaxed immigration policy, letting in too many refugees from the wrong places, a rise of radical Islamism and a basically slick government that really hasn\u2019t assisted or supported the Jewish community and other communities,\" Taylor said. \"So this attack, while it was a targeted attack on the Jewish community, is actually a targeted attack across the whole of Australia.\"",

      "All four represent competitive districts that could make or break the GOP\u2019s narrow House majority in November.

      "Fitzpatrick said his hand was forced by the refusal of Republican leadership to \u201ccompromise\u201d after he attempted \u201cfor months\u201d to offer ideas and amendments.",
      "\u201cHouse leadership then decided to reject every single one of these amendments,\u201d Fitzpatrick said in a statement. \u201cAs I\u2019ve stated many times before, the only policy that is worse than a clean three-year extension without any reforms, is a policy of complete expiration without any bridge. Unfortunately, it is House leadership themselves that have forced this outcome.\u201d",
      "The issue has caught Republican leaders in a rare predicament: The vast majority of GOP lawmakers want the enhanced ACA tax credits to expire on schedule, but a small group favors an extension to prevent sharp premium hikes.",
      "The revolt among the centrist lawmakers comes on the same day House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is calling a vote on a GOP bill to implement a series of policies popular on the right, called the \"Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act.\u201d It would codify Association Health Plans, authorize cost-sharing reduction payments and seek transparency for pharmacy benefit managers.",
      "Johnson had negotiated with the Republicans who favor an ACA extension on an amendment, but that was jettisoned after talks collapsed over the weekend, he told reporters Tuesday, while projecting that his bill would still pass the House.",
      "The ACA funding bill is not expected to come to the floor before the Dec. 31 deadline, meaning the subsidies will lapse for an estimated 22 million people who get their health care insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Under House rules, seven legislative days need to lapse before a bill, discharged by such a petition, comes to the floor. The House, however, is only scheduled to be in session until Friday, before lawmakers head home for a two-week holiday recess.",
      "The House is set to return to Washington on Jan. 6, meaning the vote on the three-year extension will likely be held in the second week of that month \u2014 unless Johnson attempts to expedite it to the floor.",
      "And if it does pass the House, it still faces hurdles in the Senate, where Republicans rejected the three-year funding extension on the floor just last week. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has slammed the Covid-era ACA subsidies and said he favors a broader overhaul, not just an extension of those funds.",
      "\u201cOur views on health care and the Democrat views on health care are very different, and I think that\u2019s a difficult challenge that we have to figure out how to overcome,\u201d Thune told reporters Tuesday. \u201cBut if they\u2019re willing to accept changes that actually would put more power and control and resources in the hands of the American people and less of that in the pockets of the insurance companies, I think there\u2019s a path forward.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's successful discharge petition marks yet another example of Speaker Johnson \u2014 presiding over a razor-thin 220-213 majority \u2014 losing control over what happens on the House floor.",
      "Just last month, a handful of GOP rebels bucked Johnson and teamed up with Democrats on a discharge petition, forcing a vote to release all of the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein. The final tally was 427-1 and the Senate, by unanimous consent, quickly forwarded the bill to President Donald Trump, who signed it into law."

      "On CNBC, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said, \"We feel those facts really support the approval of the deal.\"",

Without naming the bidder, it says another firm offered to buy its cable networks for $25 billion in cash and a 20% stake in Warner Bros. Discovery's Streaming & Studios unit, which Netflix ultimately agreed to buy outright."

      "A pair of senators raised the alarm about toys powered by artificial intelligence in a new series of letters issued late Tuesday, demanding information from six toy manufacturers.",
      "Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sent letters to the CEOs of Little Learners Toys, Mattel, Miko, Curio, FoloToy and Keyi Robot requesting information about the manufacturers\u2019 data-sharing policies, testing for toys\u2019 potential psychological and developmental harms, and safety guardrails to prevent explicit and inappropriate content from being shared with children.",
      "\u201cWhile AI has incredible potential to benefit children with learning and accessibility, experts have raised concerns about AI toys and the lack of research that has been conducted to understand the full effect of these products on our kids,\u201d the senators wrote.",
      "\u201cToymakers have a unique and profound influence on childhood \u2014 and with that influence comes responsibility. Your company must not choose profit over safety for children,\u201d the letter says.",
      "NBC News reported last week, in collaboration with the U.S. Public Interest Group Education Fund, that several AI-enabled toys from different brands engage in sexual and inappropriate conversations with users. Some, like the Miiloo plush toy from Chinese manufacturer Miriat, shared step-by-step instructions about how to light matches and sharpen knives in tests with researchers.",
      "The AI-powered devices have also raised concerns about toys\u2019 data-collection and sharing practices, in addition to the potential for children to become attached or addicted to their AI companions. Some of the toys are marketed to children as young as 3 years old.",
      "The letters ask the companies for detailed information about the safeguards they use to prevent their toys \u201cfrom generating sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise inappropriate content for children,\u201d in addition to information about independent, third-party testing performed to ensure the toys do not engage in harmful conversation.",
      "The letter also asks for information about the data collected from children and relevant privacy policies for governing it. Miko, for example, says it may store a \u201cUser\u2019s face, voice and emotional states\u201d for up to three years.",
      "Given concerns about the potential use of toy-gathered data by outside parties or even for state-sponsored espionage, the letter asks for information about third-party data sharing with cloud services and AI model providers.",
      "The letter adds to growing skepticism on Capitol Hill about AI-enabled toys. In mid-November, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, warned Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a letter about AI-enabled toys being manufactured in China.",
      "\u201cGiven the security risks and privacy concerns associated with these products, I urge you to initiate a campaign aimed at raising public awareness to American educators across the country on the potential misuse of the data collected with these devices,\u201d Krishnamoorthi wrote.",
      "The AI-enabled toy market is projected to grow to $25 billion by 2035, according to a recent estimate, while over 1,500 AI toy companies operate in China."

      "Reiner also had an ability to showcase undiscovered, young talent. Robin Wright made her film debut in 1987's \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d which also starred Fred Savage before viewers were introduced to him in 1988 in \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d \u201cStand by Me,\u201d released in 1986, featured Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack before they were household names.

      "\u201cIt is truly heartbreaking. Rob was one of the most loving, compassionate, and kind people I have ever known. He was an extraordinary director and the impact he had on me has stayed with me throughout my career. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe found me in a casting room in downtown Chicago and gave me the opportunity to be a part of something that has become so much bigger than anyone could have ever imagined,\u201d he captioned a Dec. 15 Instagram photo of him as a child with Reiner.",

We must raise our voices for them. I\u2019ll continue to try and follow Rob\u2019s example as an artist and a humanitarian. I hope you do too.",

      "\u201cWe watched him on All in the Family when we were little, and as we came of age, he made movies about our lives as we were living them: movies about growing up, falling in and out of love, about seeing the goodness that exists inside every single person, if only they are open to it. He told us stories about the strength of the human spirit, and he made us laugh. Oh, how he made us laugh.\u201d",
      "Wheaton said he didn\u2019t interact often with Reiner, but his impact was profound.",
      "\u201cI only really knew Rob Reiner for one summer, in 1985, when we made Stand By Me. We only saw each other a handful of times in the last 40 years, and outside of those rare meetings, we only spoke a couple of times. Even though I haven\u2019t spoken to him in years, I will miss him forever.\u201d Eagle-eyed fans will note the \u201cI will miss him forever\u201d line is what the adult version of Wheaton\u2019s character wrote in his story as \u201cStand by Me\u201d drew to a close.",

Just being stressed out as a teacher, but still enjoying it, and I was able to talk to them. Then it ended up creating a little support group in a way. Also, we\u2019re able to trade lesson plans and info. It\u2019s been a huge help to talk with teachers from around the world and connect with them.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known (as) the teacher that asked out Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. I\u2019d rather be known as a great teacher and a great coach, which I think I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my passion.\u201d",
      "Myers, who has nearly 90,000 followers on Instagram now, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting opportunity for me to actually shine a light on education and show people what I teach. There\u2019s a lot of other teachers out there that don\u2019t post and you don\u2019t actually see what they do.

      "Ryan and Crystal have yet to speak publicly on Reiner\u2019s death.",
      "Ryan reflected on the movie while paying homage to her co-star, Crystal, an honoree at the 46th Kennedy Center Honors in December 2023. She referenced the scene where her character fakes an orgasm while sitting across from Crystal\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cThis scene came really naturally to me, and I really have Billy to thank for that,\u201d she said of the moment. \u201cI\u2019ve actually never been around anyone who made faking an orgasm easier. So, thank you, Billy.\u201d",
      "Ryan later attributed the success of the film to a few factors, including Reiner\u2019s \u201cbrilliant direction,\u201d a \u201cperfect script\u201d from the late Nora Ephron and \u201cchemistry.\u201d",
      "\u201cChemistry is ... well, no one really knows what chemistry is, but Harry and Sally had it,\u201d she explained.",

    "story": [
      "Wassail might be \u201call over the town\u201d this month, but what is it, exactly?",
      "Every holiday season, carolers sing about drinking eggnog by the fire like Medieval people did, or indulging in a holiday punch or Christmas goose like any of a number of Victorian families, all of which many modern folk still enjoy.",
      "However, some songs blaring over shopping mall speakers or the sound systems of holiday-themed bars make us wonder: What the heck is wassail? Why don\u2019t we still eat sugar plums and roasted chestnuts?",
      "And, perhaps most importantly, what is figgy pudding and why does Bing Crosby want it so badly?",
      "Figgy Pudding (\u2018We Wish You a Merry Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cNow, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it right here\u201d",
      "Merry modern revelers sing this song without knowing that \u201cfiggy pudding\u201d historically did not contain figs, as it was a misinterpretation of a British holiday classic \u2014 plum pudding \u2014 which is not a pudding in the American sense, but a dense, boiled dessert.",
      "The dish that became figgy pudding was originally more on the savory side, with preserved, sweetened meat and boiled vegetables, but eventually included prunes. Also, the word \u201cplum\u201d eventually became a label for all dried fruits, confusing the issue further.",
      "While stateside bakers don\u2019t traditionally prepare this complex treat for the holidays, save for brave souls like YouTubers Tyler Williams and Safiya Nygaard in 2022, it is still regularly sold in British stores.",
      "A version of figgy pudding being sold at luxury department store Harrods features sultanas, raisins, demerara sugar, pitted plums, figs \u2014 unlike its historical predecessor \u2014 and a butterscotch sauce, for $24.",
      "Sugar Plums (\u2018\u2019Twas the Night Before Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads\u201d",
      "Interestingly, the history of figgy pudding and sugar plums are related since they both use the word \u201cplum\u201d to refer to fruit or dessert.",
      "A sugar plum is a sugar-coated candy popular in Victorian times which often had a dried fruit like a cherry or fig or nut in the center. Not a plum at all, its name referred to its size and shape.",
      "In 2024, YouTuber Max Miller of Tasting History made sugar plums the traditional way and discovered how time-consuming it is to roll a nut in layer after layer of warm sugar until it becomes candy-coated.",
      "This might be why sugar plums live in the lyrics of this Christmas ditty and not actually in our modern tradition.",
      "Cup of Cheer (\u2018A Holly Jolly Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cHave a cup of cheer\u201d",
      "While a cup that makes you cheerful these days may be a strong cocktail made by Sam Heughan, the term doesn\u2019t only mean adult beverages in vintage Christmas lyricism. A \u201ccup of cheer\u201d can also refer to hot cocoa.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Wassail (\u2018Gloucestershire Wassail,\u2019 \u2018Here We Come A-Wassailing\u2019 and More)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWassail! Wassail all over the town!\u201d",
      "The term wassail has an olde English history: The hot mulled punch, which often consists of cider, wine or ale with winter spices, comes from the words \u201cwaes hael\u201d which means \u201cbe healthy.\u201d",
      "The term is also also a verb: Back in olden times, groups of revelers went door-to-door wassailing with a wassailing bowl, offering sips of drink from it for gifts at each home they visited. This tradition may seem familiar because it\u2019s actually where Christmas caroling comes from.",
      "Roasted Chestnuts (\u2018The Christmas Song\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cChestnuts roasting on an open fire\u201d",
      "The opener to Nat King Cole\u2019s classic rendition of \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d features a once-abundant treat enjoyed by early Americans during the holidays. In the 18th and 19th centuries, chestnuts were one of the most popular ingredients in early American food because of the preponderance of Chestnut trees speckling the East Coast at the time.",
      "For this Christmas tradition, a roasted chestnut has a soft texture and some say it tastes mild and sweet with a fluffy or potato-like texture \u2014 though one social media user who isn\u2019t a fan claims they have a \u201cmealy\u201d texture.",
      "Sadly, in 1904, a fungal disease tore through chestnut tree populations in the U.S., causing them to almost go extinct and fall out of favor as a traditional treat as a result, although countries like Turkey and Italy still feature the glossy brown nut during the holidays."

      "\u201cAnd I think in many ways the Rob Reiner Meathead character was the way in for the audience. He was the new member of family, if you will. And I think Rob Reiner even understood what an important role, iconic role that was,\" Karger added. \"At one point, he said, \u2018If I ever won the Nobel Prize, the headline would say, \u201cMeathead Wins Nobel.\u201d\u2019 That was really a role and a character that is going to last for decades to come.\u201d",

      "New city, new hairstyle. Season 5 of \"Emily in Paris\" has many changes in store for its chipper American protagonist, played by Lily Collins.",
      "TODAY lifestyle contributor Jill Martin ventured to Venice to chat about Season 5 with Collins and her onscreen and real life friend, Ashley Park, who plays Mindy.",
      "Among the topics of their talk? What inspired the sudden strand switch-up for Collins' character.",
      "\"So did Emily get the bob, or did Lily get the bob?\" Martin asked in a segment that will air on TODAY on Dec. 15.",
      "\"Lily got the bob,\" Collins clarified. \"Usually Lily gets the haircuts first, and then Marylin (Fitoussi, the show's costume designer) is inspired by the haircuts to create the new wardrobe for the next season. And then I always go to Darren (Star, the show's creator) and I'm like, 'Hey, can I keep it?'\"",
      "Throughout the series, which returns for Season 5 on Dec. 18, Emily has rarely strayed from her signature long, brunette locks. Except, of course, that time she decided to cut her own bangs in the Season 3 premiere.",
      "As it turns out, this was another case of art imitating life for Collins.",
      "\"In the season with the bangs, we created part of the storyline, you know, Ashley coming in, and being like, 'No!'\" the actor said.",
      "\"Trauma bangs,\" Park noted.",
      "Collins' real-life bob was a bit more of a dramatic mane move than getting bangs. She told Jill it's a style she wouldn't have considered sporting earlier in her life. But her hairstylist, Gregory Russell, convinced her to try it, since he'd always wanted to see her with shorter hair.",
      "\u201cI really love changing my hair, which is ironic, because growing up, I was like, \u2018I never want to cut or color my hair.\u2019 And so I did it, and I didn\u2019t know how people would react. I was like, \u2018Is there going to have to be a wig next season or whatever?'\" she recalled.",
      "Luckily, Star was down to keep the hairstyle, and the duo proceeded to debate if they should write it into the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, we already did that with the bangs.\u2019 So there was one moment, I believe it was cut (from the show) but there was a moment in the very first episode when I go into the Rome office and I sit down. Philippine (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who plays Sylvie) comes in, and the first thing she says is, \u2018You cut your hair.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s not a compliment. We\u2019ve gotta go,\u2019\u201d she remembered.",
      "Park wanted to make sure the merits of Collins' haircut were acknowledged so she improvised a bit while filming.",
      "\u201cI added a line. Because when Mindy comes to Rome, I remember being like, \u2018Wait, hold up. I know that Lily got this haircut, but I feel like Mindy would at least be, like, \u2018Love your hair!\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Martin was also curious to know if becoming a mother inspired Collins' new shorter hairstyle. In January 2025, Collins announced that she had welcomed her first child with her husband Charlie McDowell.",
      "\"No, it didn\u2019t. I always wanted to do it. I had a very short haircut when I was 25 and then it grew out. But then I just kept it growing. No, it is more practical, perhaps,\" she said.",
      "Regardless of her motivation for chopping her hair, the end result is fabulous, if you ask Park.",

      "The charges came as the first funerals for the victims were held under tight security, not far from the scene of the antisemitic massacre.

      "\u201cThere were 5- to 6-foot waves, maybe even bigger waves than that, and we were doing this in the middle of the night,\u201d Bryan Stern, who heads the Tampa, Florida-based Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, told NBC News. \u201cIt was pitch black, almost no moonlight. All of us were very cold and wet.\u201d",

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

      "As a result of this warming, \u201cmelting permafrost is altering ecosystems, turning over 200 watersheds in Arctic Alaska orange as iron and other elements are released into its rivers,\u201d Thur said. Researchers have observed higher acidity and a greater concentration of toxic metals in these rusting streams."

      "President Donald Trump says that Russia and Ukraine are closer to peace than they have ever been.",
      "Days of intense negotiations ended with the United States, Ukraine and Europe hailing significant progress as Trump pushes for a deal to end the Kremlin's war by Christmas.",
      "Washington and Kyiv appear to have made notable shifts to secure progress but huge questions remain, not least whether Moscow will once again flatly reject the idea of making any significant concessions.",
      "And while the U.S. has now offered Ukraine the robust security guarantees it has long sought, the fate of key territory on the conflict\u2019s eastern front lines remains pivotal, yet unresolved.",
      "After meetings with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and European leaders in Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that Kyiv had now been offered an equivalent of NATO\u2019s Article 5 deterrence mechanism, under which an attack on one member is considered an attack on them all.",
      "This guarantee would be legally binding, he said, voted on and approved by the U.S. Congress.",
      "Zelenskyy said the latest draft was not \"perfect\" but was \"very workable.\" He abandoned Ukraine's long-held ambition of joining NATO over the weekend, ahead of the talks.",
      "These guarantees are \"the biggest win so far for Ukraine and for Europe,\" a U.S. official told reporters, warning that they \u201cwill not be on the table forever.\u201d The official added that they believe Russia will accept it in a final deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has maintained that any deal would need to provide concrete security guarantees to prevent future attacks by Russia. It\u2019s a historically sensitive issue for Kyiv since Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 in violation of the Budapest Memorandum, meant to guarantee Ukraine's post-Soviet sovereignty in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons.",
      "European leaders suggested their countries could lead a \u201cmultinational force\u201d supported by the U.S. that would \u201cassist in the regeneration of Ukraine\u2019s forces, in securing Ukraine\u2019s skies, and in supporting safer seas,\u201d alongside a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring, verification and deconfliction mechanism.",
      "All of this was discussed on a call with Trump, Zelenskyy said, and the American leader appeared happy with the progress.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re closer now than we have been ever,\u201d Trump said Monday.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment on the status of the talks.",
      "But the Kremlin is unlikely to share in the enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s highly unlikely that Putin will buy into this,\u201d said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe draft agreement includes clauses that stand in diametric opposition to policy statements made repeatedly by Russia on what it regards as an acceptable basis for resolving the conflict.\u201d",
      "The multinational force is \u201ca clear red line for Putin,\u201d said John Lough, head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a London/Washington-based think tank focused on Russia. The Kremlin will also reject the idea of a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, he said, and will likely ask for restrictions on the kinds of weapons systems available to Kyiv\u2019s forces.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told ABC News on Monday that while he thinks Russia and the U.S. might be \u201con the verge\u201d of a deal, the agreement can\u2019t include the presence of foreign troops in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cSo this is likely to go a few more rounds,\u201d Lough said.",
      "And still to be worked out is the future of eastern Ukraine.",
      "Putin insists Russia is winning on the battlefield, giving him no incentive to negotiate what he thinks he can achieve by force.",
      "He wants Ukraine to give up its entire Donbas region, even though Kyiv's forces still control a part of it and it is something Zelenskyy has said he will never do.",
      "\u201cThe Americans are trying to find a compromise,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday. \u201cThey are proposing a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "Trump has insisted that Ukraine would have to cede territory, but it's unclear how this compromise would work or whether the Kremlin would give it the time of day.",
      "A U.S. official said they had given Zelenskyy some \"thought-provoking ideas,\" and that they would speak with Russia and Europe about them after his response. Zelenskyy said the U.S. would take the new draft to Russia in the coming days.",
      "Asked if any of the security guarantees floated Monday were unacceptable to the Kremlin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had yet to see any updated agreements. He reiterated that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a short-term ceasefire over Christmas as Kyiv has suggested.",
      "\u201cWe want peace. We don\u2019t want a truce to give Ukraine a breathing space and prepare for a continuation of the war,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "But while the Kremlin is likely to stonewall the newest agreements, Tuck said, the proposed security guarantees put pressure on Russia by implying a growing consensus between Ukraine and the West on what a peace agreement should look like.",
      "\u201cThe agreement isn\u2019t nothing, we aren\u2019t back to square one: the statement does indicate a more united front by the West, and getting the U.S. to commit, even in general and early terms, to providing some form of security guarantees is a significant development,\u201d Tuck said."

      "The Trump administration has defended the strikes, saying they're critical in preventing the flow of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid often made with chemicals from China and trafficked through Mexico, into the country. Fentanyl is the nation's leading cause of overdose deaths.",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\u201d Hegseth said on X last month. \u201cEvery trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\u201d",

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sound of gentle singing filled the air on Bondi Beach, the site of Australia's deadliest shooting in almost three decades.",
      "Alon Meltzer, 37, an associate rabbi at the nearby Mizrachi Synagogue, was among those who on Monday sang Hebrew prayers about fellowship, compassion and mercy near the place where two attackers targeted a Hanukkah celebration a day earlier. Officials have designated the incident \u201cantisemitic terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole world feels narrow, dark and turbulent, but have no fear,\u201d Meltzer said, describing one of the prayers.",
      "Meltzer and his wife, 41-year-old social worker Simonne Turner, who were at Bondi Beach with their three children, lost friends in the Sunday attack in Sydney, which killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more.",
      "A 10-year-old girl, a former police officer, a Holocaust survivor and two rabbis were among those killed in the attack, which officials said targeted Jewish people at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.",
      "Police identified the two suspects as a father and son, ages 50 and 24. Officers fatally shot the 50-year-old at the scene, while the 24-year-old \u201csuffered critical injuries\u201d and remains hospitalized.",
      "For Australians, the overwhelming feeling is shock. After a 1996 shooting in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur that killed 35 people, the country overhauled its gun laws precisely to prevent such an attack from ever happening again. According to police, who seized three firearms and two improvised explosive devices from the scene at Bondi Beach, the 50-year-old suspect was a licensed firearms holder who owned six firearms.",
      "There is also anger. Australia has struggled to address a surge in antisemitism fueled in part by Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, and local Jewish groups have criticized what they see as a lack of support from authorities."

      "For the past couple of years, leaders in Australia\u2019s Jewish community have been seeing a rise in antisemitism and urging the country\u2019s leaders to act.",
      "But Australia, like other countries grappling with a resurgence of what\u2019s been called the \u201coldest hatred\u201d since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, has been slow to react to the threat, Jewish leaders said Monday.",
      "The country saw its deadliest mass killing in nearly 30 years, with the massacre of 15 people this past weekend during a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen every manner of exclusion, abuse, attack, harassment, threats, fire bombings, burning of synagogues,\u201d said Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. \u201cThis country has changed fundamentally in two years, and it\u2019s culminated now on the beach.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath of the shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and his National Cabinet vowed Monday to eradicate the \u201cevil scourge\u201d of antisemitism and take other steps like further tightening the country\u2019s already stringent gun control measures and establishing a centralized National Hate Crimes and Incidents Database.",
      "Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said Albanese and the Australian government have, thus far, been \u201call talk and no action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the first incident of this kind in Australia, just the worst,\u201d he said. \u201cWarm words of embrace are just not going to cut it. We\u2019re looking for action, changes of policies.\u201d",
      "Rabbi Menachem Gluckowsky, the deputy chief justice of the Chabad Rabbinical Court in Israel, echoed Cooper.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call for Australia for sure,\u201d Gluckowsky said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a wake-up call for all countries. This is not just our battle. It\u2019s not just a battle for the Jewish people. This is a battle on evil. Just because you feel you\u2019re right, you can\u2019t gun down people cold bloodedly.\u201d",
      "Gluckowsky likened the Bondi Beach attack to the pogroms that European Jews endured for centuries. He said governments worldwide, and especially in the West, have been slow to respond to rising anti-Jewish hatred.",
      "Both Gluckowsky and Cooper contend that pro-Palestinian demonstrations have fanned the flames of antisemitism. And Australia\u2019s decision in September to formally recognize a Palestinian state was a \u201csignal\u201d to terrorists determined to attack Jews, Cooper said.",
      "\u201cThey have allowed Jews to twist in the wind,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday, Albanese was asked whether he saw any link between the recognition of a Palestinian state and the Bondi shooting.",
      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And overwhelmingly, most of the world recognizes a two-state solution as being the way forward in the Middle East,\u201d the prime minister said.",
      "\u201cMy job is to provide support for the Jewish community, is to make it clear that Australians overwhelmingly stand with the Jewish community at this difficult time,\u201d he added in response to a follow-up question.",
      "Cooper\u2019s denunciation came a day after a father-son terror team opened fire on a Hanukkah celebration taking place on the iconic beach. The 50-year-old father died at the scene. His 24-year-old son remained in a coma in a hospital on Monday, officials said.",
      "So far, Australian officials have not released their names or divulged a motive. But since the Israeli-Hamas war erupted two years ago, Australian lawmakers and experts have reported a surge in antisemitic incidents.",
      "The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people in Israel, and the Israeli military response led to the death of over 70,000 in the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d an Australian parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism concluded in October 2024.",

      "There were 2,062 such incidents the year before, an all-time high for Australia, the organization reported.",
      "Homes, cars and schools were vandalized with anti-Israel messages. A synagogue and childcare center were targeted by arsonists. Two nurses were suspended for posting online that they would kill or not treat Jewish patients.",
      "And police in January foiled what they said was an antisemitic plot when officers seized a travel trailer packed with explosives.",
      "Most of the threats were reported in Sydney and Melbourne, which are Australia\u2019s biggest cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population of around 117,000.",
      "Previously, Australian lawmakers responded to the threats by passing tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "Now they\u2019re looking into tightening Australia\u2019s gun laws to make it harder for residents to get their hands on the kind of high-powered rifles and shotguns that were reportedly used Sunday to stain the sands of Bondi Beach with blood.",
      "Antisemitism online has also spiked in recent years, fueled by anger around the conflict between Israel and Hamas and enabled by a new freewheeling social media landscape where content moderation on sites like X and others has been loosened.",
      "The Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches misinformation and extremism, found a 4,963% increase in the number of antisemitic YouTube comments on conflict-related videos, compared to the days before the Oct. 7 attack.",

      "Lai, one of the most prominent critics of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, was arrested in 2020 shortly after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in response to the anti-government protests, which roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019 and sometimes turned violent.",
      "He was found guilty of two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials under legislation from Hong Kong\u2019s time as a British colony.",
      "Lai, who turned 78 last week and faces life in prison, will be sentenced later and is allowed to appeal. On Monday, he appeared thin but in good spirits as he entered the courtroom wearing glasses, a pale green sweater and a gray jacket, smiling and waving to his family.",
      "Western governments and rights groups have criticized the 156-day trial, which began in December 2023, as politically motivated. Both the United States and Britain have called for Lai, a British citizen, to be released, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to \u201cfree\u201d him.",
      "In their 855-page verdict, the three handpicked judges focused on Lai's interactions with senior U.S. government officials, including meetings he had at the height of the 2019 protests with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and multiple members of Congress.",
      "Judge Esther Toh said Lai had persistently lobbied Washington to \u201chelp bring down\u201d the Chinese government by imposing sanctions, blockades or other hostile measures \u201cwith the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "She said it was \u201canalogous to the situation where an American national asked for help from Russia to bring down the U.S. government under the guise of helping the state of California.\u201d",

      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty and spent 52 days testifying, denied using his overseas connections to influence foreign policy on China and Hong Kong. He also said he never intended to \u201cpollute\u201d his readers\u2019 minds but was only commenting on facts.",
      "Toh said Lai had \u201cnever wavered in his intention to destabilize\u201d the Chinese government, citing his WhatsApp messages, live chats, Fox News interviews and social media posts.

      "\u201cJimmy Lai has long used his media outlet, Apple Daily, to wantonly create social conflicts, incite social antagonism, incite hatred, glorify violence and openly beg for foreign sanctions,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe law will never allow anyone, regardless of profession or background, to openly harm their own country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. A White House official confirmed to NBC News last month that Trump discussed Lai\u2019s case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea in October.",
      "Lai\u2019s son Sebastien Lai said after the verdict that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by his father\u2019s health condition and that \u201cthe U.K. government has to do more.\u201d",

      "\u201cJimmy Lai\u2019s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy,\u201d Beh Lih Yi, the group\u2019s Asia-Pacific director, said in a statement. \u201cThe risk of him dying from ill health in prison increases as each day passes \u2014 he must be reunited with his family immediately.\u201d",
      "The Hong Kong and Chinese governments say Lai has received a fair trial and that the criticism is an attempt to undermine the city\u2019s rule of law. They say press freedom continues to be protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing \u201cexpresses strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the public slanders and smears against Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary by certain countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is entirely reasonable, fair and lawful\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s judicial organs \u201cto perform their duties, uphold the authority of the law and safeguard national security,\u201d said the spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.",
      "Lai has spent nearly five years in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2020, during which time he has been convicted on multiple other charges, including unauthorized assembly and fraud. His family and supporters have expressed growing concern about his health, as Lai suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart palpitations.",
      "The Hong Kong government says Lai has received \u201cadequate and comprehensive\u201d medical services in custody and that it separates people such as Lai from other prisoners at their own request to ensure their \u201cpersonal safety and well-being.\u201d",
      "Though the Lai trial is Hong Kong\u2019s highest-profile case stemming from the crackdown, it has \u201cmuch less significant\u201d implications for the city\u2019s press freedom and autonomy than two other cases from last year, said John Burns, an emeritus professor specializing in Chinese politics at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "Those cases are the convictions of two journalists accused of sedition over their work for the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Stand News and the subversion charges against 47 pro-democracy figures over their involvement in an unofficial primary election, 45 of whom were convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Open dissent has been chilled in Hong Kong under the Beijing-imposed national security law and related local legislation, both of which officials say were necessary to restore stability after the 2019 protests. Most of the city\u2019s pro-democracy figures have been imprisoned, quit politics or moved overseas.",
      "The verdict in Lai\u2019s case comes a day after Hong Kong\u2019s last major opposition party, the Democratic Party, disbanded after a vote by its members, who cited pressure from Chinese officials or intermediaries.",
      "It also comes a week after near-record-low turnout in a \u201cpatriots only\u201d legislative election held under rules that were changed in 2021 to require national security vetting of candidates. Officials have defended the new rules as necessary to restore stability, but critics say they have sidelined groups such as the Democratic Party and left the legislature without any meaningful opposition.",
      "Tensions were already running high in Hong Kong amid public grief over a fire at a high-rise housing complex last month that killed at least 160 people in the city\u2019s worst blaze in almost 80 years. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have vowed to punish any \u201canti-China\u201d forces that try to use the tragedy to \u201crecreate the chaos\u201d of 2019."

    "summary": "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 As Chileans vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is likely to become the country\u2019s next leader",
    "story": [
      "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 As Chileans vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is likely to become the country\u2019s next leader.",
      "Kast\u2019s commanding lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "Many voters are frustrated with the options",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast\u2019s claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election and later endorsed Kast, substantial support for Franco Parisi \u2014 a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "Kast raises expectations, but reality is a different story",
      "Even if elected, it remains uncertain whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises. They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile\u2019s March 11 presidential inauguration, warning immigrants without legal status that they should get out before they \u201chave to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in Santiago, the capital, said he and like-minded Chileans are \u201calso counting down the days, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast.\u201d",
      "Boric\u2019s left-wing government is under fire",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua seized clandestine migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America\u2019s safest and wealthiest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has hovered around just 30% for the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe are living through a moment of psychosis, thanks to this government,\u201d said Nati P\u00e9rez, an 87-year-old Peruvian who immigrated to Chile over a decade ago, heading to vote for Kast at an old railroad terminal in central Santiago that was converted into a vast polling center for the day. \u201cHe\u2019s not against immigrants, he\u2019s against crime. Venezuela sent all their criminals here.\u201d",
      "Others say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile\u2019s market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile\u2019s northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country\u2019s first public security ministry.",
      "\u201cI actually thought this government would be worse. I have to admit that it has improved security,\u201d said Mariano Jara, 55, emerging from a polling station where he said he voted for Kast. \u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done. There\u2019s room to get tougher.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s homicide rate has fallen in the last two years, now on par with the rate in the United States. But that has done nothing to change the widespread feeling of insecurity.",
      "In Chile, just 39% of people feel safe walking alone at night, according to a recent Gallup survey of 144 countries. That\u2019s around the same figure as in Ecuador, which is now in the midst of a violent, drug-driven crime wave. In Libya, where fractious militias jostle for political power, over 70% of people said they feel safe.",
      "Crime and migration overshadow all other concerns",
      "As Boric\u2019s former minister of labor, Jara became popular as the architect of the administration\u2019s most important welfare measures.",
      "That matters little now. Voters\u2019 concerns have forced her to switch gears. She has vowed to toughen border security, register undocumented migrants, tackle money laundering and step up police raids.",
      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",
      "Learning from his previous two failed presidential runs, Kast has avoided topics that fire up his critics \u2014 such as his German-born father\u2019s Nazi past, nostalgia for Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "When asked about his deeply conservative values, Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine, says only that they remain the same. His supporters, including voters who previously spurned him over his stance on social issues, now say they\u2019re willing to trade abstract human rights concerns for increased safety on the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to hear that he\u2019s going to separate immigrant children from their parents, it\u2019s sad, that\u2019s going to be a problem for me,\u201d said Natacha Feliz, a 27-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, referring to a recent interview in which Kast said immigrant parents without legal status who didn\u2019t self-deport would be obliged to hand their kids over to the state.",
      "\u201cBut this is happening everywhere, not just in Chile. Let\u2019s just hope that our security situation improves.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump vowed retaliation Saturday after two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian U.S. interpreter were killed in an attack in Syria, an incident the Defense Department said occurred during a counterterrorism engagement.",
      "\"This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"There will be very serious retaliation.\"",
      "Three other U.S. personnel were wounded in the attack in Palmyra, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesperson, said on X. The soldiers \"were conducting a key leader engagement\" in \"support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations,\" he said.",
      "\"This attack is currently under active investigation,\" Parnell said.",
      "U.S. Central Command said that the attack was an ambush by \"a lone ISIS gunman\" and that the gunman was engaged and killed.",
      "A Pentagon official told NBC News the attack occurred in an area outside the control of Syria\u2019s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on X that U.S. partner forces killed the person who carried out the attack. He did not provide additional details about the perpetrator or the forces involved.",
      "\"The savage who perpetrated this attack was killed by partner forces,\" Hegseth wrote, adding that those who target Americans \"will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Syria\u2019s Interior Ministry, Nour al-Din al-Baba, said on state television that internal security officials had issued warnings to partner forces operating in the Badia region about the possibility of an Islamic State attack. He said the U.S.-led coalition did not take those warnings seriously.",
      "The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had reported that the attacker is a member of Syrian security forces. Al-Baba said the person had no leadership role within Syria's internal security forces and was not serving as an escort to leadership at the time of the attack.",
      "The Pentagon has not released additional details beyond statements on social media.",
      "Trump addressed the attack ahead of Saturday's Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, calling it an ambush and mourning the deaths. Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. would retaliate, he said, \"Yeah, we will.\"",
      "The U.S. military has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly stationed in the northeast, where they work with local security to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State. The U.S. and other nations have re-engaged with Damascus under al-Sharaa since rebels ousted former President Bashar al-Assad."

      "Tripoli's Red Castle museum has reopened for the first time since the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, unveiling a trove of treasures that span millennia, from ancient mummies to relics of Libya's turbulent and fascinating history.",
      "Formerly known as As-Saraya Al-Hamra, the fortress that houses the museum has long been a central landmark in Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. It houses an extensive collection of artifacts tracing 5,000 years of history, from prehistoric times through to Libya\u2019s Roman, Greek and Islamic eras.",
      "Collections include Islamic art and architecture as well as objects from Italian colonial rule, World War II and Libya's independence, with galleries dedicated to the prehistoric period and ancient Libyan tribes, such as the Garamantes.",
      "\u201cThe reopening of the National Museum is not just a cultural moment but a live testimony that Libya is building its institutions,\u201d Abdulhamid al-Dbiebah, prime minister of the Government of National Unity, said at a ceremony on Friday awash with fireworks at the site.",
      "The museum closed in February 2011 during the NATO-backed uprising against Gadhafi, as anti-government protesters in the northeastern city of Benghazi began calling for the leader to step down and for the release of political prisoners. As protests intensified, demonstrators took control of Benghazi and unrest spread to Tripoli, with the Libyan government using lethal force against demonstrators.",
      "When rebels launched their first attack on the Libyan capital in August that year, a group of armed men were reported to have entered the national museum, incorrectly believing it to conceal the entrance of a secret government tunnel. The museum\u2019s artifacts were largely left intact, though a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Gadhafi was among the regime-linked objects vandalized.",
      "Gadhafi was eventually toppled with the help of an international coalition that included the U.S.",
      "Renovations for the museum, built in the 1980s and opened by Gadhafi, began in March 2023 by the Tripoli-based GNU.",
      "The reopening of the national museum indicates a recovery in the country\u2019s cultural sector, despite unresolved political dynamics. The country remains divided between administrations in the west and east that have not had a unified budget in more than a decade.",
      "But with a planned election on the horizon in 2026, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, said the museum's opening carries a political message.",
      "The reopening is \"kind of like a proof of concept of the western government that they are stable, especially in the forerun of elections,\" she told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the GNU.",
      "\"There really isn\u2019t anything that isn\u2019t political right now in Libya,\" she added. \u201cThis is very much a kind of a symbol that everyone can get behind.\"",
      "Since renovations began, Libya has recovered 21 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, notably from France, Switzerland and the United States, the chairman of the board of directors of the antiquities department, Mohamed Farj Shakshoki, told Reuters ahead of the opening.",
      "Libya houses five UNESCO World Heritage sites, which in 2016 were all declared \"endangered\" due to instability and conflict.",
      "The historic town of Ghadames in western Libya was among the sites under threat, but conservation work spearheaded by the Managing Libya's Cultural Heritage project led to the site being officially removed from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in July."

    "story": [
      "When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict.",
      "Six years later, Zelenskyy \u2014 transformed by the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2014 is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington\u2019s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for \u201cusing war not to hold an election.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cillegitimate\u201d and thus impossible to negotiate with.",
      "Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect.",
      "Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine\u2019s cities.",
      "\u201cI do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine\u2019s allies help provide security on the ground.",
      "Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack.",
      "After Trump\u2019s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals \u201cenabling changes to the legal framework\u201d that would make elections possible.",
      "Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army.",
      "First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won\u2019t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin\u2019s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting.",
      "\u201cElections always involve crowds,\u201d said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \u201cWhat do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on how the U.S. might help.",
      "Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote.",
      "Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions.",
      "To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached.",
      "Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,\u201d Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp.",
      "Kravchuk pointed to the country\u2019s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. \u201cUkrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,\u201d she said.",
      "Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote.",
      "It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. \u201cBut discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,\u201d Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are very far from the real end of this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko.",
      "Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy\u2019s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don\u2019t seem to agree.",
      "An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found  that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll.",
      "Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said \u2014 Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief.",
      "Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy\u2019s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these two,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else has much lower ratings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,\u201d marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. \u201cNo rockets, no [drones] \u2014 and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,\u201d Datsko added. \u201cFirst, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be \u201cpointless\u201d because he has lost his legitimacy after being too \u201cafraid\u201d to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy\u2019s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal \u2014 something Moscow has frequently rejected.",
      "Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials\u2019 democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cAnd calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,\u201d Dill added."
