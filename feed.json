      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Beach Boys' Mike Love was inducted into the 2025 Songwriters Hall of Fame on Thursday night, just one day after it was announced that his inimitable bandmate Brian Wilson had died.",
      "The actor \u2014 and lifelong Beach Boys fan \u2014 John Stamos introduced him. \u201cThere are songs that don't just play on the radio,\u201d Stamos said in his speech. \u201cMike Love is a songwriter's songwriter.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat an incredible honor this is,\u201d Clinton said in his speech. He talked about his early days in the legendary Brill Building song factory, which he described like going \u201cinto Oz.\u201d Being a songwriter, to him, required \u201cconsistent effort.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up chasing fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up chasing feeling ... Creativity has no limitations.\u201d",
      "His four children, R.J., Heavenly, Hannah Joy and Royal Jerkins, performed one of his best-known hits, Brandy and Monica's \u201cThe Boy Is Mine.\"",

      "When Gorley took the stage for his speech, he said he felt like he was in a \u201cfever dream\u201d or that he has \u201ccrashed a royal wedding.\u201d",
      "Legendary English songwriter Tony Macaulay was also honored. He is best known for such classics as The Foundations\u2019 \u201cBaby Now That I\u2019ve Found You\" and \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup,\u201d the latter of which was performed for Macaulay by a spirited Debbie Gibson.",

      "Gracie Abrams received the eminent Hal David Starlight Award.",
      "Last year\u2019s inductees included Steely Dan, R.E.M., Timbaland, Hillary Lindsey and Dean Pitchford. At the induction ceremony last summer, R.E.M. stunned attendees by reuniting for an acoustic version of their alt-rock hit, \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969 to honor those creating popular music. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song. Some already in the hall include Gloria Estefan, Carole King, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, Elton John and Bernie Taupin, Brian Wilson, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Lionel Richie, Bill Withers, Neil Diamond and Phil Collins.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own. The last Grammy for best recording package went to \u201cBrat,\u201d the Charli xcx album whose distinctive cover was immediately embraced by pop culture and meme creators.",
      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",
      "To transform it into a summer staple, engineers reinforced it: The aluminum ring and tether points were rebuilt with tougher components to handle rain, sun and temperature changes over several seasons.",
      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",

      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",

      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country\u2019s most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died",
      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "So he went to a megachurch youth group, which promised teenage shenanigans without much danger. The \u201csanitized mischief,\u201d as he describes it, was perfect for Morris, who grew up as a nerdy, nervous kid.",
      "\u201cYouth group was great for me,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe can put on a show, we can sing little songs, we can do little skits.

      "Morris also said he\u2019d rarely seen stories set in the kind of youth group he\u2019d grown up in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just never seen that little world written about in a way that I thought was like, accurate or, like, that got what it was about,\u201d he said.",
      "Published last year by New York-based First Second Books, \u201cYouth Group\u201d tells the story of Kay Radford, a theater kid who winds up joining the Stone Mission megachurch youth group after her parents split up. Her mom is a true believer but lonely. Kay is more skeptical but lonely as well and angry at her dad.",
      "\u201cChurch might help with all this,\u201d Kay\u2019s mom tells her early on. \u201cI think we both could use some community.\u201d",
      "At the youth group, Kay is met by youth leader Meg Parks, a kind but sometimes over-the-top youth leader in pink; a bearded, hippy pastor who turns the \u201cPina Colada song\u201d \u2014 the Rupert Holmes hit \u201cEscape\u201d \u2014 into a metaphor for spiritual seeking; and a band that churns out parodies like \u201cI Saw the Christ\u201d sung to the melody of Ace of Base\u2019s \u201cThe Sign.\u201d",
      "Though fictional, the songs fit the kind of pop culture reference \u2014 sometimes known as a \u201cJesus juke\u201d \u2014 that youth groups can be known for.",
      "\u201cI always think there\u2019s something funny about that move, where you take a secular piece of entertainment, like a song that\u2019s in the zeitgeist, or a popular movie and try and give the hidden religious message,\u201d Morris said.",
      "Kay eventually discovers the youth pastor and some of the older Stone Mission kids also fight demons. That fight becomes personal after one of the demons goes after her dad, and Kay decides to join the battle. Along the way, the Stone Mission kids team up with youth groups from other faiths \u2014 Temple Beth Israel, Immaculate Heart parish and the Polaris Coven \u2014 to fight off a demon invasion with the help of some training by an order of nuns.",
      "Morris said he and illustrator Bowen McCurdy wanted to tell a story that was more than just satire. And while he no longer embraces the faith of his youth, Morris still sees value in the lessons he learned, like the importance of loving your neighbor.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to tell a story of people from a lot of different religions coming together with a common goal,\u201d he said.",
      "Matthew Cressler, a religion scholar and creator of the webcomic series \u201cBad Catholics, Good Trouble,\u201d said comics with evangelical or denominational settings like \u201cYouth Group\u201d are uncommon. Religion in comics, he said, is often seen as \u201ca marker of difference\u201d: for example, Kamala Khan, the Muslim-American hero known as Ms. Marvel, or Matt Murdock, better known as Daredevil, who is Irish-Catholic. In the 1960s, when Daredevil was created, Catholics were still seen as outsiders to the American mainstream, and many of the most popular heroes, like Batman, were seen as Mainline Protestants.",
      "While there were comics for evangelicals, they were often evangelistic, like the controversial Jack Chick tracts or the Christianized adventures of Archie and his friends, published by Spire Comics starting in the 1970s. And evangelicals have often downplayed the kind of sacramental imagery and architecture found in mainline or Catholic settings and try to avoid the kind of visuals needed for comics, said Cressler.",
      "Matthew Brake, founder and editor of online publication Pop Culture and Theology, said non-denominational churches often have a \u201clet\u2019s go to the mall aesthetic\u201d and lack the visual clout of Catholicism.",
      "\u201cNondenominational churches are sort of a cultural underdog,\u201d he said.",
      "That may change, Brake said, as creators like Morris, who grew up in non-denominational settings, come of age. And those settings often contain surprises. Although they are most known for things like worship music and purity culture, megachurches also provide space to talk about things like social justice.",
      "Still, he wonders if many nondenominational Christians would be the kinds of fans that would enjoy a book like \u201cYouth Group\u201d or \u201cPreacher,\u201d a late-1990s comic about an evangelical pastor who ends up possessed by a supernatural being.",
      "David Canham, who reviews comics for the secular pop-culture website AIPT \u2014 short for \u201cAdventures in Poor Taste\u201d \u2014 had mixed feelings about \u201cYouth Group.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst off, there\u2019s plenty of \u201990s nostalgia \u2014 a good-natured tongue-in-cheek look back at many of the silly and absurd things about \u201990s culture, with a focus on evangelical Christian culture,\u201d he wrote when the book came out. \u201c\u2018Youth Group\u2019 delivers on this point.\u201d",
      "But the book\u2019s take on pluralism \u2014 the idea that all religion is on the same side \u2014 turned him off as an evangelical Christian. \u201cI don\u2019t want to recommend a book that promotes a worldview that so strongly disagrees with my own beliefs,\u201d he wrote.",
      "At first, Morris said he was worried the book might offend Christians and atheists alike. Some evangelicals might feel the book mocks their faith, while atheists might think the book overlooks the shortcomings of religious groups.",
      "Both those criticisms would be fair, he said. Religious groups get a lot of things wrong, and yet churches and other faith groups remain important to their members. Morris said he tried to walk a fine line of gently poking fun at faith while showing why it still has an impact on people\u2019s lives, and how the friendships made in youth groups may long endure.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want the humor to be like, church is stupid, or say, \u2018look at this dumb church stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted it to be funny and familiar.\u201d",
      "Morris said he wanted to capture the mixed feelings people have about the faiths in which they grew up. While he appreciated Bible teachings like caring for the needy, some of the politics and social messages, especially about LGBTQ+ folks, were a turnoff, he said.",
      "Religion, he said, is complicated.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful memories, and there\u2019s a lot of stuff that gives me the ick,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that\u2019s in the book. I hope you can see how a religious upbringing can be upsetting and wonderful \u2014 comforting but also makes you mad.\u201d",

      "YEONCHEON, South Korea -- Hundreds of fans gathered in the early morning hours to catch a glimpse of K-pop superstars Jimin and Jung Kook, the latest and final members of BTS to be discharged from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service.",
      "The pair wore their military uniforms Wednesday, saluted and addressed fans who had assembled to see the pair after their discharge.",
      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country musician Conner Smith fatally hit a pedestrian while driving his truck in Nashville over the weekend, and he currently faces no charges as an investigation continues, police said.",
      "Metro Nashville Police said Smith, 24, hit Dorothy Dobbins, 77, Sunday evening while she was crossing the road inside a marked crosswalk. Dobbins, a retired attorney, later died at a hospital. The Tennessee Bar Association posted on its website that Dobbins had been out walking her dog when she was hit.",
      "Police say Smith showed no signs of impairment. They believe the \u201cpreliminary contributing factor\u201d appears to be that Smith did not yield the right of way to the pedestrian.",
      "Smith\u2019s attorney, Worrick Robinson, said his client is cooperating with the investigation.",
      "\u201cHis heart goes out to Ms. Dobbins\u2019 family during this incredibly difficult time,\" Robinson said in a statement.",
      "Dobbins was a leader in the city\u2019s legal aid and family law communities, where she practiced for over 40 years, according to posts by the Bar Association and the Legal Aid Society of Middle Tennessee and the Cumberlands. She played a \u201cfoundational role in opening Nashville\u2019s first domestic violence shelter,\u201d according to a Facebook post from the Legal Aid Society, and she wrote the state\u2019s first order of protection legislation.",

      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",

      "The admission from Victoria Heuermann isn\u2019t made on camera but through a statement from producers near the end of \u201cThe Gilgo Beach Killer: House of Secrets,\u201d a three-part documentary on NBC\u2019s streaming service Peacock.",
      "\u201cA week before the series release, Victoria Heuermann told the producers that based on publicly available facts that have been presented and explained to her, she now believes her father is most likely the Gilgo Beach killer,\u201d reads a statement at the close of the final episode of the documentary.",
      "Bob Macedonio, an attorney for Heuermann\u2019s now ex-wife, Asa Ellerup, said in a statement after the documentary\u2019s release that \u201ctime will only tell\u201d whether his client will ever accept that her husband may have been a serial killer.",

      "In the documentary, Victoria Heuermann struggles to reconcile her childhood memories with the portrait of the killer described by authorities.",
      "She says her father was around the family \u201c90% of the time\u201d and was never violent toward any of them.",
      "At the same time, Victoria Heuermann acknowledged there were times when he stayed home while the family went on vacation and that she was around 10 to 13 years old when the killings happened. Prosecutors say Heuerman committed some of the killings in the basement while his family was out of town.",
      "\u201cWhether or not I believe my dad did it or not, I\u2019m on the fence about that,\u201d said the now 28-year-old. \u201cPart of me thinks he didn\u2019t do it, but at the same time, I don\u2019t know, he could have just totally had a double life.\u201d",
      "Ellerup, for her part, maintained she saw no \u201cabnormal behavior\u201d in their nearly three decades of marriage.",
      "She dismissed a computer file prosecutors claim is a \u201cblueprint\u201d of his crimes as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors say the document features a series of checklists for before, during and after a killing, such as a \u201cbody prep\u201d checklist that includes among other items a note to \u201cremove head and hands.\u201d",
      "Ellerup also shrugged off other evidence prosecutors have enumerated in court documents, including a vast collection of bondage and torture pornography found on electronic devices seized from their home, and hairs linked to Heuermann that were recovered on most of the victims\u2019 bodies.",
      "At the same time, she revealed that in July 2009, around the time one of his alleged victims went missing, Heuermann suddenly renovated a bathroom while she and their two children visited her family in Iceland. But she noted her former husband eventually joined the family for their final week of the trip.",
      "\u201cMy husband, he\u2019s a family man. He\u2019s my hero,\u201d Ellerup said. \u201cWhat I want to say to him is, \u2018I love you, no matter what.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ellerup divorced Heuermann after his arrest in 2023. But in the documentary, Victoria Heuermann says the separation was for financial reasons to protect the family\u2019s assets.",
      "Indeed, the filmmakers captured the family speaking to Heuermann by phone from jail, and the mother and daughter have been regularly attending court hearings with their attorney.",
      "The family, which also includes Ellerup\u2019s adult son from a prior marriage, is also planning to put up its notoriously ramshackle house in well-to-do Massapequa Park for sale as they look to move to a property they own in South Carolina.",
      "Ryan McCormick, an NBCUniversal spokesperson, declined to say how much family was compensated, though he said the payments could not go toward Heuermann or his defense funds.",

      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",

      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",

      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",

      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",

      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",
      "Other telehealth abortion providers said they also won't be deterred by legal threats.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",
      "A HHS spokesman did not respond to a question about whether there would be only eight ACIP members, or whether more will be named later.",

    "story": [
      "Big changes are being are being proposed to a food aid program as part of President Donald Trump's tax-cut legislation",
      "TPresident Donald Trump's plan to cut taxes by trillions of dollars could also trim billions in spending from social safety net programs, including food aid for lower-income people.",
      "The proposed changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would make states pick up more of the costs, require several million more recipients to work or lose their benefits, and potentially reduce the amount of food aid people receive in the future.",
      "The legislation, which narrowly passed the U.S. House, could undergo further changes in the Senate, where it's currently being debated. Trump wants lawmakers to send the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d to his desk by July 4, when the nation marks the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Here's a look at the food aid program, by the numbers:",
      "The federal aid program formerly known as food stamps was renamed the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, on Oct. 1, 2008. The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- Terminally ill New Yorkers would have the legal ability to end their own lives with pharmaceutical drugs under a bill passed Monday in the state Legislature.",
      "The proposal, which now moves to the governor's office, would allow a person with an incurable illness to be prescribed life-ending drugs if he or she requests the medication and gets approval from two physicians. A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would review the legislation.",
      "The New York Senate gave final approval to the bill Monday night after hours of debate during which supporters said it would let terminally ill people die on their own terms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about hastening death, but ending suffering,\u201d said state Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democrat who sponsored the proposal.",
      "Opponents have argued the state should instead improve end-of-life medical care or have objected on religious grounds.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is up to 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year",
      "The U.S. logged fewer than 30 measles cases this week as Ohio health officials confirmed three outbreaks in two counties were over.",
      "There have been 1,197 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation's biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed two cases in the last week.",
      "There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in 2,083 cases from mid-October through June 10. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.",
      "Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened 868 as of Thursday. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,179 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.",
      "Other U.S. states with active outbreaks \u2014 which the CDC defines as three or more related cases \u2014 include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.",
      "In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.",
      "Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that\u2019s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.",
      "There are a total of 744 cases across 35 counties, most of them in West Texas, state health officials said Tuesday.",
      "Throughout the outbreak, 96 people have been hospitalized.",
      "State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases \u2014 fewer than 10 \u2014 are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas\u2019 cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 411 cases since late January \u2014 just under 2% of the county\u2019s residents.",
      "The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of \u201cwhat the child\u2019s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.\u201d A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.",
      "New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.",
      "Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Don\u0303a Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.",
      "An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.",
      "Oklahoma stayed steady Friday with a total of 16 confirmed and three probable cases.",
      "The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.",
      "Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said Monday. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.",
      "Colorado has seen a total of 14 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of eight related cases.",
      "The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May, and includes four cases in Arapahoe County, three in El Paso County and one in Denver, plus a person who doesn't live in Colorado.",
      "Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.",
      "Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following week, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.",
      "The state's other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.",
      "Kansas has a total of 76 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but two of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.",
      "Montana had 20 measles cases as of Tuesday. Twelve were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up \u2014 Montana\u2019s first in 35 years.",
      "Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.",
      "There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.",
      "North Dakota, which hadn't seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized, and all of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.",
      "There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.",
      "Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.",
      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s National Institutes of Health director says some employees\u2019 critical letter to him has \u201cfundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- In his confirmation hearings to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. \u201cDissent,\" he said, \u201dis the very essence of science.\u201d",
      "That commitment is being put to the test.",
      "On Monday, scores of scientists at the agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, challenging \u201cpolicies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.\u201d",
      "It says: \"We dissent.\"",
      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "Albert Ojwang, 31, was arrested on June 6 in western Kenya and driven 400 kilometers (248 miles) to Nairobi for what police said was publishing \u201cfalse information\u201d about a top police official on social media. He died two days later at the police cell and police said he hit his head against the wall. A pathologist\u2019s report refuted the police account, stating that the deceased had \u201chead injury, neck compression and other injuries spread all over the body that are pointing towards assault.\u201d",

      "Ukraine\u2019s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said in a statement that Russia returned 1,200 bodies, and \u201caccording to the Russian side, the bodies belong to Ukrainian citizens, in particular military personnel.\u201d",

      "The 18-carat fully functioning toilet was on display as a piece of contemporary art at Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born \u2014 when five burglars smashed a window and yanked it from its plumbing in a brazen early morning raid in September 2019. It was never recovered and was believed to have been chopped up and sold.",

      "Michael Jones, 39, who worked for Sheen and was convicted of burglary at trial, was sentenced to two years and three months.",
      "The toilet weighed just over 215 pounds (98 kilograms) and was worth more than its weight in gold. The value of the gold at the time was 2.8 million ($3.5 million), but it was insured for 4.7 million pounds (more than $6 million).",
      "The toilet was part of a satirical commentary on consumer culture, titled \u201cAmerica,\u201d by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, whose work of a banana duct-taped to a wall was sold in 2024 for $6.2 million at auction in New York.",

      "The thieves used sledgehammers and a crowbar to wrench the toilet from its foundation, causing considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.",

      "Ramaphosa's visit will come amid criticism of authorities' early response to the disaster, which was caused by an extreme weather front that brought heavy rain, strong winds and even snow to parts of the province. Forecasters warned about the extreme weather last week.",
      "The head of the provincial government said the rescue effort was \u201cparalyzed\u201d in the first few hours after the floods because of a lack of resources like specialized search and rescue teams, divers and K-9 dog units in one of the country's poorest regions.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has made waves with some of his fashion choices, returning to much of the traditional pomp of popes past",
      "VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Leo XIV stepped out on the central loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to greet the crowd for the first time after his May 8 election, liturgical fashion aficionados around the globe took note: Gone was the simple white cassock and silver cross favored by Pope Francis. Back was the red satin mozzetta shoulder cape, the burgundy stola with gold embroidery and a gold cross held by a double-stranded silken gold cord.",
      "Over Leo\u2019s first few weeks, the excitement grew among liturgical fashion-conscious Catholics as they noticed new additions to the wardrobe, or rather a return to the old additions of the papal wardrobe: cufflinks, white pants, lace.",
      "After Francis' revolutionary papacy, Vatican watchers are now wondering if Leo's return to the past sartorial look means a return to the past on other things too, including more substantial policy issues. But for tailors at the elite handful of liturgical tailoring shops in Rome, there is hope that Leo's return to the fancier garb of popes past will mean a boon to business if Leo's traditional look has a trickle-down effect from the pope to priests and all those in between.",
      "According to the Rev. John Wauck, professor of church communication at the Pontifical Holy Cross University in Rome, Leo's clothing choices are a \u201creturn to form,\u201d and his attire similar to that worn by Pope Benedict XVI, Pope John Paul II and other popes going back to the middle ages.",
      "They show \u201ca respect for tradition,\u201d he said.",
      "Such respect for the papal office is important for many conservative Catholics. Many conservatives and traditionalists soured on Francis' informal style and disdain for tradition, which reached its pinnacle with his his crackdown on the old Latin Mass. The old liturgy was celebrated before the modernizing reforms of the 1960s Second Vatican Council; Francis greatly restricted access to the old liturgy, saying it had become a source of division in parishes.",
      "Leo has shown strong familiarity with Latin, and has taken to singing the Sunday noontime prayer in Latin. Some traditionalist Catholics are hoping Leo will take the pro-Latin path even further and reverse Francis to allow greater use of the traditional Latin Mass.",
      "Massimo Faggioli, professor of theology at Villanova University, where Leo went to college, said it's too early to tell if Leo will reverse Francis' reform.",
      "\u201cIt remains to be seen if Leo\u2019s more traditional attire and liturgical style means that he will change Francis\u2019 strong decisions limiting the so-called \u2018Latin Mass,\u2019\" he said.",
      "That said, Faggioli said U.S. conservatives seems particularly happy with Leo\u2019s traditional attire, given Francis\u2019 disdain for the fashion pomp of the papacy.",
      "\u201cIn this sense, Francis might have been a parenthesis or an interlude, more than a changer of the tradition in \u2018papal style,\u2019\u201d he said in an email.",
      "At his inaugural Mass on May 18, 2025, Pope Leo XIV reached out his arm to sprinkle holy water and revealed a shirt with cufflinks, which Francis had largely avoided. He was also wearing an amitto, and an alb held in place by a cingulum. For the non-experts, the amitto is a lacy linen cloth that goes around the neck, the alb is the white tunic worn under the ceremonial vestment, and the cingulum is a braided rope with tassels that serves as a belt.",
      "If it weren\u2019t for photographers\u2019 long lenses relentlessly trained on the pope\u2019s every gesture, Leo\u2019s switch from Francis\u2019s standard black pants to more traditional white papal trousers would have gone completely unnoticed.",
      "In addition to the clothing changes, Leo has returned to some other traditions of the Vatican that Francis eschewed.",
      "He has shown himself willing to accept the traditional \u201cbaciamano\u201d or kissing of his ring. Francis disliked having his ring kissed and often pulled his hand away if someone tried to kiss it.",
      "\u201cI think that what we see with Pope Leo is a willingness to embrace tradition, even if it risks seeming perhaps more formal than Pope Francis,\u201d Wauck said. The idea is that \u201cseeing that tradition as a treasure to be conserved and embraced as opposed to something that makes one feel perhaps a little bit standoffish.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether Leo will move into the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace, which stood empty during the 12-year Francis papacy. Francis shocked the world by choosing to live in a small room at the Santa Marta residence at the Vatican, eating his meals in the common dining room.",
      "For the Rev. Castro Prudencio, this is all much ado about nothing. \"For Pope Francis it was simplicity. Always. And Pope Leo has taken up what Pope Benedict had and many others. That is what the church is like,\u201d he said.",

      "TORONTO -- U.S. President Donald Trump will arrive Sunday for a Group of Seven summit in a country he has suggested should be annexed and as he wages a trade war with America\u2019s longstanding allies.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president\u2019s increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.",
      "Carney asserted this week that Washington no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, imposing tariffs for access to its markets and reducing its contributions to collective security.",
      "Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqu\u00e9, at the summit\u2019s conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.",
      "The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.",
      "Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit\u2019s final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqu\u00e9 after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.",
      "The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.",
      "The Group of Seven comprises Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Germany and Britain. The European Union also attends as well as other heads of state who are not part of the G7 but have been invited by Carney.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend and is expected to meet with Trump, a reunion coming just months after their contentious Oval Office encounter, which laid bare the risks of having a meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "Other world leaders will be meeting with Trump both in a group setting and for bilateral talks, which are often precarious as foreign leaders must navigate between placating and confronting him.",
      "\u201cAnything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",
      "\u201cIt all depends what kind of theater he\u2019s going to want to have,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum will attend and said she expects to have her first in-person meeting with Trump. On his way to Canada, Macron is making a notable stop in Greenland, the semi autonomous Danish territory that the U.S. president has also suggested annexing.",
      "Among the other newcomers are German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Starmer will meet with Carney on Saturday in Ottawa before flying to Alberta.",
      "Carney also invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite accusations from Canada's national police force that agents of Modi's government were involved in \u201cwidespread\u201d violence in Canada.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, was invited but will not attend.",
      "The 2018 G7 summit in Quebec was thrown into disarray after Trump called Trudeau \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak,\" while complaining that he had been blindsided by Trudeau\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s tariff threats at a summit-ending news conference. Trump pulled out of the G7 group statement just as it was released.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t too happy because we thought we managed to pull off a pretty good summit,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s deputy minister for the Quebec summit.\" The reaction \u2014 and I was with Mr. Trudeau at the time \u2014 was a bit of disbelief.\"",
      "Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders.",
      "During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.",
      "\u201cTrump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,\" Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.\u201d",
      "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra has said that Carney has been quietly holding direct talks with Trump about a trade deal in the lead up to the summit. Separately, top Canadian cabinet ministers have also been in Washington for negotiations in recent weeks.",
      "Trade tensions may be unavoidable. The United States runs trade deficits with all G7 countries except the United Kingdom. In an effort to balance what he describes as America\u2019s lopsided trade relations, Trump has imposed 10% import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on almost every country in the world. He also announced bigger tariffs, then suspended them, on countries that sell more to the United States than they buy.",
      "\u201cThe big X Factor (is) the looming tariffs,\u201d said Max Bergmann of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe G7 is supposed to provide global economic governance. And the way the Europeans see it right now is that the country that\u2019s the source of major instability in global economic affairs is the United States.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s trade wars are already threatening the world economy. The World Bank on Tuesday sharply downgraded its forecast for global economic growth this year, citing \u201ca substantial rise in trade barriers.\u2019\u2019",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend the G7 meeting ahead of this month's NATO summit and has said most U.S. allies in the alliance endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs.",
      "Carney said this week Canada would meet NATO's current 2% target but seemed to suggest he would not support 5%, saying his goal is to protect Canadians, and not to satisfy NATO accountants.",
      "Law enforcement overseeing security expect large protests but say protesters won't be able to get anywhere near Kananaskis, as access roads to the summit will be closed to the public.",
      "The Mounties say there will be designated G7 demonstration zones in Calgary and Banff, Alberta that will have live audio and video feeds, which will be broadcast to G7 leaders and delegations at the summit. Kananaskis also hosted a G8 summit in 2002.",

    "story": [
      "Israel attacked Iran nuclear and military sites on Friday as tensions reached new heights over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Israel attacked multiple Iranian nuclear and military sites on Friday as tensions reached new heights over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "Israeli leaders said the attack was necessary to head off what they claimed was an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs. Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran was not actively pursuing the bomb.",
      "The attack came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more-advanced ones.",
      "The U.S. and Iran had been in talks that could have resulted in the U.S. lifting some of its crushing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran drastically limiting or ending its enrichment of uranium.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran\u2019s program.",
      "Iran\u2019s nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 220 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of Tehran, is the country\u2019s main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran\u2019s Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz\u2019s southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "Iran\u2019s nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn\u2019t as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries, Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Iran\u2019s only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr on the Persian Gulf, some 750 kilometers (465 miles) south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran\u2019s Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the United Nations\u2019 International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "The Arak heavy water reactor is 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of Tehran. Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue the weapon. Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.",
      "The facility in Isfahan, some 350 kilometers (215 miles) southeast of Tehran, employs thousands of nuclear scientists. It also is home to three Chinese research reactors and laboratories associated with the country\u2019s atomic program.",
      "The Tehran Research Reactor is at the headquarters of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, the civilian body overseeing the country\u2019s atomic program. The U.S. actually provided Iran the reactor in 1967 as part of America\u2019s \u201cAtoms for Peace\u201d program during the Cold War. It initially required highly enriched uranium but was later retrofitted to use low-enriched uranium over proliferation concerns.",

      "HONG KONG -- China's national security authorities in Hong Kong and the city's police launched their first publicly known joint operation, raiding the homes of six people on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.",
      "The police\u2019s statement on late Thursday did not disclose the identity of the six people suspected of breaking the 2020 Beijing-imposed national security law between November 2020 and June 2024. Beyond their homes, officers searched the office of the organization involved and seized exhibits such as bank documents and devices for further investigation, according to the statement. The six people were required to surrender their travel documents.",
      "Beijing's national security arm in Hong Kong also had requested assistance from the city\u2019s national security police, including in arranging interviews with the people in the case, the police said. But the local force did not elaborate details of their accusations and which organization it was, saying the investigation was still underway.",
      "Since the 2020 security law took effect, many leading activists have been prosecuted or jailed for national security offenses . Last week, prominent young activist Joshua Wong, who was already convicted and sentenced over a subversion case last year, was charged for the second time under the law. He faces up to life in prison over the fresh charge of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the law was necessary for returning stability to the city following massive anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In May, Hong Kong enacted subsidiary legislation for a separate, homegrown national security law, which was passed last year. The subsidiary legislation requires public servants, if requested, to provide all necessary and reasonable assistance to Beijing\u2019s national security office in Hong Kong. Local public servants must offer such help if the office needs to ascertain whether a case involves a special circumstance that could allow it to have jurisdiction over the case.",
      "Over the past week, the Hong Kong authorities have stepped up their national security work as the fifth anniversary of the enactment of the Beijing-imposed law neared, including targeting a mobile game application which they accused of advocating armed revolution and promoting secessionist agendas.",

      "North Korea says it has repaired a damaged destroyer and launched the ship in the presence of leader Kim Jong Un",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said it has repaired its damaged second naval destroyer and launched the ship into the water in the presence of leader Kim Jong Un, about three weeks after it capsized during a botched launch ceremony.",
      "In a lavish ceremony Thursday, Kim boarded the warship and told troops that nothing can block his country's push to bolster its naval combat power in the face of U.S.-led hostilities, the Korean Central News Agency said Friday.",
      "The country's extremely secretive nature makes it virtually impossible to independently confirm the announcement on the ship\u2019s repair. Outside observers doubt whether the ship\u2019s engine, weapons systems and other electronic equipment can function normally, as parts of the warship were submerged for about two weeks.",
      "North Korea's failed launch May 21 sparked fury from Kim, who has vowed to build a stronger navy to cope with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country.",
      "Kim said the incident was caused by criminal negligence and ordered officials to repair the warship before a ruling Workers\u2019 Party meeting in late June. North Korean authorities later detained four officials including the vice director of the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s munitions industry department over the botched launch.",
      "In his Thursday speech, Kim said the country\u2019s two destroyers will play a big role in improving the navy\u2019s operational capabilities, according to KCNA.",
      "Kim reiterated previous claims that his naval buildup is a justified response to perceived threats posed by the U.S. and South Korea, which in recent years have expanded their combined military exercises and updated their deterrence strategies to counter Kim\u2019s advancing nuclear program. He said the North will respond to such external threats with \u201coverwhelming military action.\"",
      "\u201cIt will not be long before the enemy nations themselves experience just how provoking and unpleasant it is to sit back and watch as our warships freely move near the edges of their sovereign waters,\u201d Kim said.",
      "Kim said a North Korean shipyard worker died during the repairs and offered his \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to his family, including his wife and son who were present at the launch event.",
      "Outside experts earlier said it remained unclear how severely the 5,000-ton-class destroyer was damaged and questioned North Korea's claim it needed 10 days to pump out the seawater, set the ship upright and fix its damages it described as \u201cnot serious.\u201d",
      "Previous satellite photos showed the North Korean destroyer lying on its side at the northeastern port of Chongjin, with its stern partly under water. Last week, North Korea said it had righted the warship and would move it to the Rajin port, which is further north of Chongjin and close to the border with Russia, for the next stage of its restoration works.",
      "\u201cConsidering the time they needed to raise the vessel, they would have had less than two weeks to carry out the real repair work,\u201d said Yang Uk, an analyst at Seoul\u2019s Asan Institute for Policy Studies. \u201cWould that have been enough time to completely fix everything and bring the vessel to a state where it\u2019s operationally capable? I think that\u2019s highly unlikely.\u201d",
      "Lee Illwoo, an expert with the Korea Defense Network in South Korea, said what was likely flooded in the North Korean ship were its engine room, missile launch tubes and anti-air weapons systems, which all involve electronic systems that are highly vulnerable to damages if exposed to seawater.",
      "Lee said the ship's move to Rajin implies Russian experts have likely been assisting North Korea with repairs.",
      "Military cooperation between North Korea and Russia has been flourishing significantly in recent years, with the North supplying troops and ammunitions to support Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "The damaged warship was in the same class as the country\u2019s first destroyer unveiled in April, which experts assessed as the North\u2019s largest and most advanced warship to date. Experts say the North's two destroyers were both likely built with Russian help.",
      "Kim Jong Un said the ruling Workers\u2019 Party has confirmed plans to build two more 5,000-ton-class destroyers next year, according to Friday's KCNA dispatch.",
      "Satellite imagery indicated North Korea had attempted to launch the second destroyer sideways, a method it had never used for warships. Many observers said it would be more difficult to maintain the balance of a big warship because it carries heavy weapons systems. But they said North Korea won't likely repeat the same mistake when it launches its third and fourth destroyers.",
      "According to North Korea's timetable, its first two destroyers are to be deployed next year.",
      "Despite its growing nuclear arsenal and huge 1.2 million-member standing army, North Korea's naval and aerial forces have been considered inferior to those of South Korea's. But North Korea's planned deployment of a series of 5,000-ton-class destroyers would pose \u201creally a serious threat\" to South Korea, whose navy hasn't still prepared itself to deal with such big, advanced enemy warships, according to Lee, the expert.",
      "Earlier this week, the new liberal South Korean government led by President Lee Jae-myung halted frontline propaganda broadcasts as its first concrete step toward easing tensions between the rivals. North Korea hasn't responded formally to the measure.",

      "Speaking at the Socialist Party headquarters in Madrid, S\u00e1nchez repeatedly asked Spaniards for forgiveness and said that he had learned of the corruption charges against Cerd\u00e1n only hours before. S\u00e1nchez said that Cerd\u00e1n is defending his innocence.",
      "The public act of contrition by S\u00e1nchez comes around 14 months after he took five days off to consider his political future when a judge launched an investigation into his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, for alleged influence peddling. Instead of resigning, he said he would fight on and denounced what he called a \u201csmear campaign\u201d by media outlets aligned with right-wing political leanings.",
      "On Thursday, the Spanish leader said that he would order an external audit of the Socialist Party's accounts, but he refused to call an early election like his political opponents have demanded for months.",
      "\u201cThere won't be elections until 2027, because this is not about me or the Socialist Party. This is about a project to bring positive change to the country,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Despite leading a minority government, S\u00e1nchez said that he was sure he could finish out his four-year term. He has so far maintained the backing of his government's junior members and a myriad of smaller regional and leftist parties in parliament.",
      "\u201cThere is no crisis in my government,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "As secretary of the Socialist Party organization, Cerd\u00e1n held the third-most powerful position in the prime minister's party.",
      "Shortly after the court made public that there were sufficient indications that Cerd\u00e1n was involved in the alleged kickback scheme, Cerd\u00e1n renounced his seat in parliament and his party posts. While never a minister, Cerd\u00e1n was charged with sensitive political negotiations, including the key talks between the Socialists and Catalan separatist parties that allowed S\u00e1nchez to form a new government in late 2023.",
      "One of Europe\u2019s longest-serving leaders, the 53-year-old S\u00e1nchez has displayed adroit negotiating skills to stay in power since 2018, when he led Spain\u2019s only successful no-confidence motion against his conservative Popular Party predecessor.",
      "This week, Spain's Supreme Court also announced that it would put the country's prosecutor general on trial over allegations of leaking confidential information in a tax fraud case involving the boyfriend of Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, the conservative head of the Madrid region and one of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s main political rivals.",
      "Last Sunday, tens of thousands of people protested in Madrid against S\u00e1nchez in a rally that was organized by the Popular Party under the slogan \u201cmafia or democracy.\"",

      "GRAZ, Austria -- The former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail, but he appears to have shot his victims at random and investigators still haven't been able to ascertain his motive, officials said Thursday.",
      "The 21-year-old had left the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz three years ago, breaking off his studies after attending for three years, police said. They said they knew of no personal connection between the gunman and the students he shot, but that one of the two teachers he shot had once taught him. They were still investigating whether that was a factor.",
      "The attack prompted Austria to declare three days of national mourning, and large numbers of candles have been laid in Graz's main square and outside the school.",
      "The assailant, an Austrian who lived with his mother near Graz and whom officials have declined to identify, used a Mercury double-barreled shotgun and a Glock 19 handgun in the shooting. Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province's criminal police office, said that he arrived at the school Tuesday morning with a backpack containing the weapons, and put on equipment including shooting glasses and a headset in a bathroom before starting a roughly seven-minute shooting spree.",
      "He opened fire indiscriminately on the building's third floor before shooting open the locked door of a fourth-floor classroom and again firing indiscriminately, Lohnegger told a news conference. Lohnegger said that he had enough ammunition to continue shooting and it was unclear why he hadn't; the assailant then returned to the bathroom and shot himself fatally in the head.",
      "A search of his home uncovered a farewell letter and video, which Lohnegger said added up to \u201can apology directed to his family for the crime and a general thank-you,\u201d but offered no \u201cindication for a motive.\u201d",
      "They also found a handwritten note that showed he had planned the attack \u201cdown to the smallest detail\" \u2014 setting out how he would proceed, but giving no date for the crime. It suggested that he had lacked enough time to build a fully functional pipe bomb, and investigators found one that wouldn't have worked.",
      "Lohnegger said a picture had emerged of \u201ca very introverted person\u201d who largely didn't take part in real-world activities, and that his great passion was taking part in online first-person shooter games.",
      "\u201cBut even here, there is no information from his personal surroundings that he ever expressed any anger or resentment toward the school, students or teachers,\u201d he added. The man had no previous police record and \u201cthere were definitely no particular problems with him at this school.\u201d",
      "The shooter was in unspecified vocational training at the time of the attack, investigators said.",
      "He had bought the shotgun legally in Graz in early April, and the handgun from another shop in the city in late May. He had a license to own weapons that required a report from a psychological expert, which apparently was produced in March.",
      "Starting in March, he took part in shooting practice five times at a shooting club in Graz, using a hired firearm, Lohnegger said.",
      "The slain students were six girls and three boys aged between 14 and 17. Eleven people were wounded in the attack, and authorities said on Wednesday that their lives weren't in danger.",

      "Consumer sentiment increased in June for the first time in six months, the latest sign that Americans\u2019 views of the economy have improved as inflation has stayed tame and the Trump administration has reached a truce in its trade fight with China",
      "WASHINGTON -- Consumer sentiment increased in June for the first time in six months, the latest sign that Americans\u2019 views of the economy have improved as inflation has stayed tame and the Trump administration has reached a truce in its trade fight with China.",
      "The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, jumped 16% from 52.2 to 60.5. The large increase followed steady drops that left the preliminary number last month at the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. Consumer sentiment is still down 20% compared with December 2024.",
      "\u201cConsumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,\u201d Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, said in a written statement. \u201cHowever, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy.\u201d",
      "Americans have largely taken a darker view of the economy\u2019s future after President Donald Trump unleashed a wide-ranging trade war, imposing steep tariffs on China, the European Union, and dozens of other countries. Yet in April Trump postponed a set of sweeping tariffs on about 60 nations and last month reached a temporary truce with China, after both sides had sharply ratcheted up tariffs on each other.",
      "The Conference Board's consumer confidence index, released in late May, also increased after five straight declines that were linked to anxiety over tariffs.",
      "U.S. duties remain elevated compared with historical levels, but so far they have not worsened overall inflation. Prices rose just 2.4% in May compared with a year ago, up slightly from 2.3% in April. Still, most economists expect tariffs to hit harder in the coming months.",
      "Consumer confidence is sharply divided by political outlook, with Republicans feeling much better about the economy under Trump than Democrats. Democratic sentiment about the economy was much higher under Biden, while Republican views were low. This month, however, sentiment did improve among supporters of both parties and independents.",
      "Consumers' inflation expectations \u2014 basically a measure of how worried people are about future inflation \u2014 dropped this month, which will be welcomed by the inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve. Inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling, because if people worry price increases will get worse, they can take steps \u2014 such as demanding higher pay \u2014 that push prices even higher.",
      "The Fed meets next week, and is expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged at about 4.3%.",

      "Sweden and the Netherlands say they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands",
      "BRUSSELS -- Less than two weeks before a NATO summit, Sweden and the Netherlands said Friday that they intend to increase defense spending to 5% of their gross domestic product, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands.",
      "Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands on June 24-25, where they\u2019re due to agree a new defense spending target. He insists that Europe must look after its own security, while Washington focuses on China and its own borders.",
      "Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that \u201cSweden will reach a new NATO spending target to 5% of GDP, where at least 3.5% of GDP will be allocated towards core defense requirements to fulfill NATO\u2019s new capability targets.\"",
      "\u201cWe are in a specific geographical situation where we need to meet the future threats from Russia,\u201d Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, standing alongside NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.",
      "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO's 32 allies agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their military budgets. But NATO\u2019s new plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investment of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "According to the most recent NATO figures, Sweden was estimated to have spent 2.25% of its GDP on defense last year. The Netherlands spent 2.06%, among 22 of the 32 allies who reached NATO\u2019s old benchmark.",
      "The Dutch caretaker government announced on Friday that it would increase spending on defense to 3.5% of GDP in an effort to meet the 5% goal. It\u2019s not clear where the approximately 18 billion euros ($20 billion) will come from.",
      "Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans called the decision \u201chistoric\u201d and told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that he hoped other NATO countries would also increase their spending.",
      "\u201cMy expectation is that this will happen,\u201d he said.",
      "Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte said last week that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time frame countries will get to reach the new spending goals. A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",
      "The United States insists that a near-term deadline must be set. But Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Thursday that his country would get to 5%,. but would require a decade to do so.",

    "story": [
      "In landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, a new inland desert fish farm is growing barramundi \u2014 a tropical species native to Australia",
      "DATELAND, Ariz. -- Storks scatter, white against blue water, as Dan Mohring's pickup truck rumbles down the dirt road. He's towing a trailer full of ground-up beef, chicken, fish and nutrient bits behind him, ready to be shot out of a cannon into the ponds below.",
      "It's time to feed the fish.",
      "Mohring fires up the machine and the food flies out in a rainbow arc. Then the water comes alive. Hundreds of thrashing, gobbling barramundi wiggle their way to the surface, all fighting for a piece. Until, in a few months, they will become food themselves.",
      "In the desert of landlocked Arizona, where the Colorado River crisis has put water use under a microscope, Mainstream Aquaculture has a fish farm where it's growing the tropical species barramundi, also known as Asian sea bass, for American restaurants.",
      "Mainstream sees it as a sustainable alternative to ocean-caught seafood. They say chefs and conscious consumers like that the food has a shorter distance to travel, eliminating some of the pollution that comes from massive ships that move products around the world. And they and some aquaculture experts argue it's efficient to use the water twice, since the nutrient-rich leftovers can irrigate crops like Bermuda grass sold for livestock feed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the business of water,\u201d said Matt Mangan, head of Australia-based Mainstream\u2019s American business. \u201cWe want to be here in 20 years', 30 years' time.\u201d",
      "But some experts question whether growing fish on a large scale in an arid region can work without high environmental costs.",
      "That question comes down to what people collectively decide is a good use of water. In Arizona, some places manage water more aggressively than others. But the whole state is dealing with the impacts of climate change, which is making the region drier and water only more precious.",
      "The farm uses groundwater, not Colorado River water. It's a nonrenewable resource, and like mining, different people and industries have different philosophies about whether it should be extracted.",
      "\u201cAs long as groundwater is treated as an open resource in these rural parts of Arizona, they\u2019re susceptible to new industries coming in and using the groundwater for that industry,\u201d said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University's Morrison Institute.",
      "Some scientists believe aquaculture can play a role in protecting wild ocean ecosystems from overfishing. And it might play at least a small role in smoothing any supply problems that result from the Trump administration's tariffs on imports from dozens of countries, including those that send the U.S. about 80% of its seafood, per the United States Department of Agriculture.",
      "In the greenhouses at University of Arizona professor Kevin Fitzsimmons' lab in Tucson, tilapia circle idly in tanks that filter down into tubs full of mussels and floating patches of collard greens and lettuce. Fitzsimmons mentored the student who started the tilapia farm eventually bought by Mainstream about three years ago where they now raise barramundi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think desert agriculture is going away,\" he said. \u201cObviously, we want to do it as water-efficient as possible.\"",
      "But not everyone agrees it's possible.",
      "\u201cArtificial ponds in the desert are stupid,\u201d said Jay Famiglietti, a professor at ASU and director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative. He worried about heavy water losses to evaporation.",
      "Mangan says that evaporation hasn't been an issue so much as the loss of heat in the wintertime. That has required pumping more water since its warmth when it arrives at the surface helps keep the barramundi cozy. But Mangan says they've been improving pond design to retain heat better and have found, after the last year of research and development, that they can cut their water requirement by about half as a result.",
      "Plus, he argues, the water coming out of the fish ponds is \"essentially liquid fertilizer,\" and though it's slightly salty, they use it for crops that can tolerate it, like Bermuda grass dairy cows can eat.",
      "But that's supporting the cattle industry, which contributes more than its share of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, Famiglietti said.",
      "\u201cDoing two suboptimal things doesn't make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Purple flowers sprout alongside paddle wheels. Fish bones crunch underfoot. The faint odor of brackish water and ammonia catches in the breeze.",
      "Without groundwater, none of it would be possible.",
      "Some farmers in Arizona rely on water from the Colorado River, but many others use well water to irrigate crops like alfalfa for the dairy industry or the lettuce, cucumbers and melons shipped nationwide year-round.",
      "Arizona has seven areas around the state where groundwater is rigorously managed. Dateland doesn't fall into one of those, so the only rule that really governs it is a law saying if you land own there, you can pump a \u201creasonable\u201d amount of groundwater, said Rhett Larson, who teaches water law at ASU.",
      "What might be considered \u201creasonable\u201d depends from crop to crop, and there's really no precedent for aquaculture, an industry that hasn't yet spread commercially statewide.",
      "Using numbers provided by Mainstream, Porter calculated that the fish farm would demand a \u201cvery large amount\u201d of water, on par with a big ranch or potentially even more than some suburbs of Phoenix. And she noted that although the water use is being maximized by using it twice, it's still depleting the aquifer.",
      "When the company scoped out Arizona to expand, Mangan said they didn\u2019t see nearly the same kinds of regulations as back in Australia.",
      "As part of its growth strategy, Mainstream is also hoping to work with other farmers in the area so more can use nutrient-rich fish pond wastewater to produce hay. They say a few have expressed interest.",
      "The seafood industry needs to reduce its reliance on catching small wild fish to feed bigger farmed ones that humans eat, said Pallab Sarker, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies sustainability in the aquaculture industry. He said seabirds and mammals rely on small species like anchovies and mackerel commonly used in fish meal.",
      "\u201cWe should not rely on ocean fish to grow fish for aquaculture to meet the demand for humans,\u201d Sarker said.",
      "Mainstream gets its fish feed from two suppliers, Skretting and Star Milling, but Mangan and Mohring said they didn't know for certain where those suppliers got their base ingredients from.",
      "Fitzsimmons, of the University of Arizona, also pointed out that between pollution, overfishing and oceanfront development for recreation, the commercial fishing industry had already been facing problems. He doesn't think that Trump's moves this spring to open up marine protected areas for commercial fishing will improve that situation the way aquaculture could.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hunting and gathering from the ocean,\u201d Fitzsimmons said.",

      "Trading in New York is a long-held goal for JBS, which was founded 72 years ago and is now one of the world's largest meat companies. Half of its annual revenue comes from the U.S., where it has more than 72,000 employees. JBS is America\u2019s top beef producer and its second-largest producer of poultry and pork.",
      "JBS's minority shareholders voted last month to approve the company's plan to list its shares both in Sao Paulo and New York, casting aside opposition from environmental groups, U.S. lawmakers and others who noted JBS\u2019 record of corruption, monopolistic behavior and environmental destruction.",
      "JBS said a dual listing would give it broader access to investors and more competitive interest rates, which would help it finance its growth. It has also said a U.S. listing would subject it to more oversight from regulators. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved JBS's planned listing last month.",
      "Still, the proposed listing has received significant pushback. Earlier this week, Mighty Earth, an environmental group, said it sent a letter to the NYSE board urging it to decline the listing. Mighty Earth contends that JBS is illegally profiting from deforested land in Brazil.",
      "Glass Lewis, an influential independent investor advisory firm, was also among those recommending that JBS's shareholders reject the planned listing.",
      "In its report, Glass Lewis said the recent return of brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista to the JBS board should concern investors. The brothers, who are the sons of JBS\u2019 founder, were briefly jailed in Brazil in 2017 on bribery and corruption charges.",
      "Glass Lewis also objected to the company\u2019s plan for dual share classes, which give the Batistas and other controlling shareholders more voting power.",
      "JBS said the outcome showed shareholders were confident in the benefits a dual listing would bring.",

      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Prime Minister Mark Carney, who won his office by pledging to confront the U.S. president\u2019s increased aggression, now hosts the G7 summit.",

      "Carney has decided to abandon the annual practice of issuing a lengthy joint statement, or communiqu\u00e9, at the summit\u2019s conclusion as French President Emmanuel Macron did at the G7 summit in France in 2019.",
      "The document typically outlines the consensus reached by leaders on summit issues and provides a roadmap for how they plan to tackle them.",
      "Trump roiled the 2017 meeting in Italy over the climate change passage in that summit\u2019s final statement. He then withdrew his support from the 2018 communiqu\u00e9 after complaining he had been slighted by then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the host that year.",
      "The leaders of the world's richest countries begin arriving Sunday in the resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies.",

      "\u201cAnything could happen. The Canadians would be crazy not to anticipate something. We can\u2019t tell. That\u2019s Trump stock and trade. He likes to keep everyone guessing,\u201d said Robert Bothwell, a University of Toronto professor of Canadian history and international relations.",

      "Boehm expects a chair's summary from Carney this year instead of a joint statement from the leaders.",
      "During the Quebec summit, Trump also insisted on Russia's readmission to the elite group, from which it was ousted in 2014 following President Vladimir Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea.",
      "\u201cTrump raised that at the foreign policy dinner,\" Boehm recalled. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because British Prime Minister Theresa May was there and some British citizens had just been killed by Russian operatives using a toxic agent.\u201d",
      "Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were targeted in a nerve agent attack a few months before the Quebec summit in the English city of Salisbury.",

      "AHMEDABAD, India -- Investigators searched the site of one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with the lone surviving passenger Friday, a day after an Air India flight fell from the sky and killed 241 people on board and several people on the ground.",
      "The London-bound Boeing 787 struck a medical college hostel when it fell in a residential area of the northwestern city of Ahmedabad minutes after takeoff Thursday.",
      "DNA testing was being conducted to identify bodies that were mostly charred beyond recognition. More victims are expected to be found in the search at the crash site. There was no information on whether the black boxes \u2014 the flight data and cockpit voice recorders \u2014 had been recovered.",
      "The plane hit a building hosting a medical college hostel and burst into flames, killing several students, in the city that is the capital of Gujarat, Modi\u2019s home state.",
      "\u201cWe are all devastated by the air tragedy in Ahmedabad. The loss of so many lives in such a sudden and heartbreaking manner is beyond words,\u201d Modi said on social media after visiting the site. \u201cWe understand their pain and also know that the void left behind will be felt for years to come.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Phuket International Airport in southern Thailand said Friday it received a report that a pilot of Air India flight AI 379, which was bound for New Delhi, found a bomb threat message shortly after the morning flight took off.",
      "The plane requested an emergency landing back at Phuket and all 156 passengers were evacuated before authorities began an inspection of the plane, the airport said. The inspection results were not immediately announced.",
      "The survivor was seen in television footage meeting Modi at the government hospital where he was being treated for burns and other injuries.",
      "Viswashkumar Ramesh told India's national broadcaster he still can\u2019t believe he was alive. He said the aircraft seemed to become stuck immediately after takeoff. He said then the lights came on, and right after that it accelerated but seemed unable to gain height before it crashed.",
      "He said the side of the plane where he was seated fell onto the ground floor of a building and there was space for him to escape after the door broke open. He unfastened his seat belt and forced himself out of the plane.",

      "Indian conglomerate Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, returning the debt-saddled national carrier to private ownership after decades of government control. Since the takeover, Air India has ordered hundreds of new planes, redesigned its branding and livery and absorbed smaller airlines Tata held stakes in.",

Thursday\u2019s update said inflation at the wholesale level wasn\u2019t as bad last month as economists expected, and it followed a report on Wednesday saying something similar about the inflation that U.S. consumers are feeling.",

      "Besides the inflation data, a separate report on jobless claims also helped to weigh on Treasury yields. It said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week than economists expected, and the total number remained at the highest level in eight months. That could be an indication of a rise in layoffs.",
      "The Fed\u2019s next meeting on interest rates is scheduled for next week, but the nearly unanimous expectation on Wall Street is that it will stand pat again. Traders are betting it\u2019s likely to begin cutting in September, according to data from CME Group.",
      "Trump\u2019s on-and-off tariffs have raised worries about higher inflation and a possible recession, which had sent the S&P 500 roughly 20% below its record a couple months ago. But stocks have since rallied nearly all the way back on hopes that Trump will lower his tariffs after reaching trade deals with other countries.",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s tariffs are on hold at the moment to give time for negotiations, but Trump added to the uncertainty late Wednesday when he suggested the United States could send letters to other countries at some point \u201csaying this is the deal. You can take it or you can leave it.\u201d",
      "In currency trading early Friday, the U.S. dollar gained to 143.70 Japanese yen from 143.46 yen. The euro edged lower, to $1.1537 from $1.1590.",

      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams.

It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",

The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",

      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",

      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",

      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",

The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to.

      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry spokesman said on Thursday",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The high-level negotiations over China's export controls of rare earths is giving U.S. businesses some relief, even though it may be only for now.",
      "China has approved \u201ca certain number\u201d of export permits for rare earth elements and related items, its commerce ministry said on Thursday, one day after U.S. President Donald Trump declared that Beijing would supply to the U.S. companies those key elements and the magnets made from them following a two-day trade talk in London.",
      "\u201cI will be one of the happiest people out there if, if in fact, China starts to, to release some of those heavy rare earths and allows them to get into the world economy because the world economy is going to shut down without those heavy rare earths,\u201d said Mark Smith, chief executive officer of NioCorp., which is developing a new mine in Nebraska to produce niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths.",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington, after China imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to halt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Negotiators from the two governments said they reached a framework to move forward, with details yet to be agreed to by Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but businesses welcomed the developments, even though uncertainties persist.",
      "Rare earth elements are some of the most sought-after critical minerals. Despite the name, they aren't actually rare, but it is hard to find them in high enough concentrations to make mining them economical. They are also difficult to extract from the ore, and China over the past several decades has built dominance in the processing capacity, supplying nearly 90% of the world's rare earths.",
      "In the heat of the tariff war with Trump, Beijing on April 4 announced permitting requirements for seven heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "The elements China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium, are key ingredients needed to make permanent rare earth magnets withstand high temperatures. That is crucial for a variety of uses in electric vehicles, wind turbines and military uses like jet engines and nuclear submarines.",
      "Some of the other rare earths needed for those magnets are produced at the only operating U.S. rare earths mine run by MP Materials in California, but China remains the only source of nearly all of what\u2019s known as the heavy rare earths. MP Materials previously sent the heavy rare earths that it mines to China for processing but it halted that in April amid the tariffs. The company is working to expand its own processing capability as soon as possible, and it is building a new magnet plant in Texas.",
      "Neha Mukherjee, rare earths analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, had previously predicted that most companies wouldn\u2019t start to run short of rare earths until later this year, but it appears some companies already have problems.",
      "\u201cThe overall market stockpile exists, but looks like a lot of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), especially auto manufacturers, were not prepared, especially in Europe,\u201d Mukherjee said. Some American companies have stockpiled, but they \u201cmight start experiencing constraint if this continues.\u201d",
      "\u201cLooks like most of the stockpile is still in China hence the bottleneck in supply,\u201d Mukherjee said.",
      "On June 4, the European Association of Automotive Supplies said the industry was \u201calready experiencing significant disruption\u201d due to China\u2019s export restrictions on rare earths and magnets. \u201cThese restrictions have led to the shutdown of several production lines and plants across Europe, with further impacts expected in the coming weeks as inventories deplete,\u201d the group said.",
      "Details are still scarce on any agreement on rare earths shipments from China.",
      "On Thursday, He Yadong, spokesman for the Chinese commerce ministry, said China will \u201csufficiently consider the reasonable needs and concerns by all countries in the civilian field\" in reviewing applications of export permits for rare earths and related items.",
      "He said that it is consistent with international practice to put export controls on rare earths because they can be used for both civilian and military purposes.",
      "In a note, Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, wrote that even though there is an agreement for now, \u201csupply cutoffs will remain an ever-present threat.\u201d That's because China\u2019s licensing regime for the export of the seven heavy rare earths and related magnets is permanent, despite perceptions at the time that it was an act of retaliation, he wrote.",
      "China \"will probably not approve exports in sufficient quantity to allow U.S. customers to stockpile, ensuring that Beijing\u2019s leverage remains undiminished,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBeijing may approve few if any exports to U.S. defense companies and their suppliers.\u201d",
      "Smith of NioCorp. said even if the Chinese are offering a reprieve from their restrictions on rare earths, they will likely still keep limits in place on U.S. military uses.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m in the military and flying a jet or running a nuclear class submarine or a guided missile, I don\u2019t want that to fail because of high temperatures. So we have to have these heavy rare earths,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith said he hopes to find a solution to the problem of America being almost entirely dependent on China for these elements.",
      "\u201cI sincerely hope from the bottom of my heart that we use this situation as our final learning,\" Smith said. \u201cLet\u2019s take care of what we know needs to be taken care of.\u201d",

      "The Republican tax bill approved by the House would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican tax bill approved by the U.S. House of Representatives would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Middle-income households would see a boost of roughly $500 to $1,000 per year under Republican President Donald Trump's tax bill, the CBO found.",
      "The cuts to the lowest-income households come from proposed cuts to social safety net programs including Medicaid and a food assistance program for lower-income people, known as Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program.",
      "The bill also proposes expanding work requirements to receive food aid and new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents to receive Medicaid. Some proposed tax breaks would be temporary, including a tax break on tips and overtime, car loan interest and a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO's analyses of the bill and say that the U.S. could head toward economic catastrophe if the measure is not passed. GOP Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that the tax bill \"recognizes the solution to our debt crisis is not to tax Americans more, it is to spend less.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe legislation recognizes that extending proven tax reform is critical for working families,\" he said.",
      "Administration officials have said the the cost of the tax bill would be offset by tariff income. Recently, the CBO separately estimated that Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall.",
      "The CBO was established more than 50 years ago to provide objective, impartial analysis to support the budget process. It is required to produce a cost estimate for nearly every bill approved by a House or Senate committee and will weigh in earlier when asked to do so by lawmakers.",
      "The office's analysis released Thursday considers Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d in isolation, excluding the potential impact of the tariffs that Trump has imposed and paused on nations around the world.",
      "Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who requested the CBO analysis released Thursday, said in a statement that \"this would be one of the largest transfers of wealth from working families to the ultra-rich in American history. It\u2019s shameful.\u201d",

      "The Air India plane crash that killed at least 240 people is just the latest aviation disaster this year",
      "At least 240 people were killed when an Air India plane crashed Thursday into a medical school shortly after takeoff. It was the latest in a long list of aviation disasters this year.",
      "One passenger survived the crash but everyone else aboard the Boeing 787 was killed. More people died on the ground after the plane crashed and generated a large fireball. Black smoke billowed from the site where the plane crashed and burst into flames near the airport in Ahmedabad, a city of more than 5 million and the capital of Gujarat.",
      "All the aircraft crashes and near misses have fueled many worries about flying.",
      "The Indian crash was far worse than the midair collision that killed 67 people near Washington, D.C., in January in the first major fatal crash on U.S. soil since 2009. Other recent incidents include an airliner clipping another in February while taxiing at the Seattle airport. In March, an American Airlines plane caught fire after landing in Denver, sending 12 people to the hospital. A sightseeing helicopter broke apart and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey in April, killing six people.",
      "Federal officials have tried to reassure travelers that flying is the safest mode of transportation, and statistics support that. But the cascade of headlines about all the things that have gone wrong is drawing increasing attention.",
      "Here is a look at some of the recent tragedies and mishaps:",
      "\u2014 Two different small planes crashed near San Diego over the past month. Six people died when a private jet crashed into a San Diego neighborhood in the midst of heavy fog. The runway lights weren't working at that airport. Six more people died earlier this week when a small plane crashed into the ocean shortly after taking off in San Diego.",
      "\u2014 The New York helicopter that crashed on April 10 departed a downtown heliport. The flight lasted less than 18 minutes. Radar data shows the helicopter flew north along the Manhattan skyline, then south toward the Statue of Liberty. The victims in this crash included a family from Spain who was celebrating the ninth birthday of one of their children.",
      "\u2014 Three people were killed and one was injured when a small plane crashed April 11 in Boca Raton, Florida, near a major interstate highway and pushed a car onto railroad tracks.",
      "\u2014 Two small planes collided midair near an Arizona airport in February, killing two people who were on one of the aircraft. Following the collision, one plane landed uneventfully, but the other hit the ground near a runway and caught fire. The crash happened at Marana Regional Airport near Tucson.",
      "\u2014 A small commuter plane crashed in Alaska in early February, killing all 10 people on board. The crash was one of the deadliest in the state in 25 years. Radar data indicated that the plane rapidly lost elevation and speed. The U.S. Coast Guard was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft.",
      "\u2014 A medical transport plane that had just taken off plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in late January, killing all six people on board and two people on the ground. About two dozen people were also hurt. The National Transportation Safety Board said its cockpit voice recorder likely hadn't been functioning for years. The crew made no distress calls to air traffic control.",
      "\u2014 The collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and a U.S. Army helicopter above the nation's capital killed everyone aboard both aircraft in late January. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground.",
      "\u2014 A jetliner operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames in late December in South Korea after its landing gear apparently failed to deploy. All but two of the 181 people aboard were killed in one of that country\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "\u2014 The American Airlines plane that caught fire at Denver International Airport in March had been diverted there because the crew reported engine vibrations after taking off in Colorado Springs. While taxiing to the gate, an engine caught fire, prompting slides to be deployed so passengers could evacuate quickly. The people taken to hospitals had minor injuries. The NTSB found a fuel leak and several improperly installed parts in the engine.",
      "\u2014 A single-engine plane carrying five people crashed and burst into flames that same month in the parking lot of a retirement community near a small airport near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Everyone on board survived. Three people were taken to an area burn center.",
      "\u2014 A Delta Air Lines jet flipped over while landing at Toronto\u2019s Pearson Airport in February. All 80 people on board survived, but some people received minor injuries. Witnesses and video from the scene showed the plane landing so hard that its right wing was sheared off. Investigators said when trying to determine the cause, they would consider the weather conditions and the possibility of human error.",
      "\u2014 Last month, two commercial planes had to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport near Washington because of an Army Black Hawk helicopter flying near the Pentagon. The Army suspended all its helicopter flights in the area after this incident. It was a Black Hawk priority air transport from the same unit known as the PAT25 that collided with the passenger jet in midair in January.",
      "\u2014 In April, on the same day as the fatal New York helicopter crash, a wing tip of an American Airlines plane struck another plane from the same airline on a taxiway of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. There were no reported injuries. Multiple members of Congress were aboard one of the flights.",
      "\u2014 A FedEx cargo plane made an emergency landing at a busy New Jersey airport in March after a bird strike caused an engine fire that could be seen in the morning sky. The plane landed at Newark Liberty International Airport. There were no reported injuries.",
      "\u2014 Pilots on a Southwest Airlines flight about to land at Chicago\u2019s Midway Airport were forced to climb back into the sky to avoid another aircraft crossing the runway in late February. Video showed the plane approaching the runway before it abruptly pulled up as a business jet taxied onto the runway without authorization, federal officials said.",
      "\u2014 In early February, a Japan Airlines plane was taxiing on the tarmac of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when it apparently clipped the tail of a parked Delta plane. There were no injuries reported.",
      "\u2014 In early January, passengers panicked when a man aboard a JetBlue plane taxiing for takeoff from Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, triggering an emergency slide to inflate. Other passengers quickly restrained the man and the plane didn't take off.",

      "GREENSBORO, N.C. -- GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) \u2014 JetZero Inc. announced plans Thursday to build its first manufacturing plant for a next-generation passenger jet in central North Carolina, a project that if successful would create more than 14,500 jobs there in a decade.",
      "The California-based startup intends to build the factory at Greensboro\u2019s airport, investing $4.7 billion. The planned hirings from 2027 through 2036 would be the largest job commitment in North Carolina history, according to Gov. Josh Stein.",
      "The company previously identified Greensboro as one of three finalists for the factory to build its fixed-wing \u2014 also known as all-wing or blended-wing \u2014 Z4 aircraft, which JetZero says will be 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional tube-and-wing airliners.",
      "JetZero has said it's already received about $300 million in investment in the Z4 project, including a U.S. Air Force grant to build and fly a demonstrator model by 2027.",
      "United Airlines and Alaska Airlines also are project investors and have made conditional purchase agreements for their fleets, the company said. JetZero aims for the planes to go into service in the early 2030s, with a goal of completing 20 airplanes per month at full production.",
      "Stein, on hand with JetZero executives and other officials for the formal announcement at Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, cited North Carolina's robust aerospace industry and the first manned powered flights at Kitty Hawk by the Wright brothers in 1903.",
      "\u201cNorth Carolina is the perfect location,\u201d Stein said. \u201cNorth Carolina was first in flight. We are also the future of flight.\u201d",
      "The jobs would pay minimum average salaries of more than $89,000, according to the state Department of Commerce, which provided details of the project earlier Thursday to a state committee that awards economic incentives.",
      "State and local monetary and training incentives for JetZero and the project described at the committee meeting could exceed $2.3 billion by the 2060s if investment and job-creation thresholds and other requirements are met.",
      "A portion of state incentives awarded by the committee \u2014 more than $1 billion over 37 years \u2014 is based on a percentage of income taxes withheld from plant workers\u2019 paychecks. The incentives also include up to $784 million from Guilford County and Greensboro and $450 million from the General Assembly to help with infrastructure, officials said. The project includes a research facility for composite structures.",
      "A commerce department official said that JetZero, headquartered in Long Beach, California, looked for over a year for a plant location, examining 25 sites in 17 states.",
      "JetZero, currently with just 225 workers, enters a jet purchasing market dominated by industry behemoths U.S.-based Boeing and European Airbus.",
      "\u201cWe have already shown strong commercial interest and momentum to meet the real airline demand for this aircraft,\u201d CEO Tom O'Leary said. \u201cSo this is more than just a factory. It\u2019s a launchpad for a new chapter of American aerospace.\u201d",
      "While a variant of the Z4 would have tanker and transport uses in the military, JetZero has said that it would focus first on building a commercial jetliner with about 250 seats and a range of 5,000 nautical miles.",
      "The 5-year-old company says the plane\u2019s shape will reduce drag and the mounting of engines on the top and back of the plane will make it much quieter than traditional airliners. The Z4 would run on conventional jet fuel but could be converted to hydrogen fuel, according to JetZero.",
      "JetZero says Z4 travelers will board through larger doors and into shorter but wider cabins, and aisles will be less congested as bathrooms will be far away from galleys where meals are prepared.",
      "\u201cIt's going to deliver a better passenger experience than you\u2019ve ever had before on any other plane,\u201d O'Leary said.",
      "The state is already home to more than 400 aerospace companies. And the Piedmont Triad airport has emerged as an industry hot spot, with Honda Aircraft placing its headquarters there and Boom Supersonic building its first full-scale manufacturing plant for next-generation supersonic passenger jets.",
      "The central location and easy access to interstates also lured Toyota to build an electric battery plant in adjoining Randolph County.",
      "North Carolina's previous largest economic development project, measured by employment, was revealed in 2022, when Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced plans to build an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Chatham County, promising 7,500 jobs.",

      "Former congressman Billy Long of Missouri has been confirmed to lead the Internal Revenue Service, an agency he once sought to abolish",
      "WASHINGTON -- Former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri was confirmed on Thursday to lead the Internal Revenue Service, giving the beleaguered agency he once sought to abolish a permanent commissioner after months of acting leaders and massive staffing cuts that have threatened to derail next year\u2019s tax filing season.",
      "The Senate confirmed Long despite Democrats\u2019 concerns about the Republican's past work for a firm that pitched a fraud-ridden coronavirus pandemic-era tax break and about campaign contributions he received after President Donald Trump nominated him to serve as IRS commissioner.",
      "While in Congress, where he served from 2011 to 2023, Long sponsored legislation to get rid of the IRS, the agency he is now tasked with leading. A former auctioneer, Long has no background in tax administration.",
      "Long will take over an IRS undergoing massive change, including layoffs and voluntary retirements of tens of thousands of workers and accusations that then-Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency mishandled sensitive taxpayer data. Unions and advocacy organizations have sued to block DOGE\u2019s access to the information.",
      "The IRS was one of the highest-profile agencies still without a Senate-confirmed leader. Before Long\u2019s confirmation, the IRS shuffled through four acting leaders, including one who resigned over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and another whose appointment led to a fight between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "After leaving Congress to mount an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, Long worked with a firm that distributed the pandemic-era employee retention tax credit. That tax credit program was eventually shut down after then-IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel determined that it was fraudulent.",
      "Democrats called for a criminal investigation into Long\u2019s connections to other alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits.",
      "Long appeared before the Senate Finance Committee last month and denied any wrongdoing related to his involvement in the tax credit scheme.",
      "Ahead of the confirmation vote, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles blasting the requisite FBI background check conducted on Long as a political appointee as inadequate.",
      "\u201cThese issues were not adequately investigated,\u201d Wyden wrote. \u201cIn fact, the FBI\u2019s investigation, a process dictated by the White House, seemed designed to avoid substantively addressing any of these concerning public reports. It\u2019s almost as if the FBI is unable to read the newspaper.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers have also written to Long and his associated firms detailing concerns with what they call unusually timed contributions made to Long\u2019s defunct 2022 Senate campaign committee shortly after Trump nominated him.",
      "The IRS faces an uncertain future under Long. Tax experts have voiced concerns that the 2026 filing season could be hampered by the departure of so many tax collection workers. In April, The Associated Press reported that the IRS planned to cut as many as 20,000 staffers \u2014 up to 25% of the workforce. An IRS representative on Thursday confirmed the IRS had shed about that many workers but said the cuts amounted to approximately the same number of IRS jobs added under the Biden administration.",
      "The fate of the Direct File program, the free electronic tax return filing system developed during President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, is also unclear. Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies had complained it was a waste of taxpayer money because free filing programs already exist, although they are hard to use. Long said during his confirmation hearing that it would be one of the first programs that come up for discussion if he were confirmed.",
      "Long is not the only Trump appointee to support dismantling an agency he was assigned to manage.",
      "Linda McMahon, the current education secretary, has repeatedly said she is trying to put herself out of a job by closing the federal department and transferring its work to the states. Rick Perry, Trump's energy secretary during his first term, called for abolishing the Energy Department during his bid for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a resolution on Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The state quickly announced it was challenging the move in court, with California's attorney general holding a news conference to discuss the lawsuit before Trump's signing ceremony ended at the White House.",
      "The resolution was approved by Congress last month and aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. Trump also signed measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Trump called California\u2019s regulations \u201ccrazy\u201d at a White House ceremony where he signed the resolutions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster for this country,\u201d he said.",
      "It comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over issues including tariffs, the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "The state is already involved in more than two-dozen lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions, and the state's Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the latest one at a news conference in California. Ten other states, all with Democratic attorneys general, joined the lawsuit filed Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s actions are not only unlawful; they\u2019re irrational and wildly partisan,\u201d Bonta said. \u201cThey come at the direct expense of the health and the well-being of our people.\u201d",
      "The three resolutions Trump signed will block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and end the sale of new ones by 2035. They will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "In his remarks at the White House, Trump expressed doubts about the performance and reliability of electric vehicles, though he had some notably positive comments about the company owned by Elon Musk, despite their fractured relationship.",
      "\u201cI like Tesla,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In remarks that often meandered away from the subject at hand, Trump used the East Room ceremony to also muse on windmills, which he claimed \u201care killing our country,\u201d the prospect of getting electrocuted by an electric-powered boat if it sank and whether he'd risk a shark attack by jumping as the boat went down.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take electrocution every single day,\" the president said.",
      "When it comes to cars, Trump said he likes combustion engines but for those that prefer otherwise, \u201cIf you want to buy electric, you can buy electric.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat this does is it gives us freedom,\u201d said Bill Kent, the owner of Kent Kwik convenience stores. Kent, speaking at the White House, said that the California rules would have forced him to install \u201cinfrastructure that frankly, is extremely expensive and doesn\u2019t give you any return.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major car makers, applauded Trump\u2019s action.",
      "\u201cEveryone agreed these EV sales mandates were never achievable and wildly unrealistic,\u201d John Bozzella, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Newsom said Trump\u2019s action was a continuation of his \u201call-out assault\u201d on California.",
      "\u201cAnd this time he\u2019s destroying our clean air and America\u2019s global competitiveness in the process,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters.\u201d",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move follows other steps the Trump administration has taken to roll back rules that aim to protect air and water and reduce emissions that cause climate change.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.",
      "Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, said the signing of the resolutions was \u201cTrump\u2019s latest betrayal of democracy.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The first thing Alison Jones does when she wakes up is to name three things she\u2019s grateful for. It can be as simple as the breeze from a fan or as meaningful as the way a friend showed up for her emotionally.",
      "Jones, an organizational development consultant, said the daily practice has helped her through hardships and the anxiety and vulnerability of starting her own business as a single mom.",
      "\u201cWhen you practice gratitude, you train your brain to always look for the positive in anything. It just completely shifts everything you\u2019re going through,\u201d she said. \u201cYou start to see the lessons in the pain. You start see the beauty in the very difficult times because you realize, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m growing stronger.\u2019\u201d",
      "Practicing and encouraging gratitude can be a simple way to boost morale at a time when layoffs and economic uncertainty are causing stress and anxiety. Some employers have found that workers who receive expressions of gratitude show more engagement and willingness to help others.",
      "Other proponents say expressing and receiving appreciation can help reduce stress, as well as improve a person's mood and outlook.",
      "But despite its benefits, promoting gratefulness is often overlooked as a valuable way to spend time and resources in the workplace.",
      "Experts in organizational change shared ways to incorporate more gratitude into the workday.",
      "If you\u2019re new to practicing gratitude, you can start at home with a routine such as Jones\u2019 custom of expressing gratitude before getting out of bed.",
      "She made her gratitude practice easy so it would become a sustainable habit. Her one rule is avoiding repetition and stretching her mind to find new things to be grateful for each day.",
      "Jones also recommends finding a \u201cgratitude buddy\u201d to share with. A buddy may be a friend from work or your social circles, and ideas can be exchanged in person, by text or email, or during a phone call. Many people find it helpful to list what they\u2019re grateful for in a journal.",
      "At work, a team leader can begin a staff meeting by expressing gratitude for what went well in the last week, suggested Peter Bonanno, a consultant who helps companies design mindfulness-based programs.",
      "As humans, we often have a bias toward negativity, but gratitude \u201cjust does an enormous amount to shift people\u2019s mindsets and the way they engage with each other,\u201d he said. \u201cGratitude is especially powerful in that way. It doesn\u2019t take a long time for people to notice an impact.\u201d",
      "O.C. Tanner Institute, a software and service company, helps organizations find effective ways to show appreciation to their employees, such as managers giving handwritten notes of thanks. The company helped American Airlines develop a system for managers and colleagues to recognize good work with points that can be applied to a catalog order.",
      "It also helped Amway create gift boxes to celebrate workers' accomplishments and important personal milestones, such as buying a home or adopting a child.",
      "\u201cRecognition impacts so many facets of the employee experience. And when you do it well, it connects people back to a deep sense of purpose and meaning,\u201d said Meghan Stettler, a director at O.C. Tanner.",
      "Some companies donate their own products to thank nurses, doctors, police officers, firefighters and other workers who serve their communities. Frontline Builders, a nonprofit organization launched during the pandemic, connects donors of snacks, drinks and personal care items with recipients.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all worked in that job where we weren\u2019t shown gratitude and realized how much that stinks,\u201d said Jason Lalack, partnership director at Frontline Builders. \u201cShowing someone gratitude or showing appreciation doesn\u2019t really cost anything, and shouldn\u2019t be that difficult of a thing, and yet it\u2019s rarer than it should be.\u201d",
      "Registered nurse Denise Whittsell remembers how quiet the hospital where she works became during the pandemic. The hallways of Denver Health, typically busy with families and guests, were suddenly empty as visits from outsiders were curtailed and patients battled illnesses alone.",
      "Once in a while, someone from the community would deliver gifts of gratitude: tasty snacks or handmade cards from schoolchildren.",
      "\u201cThose spontaneous recognitions were really sweet,\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt just felt really kind, and it felt like there was a lot of wrapping around us, a very supportive feeling.\u201d",
      "Whittsell is part of a team of volunteers at Denver Health's RESTORE program, which connects front-line hospital workers with trained peer responders for confidential emotional support and training.",
      "The hospital started the program as a way to improve and sustain the emotional well-being of its workforce, said Tia Henry, the program's director. Volunteers take shifts so someone is available around-the-clock to answer calls from hospital personnel who are struggling with stressful events such as losing a patient or witnessing violence.",
      "Volunteers and staff regularly express gratitude for the program, Henry said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had calls on my way to work: \u2018I\u2019m having a hard time and I need to talk with somebody who gets it,\u2019\u201d Whittsell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to give back to the people that I work with.\"",
      "Aside from peer support, RESTORE also provides training and education to employees about stress, burnout and techniques to deescalate violence, Henry said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not doing counseling or therapy, but we\u2019re using components of psychological first aid to truly engage timely with our teammates when they\u2019re distressed, helping them calm their nervous system and get back to the place of regulation where they can show back up and do what it is they need to do or they can lay something down and go back home,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat is gratitude from my lens.\u201d",
      "Indy Public Safety Foundation, an Indianapolis nonprofit organization that supports front-line workers, shows gratitude to police, firefighters and paramedics through awards banquets, trainings, and showing up with food, shaking hands and saying thank you after a community tragedy.",
      "Foundation staff members take gratitude a step further by providing tools and equipment such as electric bikes for police patrols.",
      "While front-line workers were applauded during the pandemic, \"their work has continued and arguably not gotten any less stressful, and some of that support has waned,\u201d said Dane Nutty, the foundation's president and CEO.",
      "While practicing gratitude may make for a more pleasant on-the-job environment, it's not a replacement for better working conditions. It's good to be grateful to have a job that pays the bills. It's also important to ask for what's fair.",
      "\u201cBeing grateful absolutely doesn\u2019t mean that we accept anything subpar or inappropriate,\u201d Jones said, adding that people should advocate for basic needs such as meal breaks. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to confuse gratitude with being passive.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Toy robots that teach children to code. Sneakers made in America. Mold-resistant kitchen gadgets.",
      "The three items are among new products that have gotten stuck in the pipeline due to President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies, according to the brand founders behind the stalled items. They say that instead of fostering U.S. innovation, Trump\u2019s tariffs are stifling it with extra costs and unexpected work.",
      "At Learning Resources in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Made Plus in Annapolis, Maryland, and Dorai Home in Salt Lake City, research and development have taken a backseat to recalculating budgets, negotiating with vendors and tracking shipments in the shifting tariff environment.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t have enough cash to cover just the restocks of the things that we know we need, do we want to take a risk on this new thing when we don\u2019t know how well it will sell yet?\u201d Dorai Home founder Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "O\u2019Callaghan started the eco-friendly home goods company with a stone bath mat and now offers about 50 kitchen and bathroom accessories, which are made in China with a non-toxic material that dries quickly. New launches are critical to increasing sales and attracting customers, she said.",
      "As Trump increased the tariff on Chinese goods to 20% and as high as 145% before reducing the import tax rate to 30% for 90 days, Dorai Home postponed introducing new merchandise. O'Callaghan said she had to lay off the CEO as well as the head of product development, who helped the company jump on new trends.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t really put the time or the emphasis on (innovation) because I\u2019m covering too many other people\u2019s roles,\u201d she said.",
      "The company paused shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis after the president's rate reduction. On Wednesday, Trump touted progress  in U.S.-China trade talks.",
      "With details still sketchy and a deal not finalized, entrepreneurs interviewed by The Associated Press said they viewed the tariffs war as an ongoing threat.",
      "The potential stunting of innovation follows an economic slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic, when companies also had to put projects on hold. Some experts think the on-again-off again tariffs may have more enduring consequences because they rewire markets and upend business strategies.",
      "\u201cWhen executive attention shifts from innovation to regulatory compliance, the innovation pipeline suffers. Companies end up optimizing for the political landscape rather than technological advancement,\u201d economists J. Bradford Jensen, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and Scott J. Wallsten, president of the Technology Policy Institute think tank, wrote in an April blog post.",
      "Trump has argued that curtailing foreign imports with tariffs would help revive the nation's diminished manufacturing base. Analysts and various trade groups have warned that fractured trade ties and supply chains may depress R&D activity of U.S. tech and health care companies that rely on international partnerships or foreign suppliers.",
      "Small companies, which often drive the innovations that create jobs and economic growth, already are under strain.",
      "With fewer people on staff and tighter budgets compared to large corporations, entrepreneurs say they are spending more time on cutting costs, suspending or arranging orders, and deciding how much of their tariff-related costs to charge customers. That means they\u2019re spending less time thinking of their next big ideas.",
      "Schylling Inc., a Massachusetts company that produces modern versions of Lava lamps, Sea-Monkeys, My Little Pony and other nostalgic toys, has its products made in China. As part of its strategy to account for tariffs, the company put a group of employees on temporary unpaid leave last month to reduce expenses.",
      "Marketing director Beth Muehlenkamp said she and other furloughed workers typically would have been planning products for the final months of 2026. But Schylling isn't focusing on designing new products given the unstable trade outlook.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to focus on innovation and creativity when you\u2019re consumed with this day-to-day of how we\u2019re just going to balance the books and deal with the changing rates,\u201d Muehlenkamp said.",
      "Even some companies that do their manufacturing in the U.S. are scaling back investments in new products. Made Plus, a Maryland company that makes athletic shoes at a small factory in the state capital, put a planned golf line on hold because two key components \u2014 a foam insole and the tread for the bottom of the shoe \u2014 currently are made in China, founder Alan Guyan said.",
      "The company customizes its shoes on demand and charges $145 to $200 a pair. The footwear is made from recycled plastic bottles with advanced knitting, 3D printing and computerized stitching techniques. It's looking into getting components from Vietnam instead of China.",
      "Embracing new technology is essential to restoring manufacturing capability in the U.S. and competing with Asia, Guyan said. But given ongoing trade frictions, he said he does not want to invest time or money evaluating the latest embroidery and knitting machines, which come from Germany, Italy, China and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just battening down the hatches a little bit and just hoping that there\u2019s enough influence in the community of footwear that it will somewhat change and get resolved and we can move forward,\u201d he said of the tariff roller coaster.",
      "In contrast, many big companies are forging on. Google parent Alphabet confirmed late last month that it still planned to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures this year, with most of the money going toward artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Sonia Lapinsky, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners, has advised her clients to limit tariff discussions to a small group of executives and to keep their product creation cycles in motion.",
      "Businesses have an even greater imperative to come up with attention-grabbing innovations when consumers may be reluctant to open their wallets, she said.",
      "Yet smaller companies may struggle to wall off tariff discussions from the rest of the business.",
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg said that roughly 25% to 30% of the 350 employees at the educational toy company\u2019s headquarters, including product developers, are working at least part-time on tariff-related tasks.",
      "The company usually develops 250 different products a year and expects to get half that many off the drawing board for 2026, Woldenberg said. While exploring factories in countries besides China, he said, Learning Resources is delaying the next generation of its interactive robots that help children develop computer programming skills through games and other activities.",
      "The family-run business and Woldenberg's other toy business, hand2Mind, are locked in a legal battle with the Trump administration. The jointly owned companies filed a lawsuit accusing the president of exceeding his authority by invoking an emergency powers law to impose tariffs.",
      "A federal judge ruled in favor of the two companies last month, and the administration has appealed the decision. Woldenberg said he's ready to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt's a win at the Supreme Court that we need,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so until then, there will be no certainty. Even then, if the government is bound and determined to keep us in an uncertain situation, they\u2019ll be able to do that.\u201d",

      "GANZHOU, China -- China\u2019s dominance over critical minerals in global supply chains was a powerful bargaining chip in trade talks between Beijing and Washington that concluded with both sides saying they have a framework to pursue a deal.",
      "China has spent decades building the world's main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care.",
      "Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China's control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them.",
      "Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries.",
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a \u201ccertain number\u201d of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump\u2019s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia.",
      "Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources.",
      "The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. first fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government\u2019s earlier stance.",
      "\u201cWithout that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.\u201d",
      "In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China's ascent as the world's biggest manufacturing power, famously said \u201cthe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,\u201d signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals.",
      "Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth\u2019s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China's economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a \u201cvital strategic resource.\u201d",
      "China today has an essential monopoly over \u201cheavy rare earths,\u201d used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles.",
      "The country also produces around 80% of the world\u2019s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world\u2019s germanium -\u2013 all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies.",
      "The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials.",
      "Beijing's across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers.",
      "Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company\u2019s work on humanoid robots.",
      "In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains' once-abundant resources.",
      "Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he's unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry.",
      "\u201cI find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,\u201d he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors.",
      "At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.",
      "Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong\u2019s plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia.",
      "Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand.",
      "Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank.",
      "Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China.",
      "Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say.",
      "The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine's owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed.",
      "Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It's seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths.",
      "The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China's could take decades.",
      "\u201cThere are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we're developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,\u201d Smith said.",
      "The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered \u201cniche\u201d because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cFor many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.\u201d",

      "The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by Tuesday's raid carried out by federal immigration officials",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by federal immigration officials, who raided the plant and arrested more than half its workforce.",
      "The raid took place despite the company meticulously following the government's own system for verifying the workers were in the country legally, owner Gary Rohwer said Wednesday.",
      "Glenn Valley Foods now is operating at about 30% of capacity as the business scrambles to hire more workers, Rohwer said as he stood outside the plant.",
      "Asked how upsetting the raid was, Rohwer replied, \u201cI was very upset, ma\u2019am, because we were told to e-verify, and we e-verified all these years, so I was shocked.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did everything we could possibly do,\" he said.",
      "E-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.",
      "Some of America\u2019s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.",
      "Rohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cflawed\u201d to Glenn Valley executives.",
      "But that does nothing to repair the company\u2019s bottom line, Rohwer said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.",
      "The Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.",
      "The raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.",
      "The Metropolitan Community College\u2019s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.\u201d",
      "That fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.",
      "\u201cYou know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,\u201d he said.",
      "An aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.",
      "The raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, \u201cMy message to the public is that we are with them.\u201d",
      "Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.",
      "\u201cThat is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,\u201d the chief said. \u201cI need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they\u2019re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is expected to sign a measure Thursday that blocks California\u2019s first-in-the-nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, a White House official told The Associated Press.",
      "The resolution Trump plans to sign, which Congress approved last month, aims to quash the country\u2019s most aggressive attempt to phase out gas-powered cars. He also plans to approve measures to overturn state policies curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "The timing of the signing was confirmed Wednesday by a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to share plans not yet public.",
      "The development comes as the Republican president is mired in a clash with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, over Trump's move to deploy troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. It's the latest in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and heavily Democratic California over everything from tariffs to the rights of LGBTQ+ youth and funding for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a day ending in Y, it\u2019s another day of Trump\u2019s war on California,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villase\u00f1or said in an email. \"We\u2019re fighting back.\"",
      "According to the White House official, Trump is expected to sign resolutions that block California\u2019s rule phasing out gas-powered cars and ending the sale of new ones by 2035. He will also kill rules that phase out the sale of medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles and cut tailpipe emissions from trucks.",
      "The president is scheduled to sign the measures and make remarks during an event at the White House on Thursday morning.",
      "Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, and California officials contend that what the federal government is doing is illegal and said the state plans to sue.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin are expected to attend, along with members of Congress and representatives from the energy, trucking and gas station industries.",
      "The signings come as Trump has pledged to revive American auto manufacturing and boost oil and gas drilling.",
      "The move will also come a day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed repealing rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas. Zeldin said it would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help \u201cunleash\u201d American energy.",
      "California, which has some of the nation\u2019s worst air pollution, has been able to seek waivers for decades from the EPA, allowing it to adopt stricter emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "In his first term, Trump revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its standards, but President Joe Biden reinstated it in 2022. Trump has not yet sought to revoke it again.",
      "Republicans have long criticized those waivers and earlier this year opted to use the Congressional Review Act, a law aimed at improving congressional oversight of actions by federal agencies, to try to block the rules.",
      "That\u2019s despite a finding from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog, that California\u2019s standards cannot legally be blocked using the Congressional Review Act. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that finding.",
      "California, which makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, has significant power to sway trends in the auto industry. About a dozen states signed on to adopt California's rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars.",
      "The National Automobile Dealers Association supported the federal government\u2019s move to block California\u2019s ban on gas-powered cars, saying Congress should decide on such a national issue, not the state.",
      "The American Trucking Associations said the rules were not feasible and celebrated Congress\u2019 move to block them.",
      "Chris Spear, the CEO of the American Trucking Associations, said in a statement Wednesday: \u201cThis is not the United States of California.\u201d",
      "It was also applauded by Detroit automaker General Motors, which said it will \u201chelp align emissions standards with today\u2019s market realities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have long advocated for one national standard that will allow us to stay competitive, continue to invest in U.S. innovation, and offer customer choice across the broadest lineup of gas-powered and electric vehicles,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "Dan Becker with the Center for Biological Diversity, in anticipation of the president signing the measures, said earlier Thursday that the move would be \u201cTrump\u2019s latest betrayal of democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cSigning this bill is a flagrant abuse of the law to reward Big Oil and Big Auto corporations at the expense of everyday people\u2019s health and their wallets,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",

Civale, who is 40-37 with a 4.06 ERA in 122 career big league starts, is making $8 million this year and is eligible for free agency at the end of the season.",

      "This is becoming Leon Draisaitl's Stanley Cup Final for the Edmonton Oilers",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- This is becoming Leon Draisaitl\u2019s Stanley Cup Final for the Edmonton Oilers.",
      "The standout German forward has scored the overtime goal in each of their two wins in the championship series rematch against the Florida Panthers, including Thursday night in Game 4 to pull Edmonton even. He\u2019s just the fifth player in NHL history and first in more than three decades to score twice in overtime in the final.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s as clutch as it gets,\" goaltender Calvin Pickard said while sitting next to Draisaitl, who also had a pair of assists for a three-point performance. \u201cAlways scores big goals at big times.\u201d",
      "Draisaitl\u2019s four OT goals this playoffs are the most in a single postseason. John LeClair was the last to score two OT goals in a final for Montreal back in 1993, the last time a Canadian team won the Cup.",
      "Edmonton is two victories away from ending that drought thanks in large part to Draisaitl delivering when it matters most.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\" longtime teammate Ryan Nugent-Hopkins said. \"He\u2019s a horse out there for us \u2014 just always. It\u2019s just constant. It\u2019s consistent. We always can lean on him, and he always finds a way to get those big ones.\u201d",
      "It's also nothing new. Among modern day players with at least 40 games of playoff experience, only Hall of Famers Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and teammate Connor McDavid have produced at a higher rate at the toughest time of the year to put the puck in the net.",
      "Draisaitl is averaging 1.49 points a game, and this series has been a showcase for him after being far less than 100% a year ago when he and the Oilers lost in the final. All the overtimes aren't bothering him.",
      "\u201cI feel great,\" Draisaitl said. \"It\u2019s a long season, of course, for either side. We\u2019ve played the same amount of minutes in this series. Fatigue kicks in at some point, but your adrenaline usually takes over and you just chip away at it, chip away at it.\u201d",
      "Draisaitl addressed teammates after a 6-1 loss in Game 3 on Monday night, an uncharacteristic effort from the oldest team in the league. He was equally as unpleased after Edmonton fell behind 3-0 in the first period of Game 4.",
      "\"We were kind of lollygagging around a little bit,\" Draisaitl said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly not the time to lollygag around, especially after getting spanked in Game 3.\u201d",
      "The Oilers rallied to tie it, took the lead and then gave up the tying goal with 19.5 seconds left in regulation. That set the stage for Draisaitl to lead the way with his play, not just his words.",
      "\u201cHe not only says what he\u2019s going to do, he backs it up with his play and his actions,\u201d defenseman Darnell Nurse said. \"That\u2019s what makes him an amazing leader. We get into overtime, those tense moments and he has an ability to relax in them and just make plays. He gets rewarded for working hard.\u201d",
      "Draisaitl accurately called his goal \u201ca fortunate bounce \u2014 no secret about it.\u201d But there were enough plays throughout the night that he did not finish, so call it even.",
      "With the Panthers putting all their energy into stopping McDavid, Draisaitl is taking over just about any time he's on the ice.",
      "\u201cLeon, I don't know what could be said that really conveys what he brings to our team \u2014 not only the leadership but the play,\u201d coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cHe has just elevated his game in the toughest moments.\u201d",
      "Draisaitl is making his case for the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, the award McDavid won last year in a losing effort and refused to leave the locker room to accept. He pulled even with McDavid as the favorite on BetMGM Sportsbook after scoring in overtime and tying him for the postseason scoring lead with 32 points.",
      "Asked how Draisaitl seems to be so automatic in overtime and other clutch situations, teammate Vasily Podkolzin responded: \"Because he\u2019s one of the best players in the world. That\u2019s why.\"",

      "The Murray State Racers are about to be embraced as the College World Series\u2019 lovable underdogs by local fans looking to adopt a team for the week",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Like Fresno State, Stony Brook and Oral Roberts before them, the Murray State Racers are about to be embraced as the College World Series' lovable underdogs by local fans looking to adopt a team for the week.",
      "Murray State merchandise already is selling fast among folks who are much more likely to identify the southwestern Kentucky school with basketball alums Ja Morant or Popeye Jones than the upstart ballclub making its CWS debut.",
      "As a No. 4 regional seed, the Racers (44-15) beat No. 10 national seed Mississippi of the SEC two out of three times on its home field and also took down the ACC's Georgia Tech. Then they won two of three at Duke in the super regionals. Up next is their CWS opener against No. 15 UCLA (47-16) on Saturday.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are cheering for us, but how many people actually believe in us that we can get it done?\u201d said Dustin Mercer, the team's leading hitter.",
      "There's plenty of belief in the clubhouse. Coach Dan Skirka and his players say their bond is unique for a team made up of eight transfers from four-year schools, 14 from junior colleges and 14 others players who started their careers with the Racers.",
      "The way they see it, their small-budget program has things money can't buy \u2014 players' trust in each other, love for each other and grittiness.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the bells and whistles,\u201d Skirka said.",
      "No, they don't. Murray State doled out $858,107 on baseball in the 2024 fiscal year. That's about one-tenth of the $9 million baseball budgets for the SEC's Arkansas and LSU, the biggest spenders in the CWS. The Racers were just under the 11.7 scholarship limit for this season.",
      "Skirka's most recent salary was listed at $91,000 on the state of Kentucky's transparency website, about 10 times less than the man who will be in the opposite dugout Saturday, UCLA's John Savage.",
      "The Racers ranked in the bottom half of Division I home attendance this season, averaging 375 fans per game at 800-seat Johnny Reagan Field. Contrary to several published reports, Skirka said he does not mow the grass, though his players do shovel snow off the field if necessary before early season practices and games.",
      "The 40-year-old Skirka is straight out of central casting as the Racers\u2019 seventh-year head coach. He grew up in Coldwater, Michigan, population 14,000, and played college ball about 90 minutes away at Division II Grand Valley State.",
      "Before he took over at Murray State, where he had been an assistant from 2009-14, he had been an assistant and head coach at junior colleges and an assistant at Division II Ouachita Baptist in Arkansas.",
      "\u201cHumble beginnings,\u201d Skirka said.",
      "Skirka's mantra is to squeeze everything he can out of his limited resources and then add a personal touch. Skirka said it's about recruiting the right people more than the right players. A lot of his team's success is the result of what has happened off the field. There were the team dinners at Skirka's house, bowling outings, creative conditioning drills and presentations players give in the fall about their lives outside baseball.",
      "\"The culture, I know it\u2019s clich\u00e9, but that\u2019s the number one thing on my mind 24/7,\" Skirka said. \u201cThat\u2019s what these guys want. That\u2019s what I promised them in the recruiting process.\u201d",
      "The Racers swept the Missouri Valley regular-season and tournament championships and have kept rolling. They're batting .357 and averaging 10.8 runs per game since the start of regionals.",
      "Mercer, in his third season with the Racers since transferring from Virginia Tech, is batting .360 for the season and .552 with seven doubles in the NCAA Tournament.",
      "Leadoff man Jonathan Hogart, who played at a junior college and Louisiana Tech before arriving at Murray State last year, has hit four of his team-best 22 homers in the postseason.",
      "Graham Kelham, who transferred from Division III Saint Francis after last season, has recorded saves in four of the Racers' five tournament wins.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s cool what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Oregon State pitcher Dax Whitney, who watched the Racers' 5-4 win over Duke on Monday. \u201cThey obviously earned the opportunity to be here. I don\u2019t think anybody should overlook them.\u201d",
      "Since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1999, Murray State is just the fourth No. 4 regional seed to make it to Omaha. Fresno State came out of the loser's bracket to win six games on its way to the 2008 national championship. Stony Brook went 0-2 with a pair of lopsided losses in 2012. Oral Roberts went 1-2 in 2023.",
      "Win or lose Saturday, the Racers will face either No. 3 national seed Arkansas or No. 6 LSU in their second game.",
      "The Racers say they're up for anything at this point. Skirka said he's been running on adrenaline and Red Bull since regionals.",
      "\u201cSince we\u2019ve landed it\u2019s been go, go, go,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the smile and look of just pure joy on these guys\u2019 faces. It\u2019s pure. They\u2019re having the time of their lives.\u201d",
      "So is Skirka.",
      "\u201cThanks to this group of Racers, they helped me get here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been awesome, and we\u2019re looking forward to a little bit of a lengthy stay here.\u201d",

      "But, they lost.",
      "Matthew Tkachuk and the stars of the defending champion Panthers smothered the Oilers in the first period.",
      "Edmonton\u2019s veterans responded fiercely, scoring four straight goals to take a 4-3 lead. The Panthers rebounded, scoring in the final seconds of the third period to force overtime. But, Oilers star Leon Draisaitl scored 11:18 into OT to give Edmonton a 5-4, series-tying victory Thursday night.",
      "What initially looked like an easy victory that would put Florida one win away from clinching a second straight Stanley Cup Final turned into a huge collapse that has the series tied 2-2 heading back to Edmonton.",
      "\u201cWe carried play in the first, they carried it in the second,\u201d Tkachuk said. \u201cSpecial teams were good for us in the first, special teams were good for them in the second. I think it was tighter than a 3-0 period at the start for us. And they clearly took control of play in the second. After two (periods) it\u2019s even, and it probably should have been. So, it doesn\u2019t matter how you how you start, you've got to treat it as zeros at the start of a period.\u201d",
      "It has been that kind of series so far \u2014 an evenly matched, back and forth heavyweight fight between two extremely experienced, resilient teams. The final has been so tight that three of four games have gone to overtime, marking just the eighth Stanley Cup Final \u2013 and fourth in the expansion era (since 1967-68) \u2014 to have three or more games require overtime.",
      "Despite the loss, Florida coach Paul Maurice said he could appreciate the competitiveness.",
      "\u201cI think we focus on sometimes the mistakes that get made by good players at times,\u201d Maurice said, \u201cand you miss some of the heart and soul and the intensity of it. It's so fast. Every board battle, everything can turn into something. ... Everything is dangerous all the time. So there's a mental intensity, a mental toughness I think both teams show that the game's not going to be over until it is.\u201d",
      "Sam Reinhart nearly saved the collapse Thursday when he scored a tying goal in the waning seconds of regulation. His score with 19.5 seconds left was the second-latest tying goal in Stanley Cup Final history. The record was set earlier in the series by Edmonton's Corey Perry in Game 2.",
      "Florida, which got a pair of early power-play goals from Tkachuk and an even-strength score from Anton Lundell, had never squandered a 3-0 lead in the postseason. Entering Thursday night, teams were 37-0 when leading a Stanley Cup Final game by three or more goals in the first period.",
      "After building the three-goal lead, Tkachuk said he felt the Panthers weren't connected. Reinhart added he felt they were playing too passively.",
      "\u201cI think we were watching the play develop,\u201d Reinhart said, \u201cas opposed to playing on our toes, and that\u2019s obviously how they got back in the game.\u201d",
      "Edmonton, boosted by second period goals from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Darnell Nurse and Vasily Podkolzin, became the seventh team in NHL history to overcome a three-goal deficit in the Stanley Cup Final to win.",
      "The Oilers also seemed to get a huge boost of momentum after coach Kris Knoblauch decided to pull starting goaltender Stuart Skinner after the Calvin Pickard allowed three goals in the first period.",
      "The good news for the Panthers is they\u2019ve responded well this postseason following letdowns.",
      "Florida seems to relish the moments when the pressure is the highest. That's what the experience of playing in their third straight Stanley Cup Final has taught the Panthers. And its a quality that will be needed if they're going to regroup from Game 4's disappointing finish.",
      "\u201cThe more times you go through it, the better,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be perfect. This time of year, we\u2019ve been here before. We\u2019ve been through it. So ... it\u2019s about recovering for Game 5.\u201d",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Pablo Reyes stumbled, stopped and still scrambled home safely on a wild play in the eighth inning Thursday night, taking advantage of a throwing error by reliever Lucas Erceg to give the New York Yankees a 1-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals.",
      "New York completed a three-game sweep to finish 6-0 against the Royals this season after eliminating them 3-1 in their best-of-five playoff series last October.",
      "Backed by some brilliant defense, Will Warren and four relievers combined on a five-hitter as the AL East-leading Yankees (42-25) moved a season-high 17 games over .500. They have the best road record in the majors at 21-13.",
      "Mark Leiter Jr. (4-3) got one out for the win, and Devin Williams earned his ninth save with a perfect ninth. He threw a called third strike past Jac Caglianone to end it, freezing the touted rookie with a full-count fastball.",
      "The game was interrupted by rain for 28 minutes in the top of the sixth.",
      "With two on and two outs in the eighth, Paul Goldschmidt lined a single off the glove of leaping first baseman Vinnie Pasquantino. He tracked down the ball behind him and threw to Erceg (1-2) covering first, but Goldschmidt beat the play.",
      "Reyes lost his balance coming around third, changed direction twice and then slid home safely when Erceg bounced his throw to the plate.",
      "Both starters pitched 5 2/3 scoreless innings. Seth Lugo allowed just two hits, while Warren permitted four.",
      "Pasquantino extended his hitting streak to a career-high 12 games and his on-base streak to a career-best 27 games.",
      "New York rested Aaron Judge, Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Austin Wells, who were a combined 7 for 23 with three homers and 10 RBIs in the first two games of the series.",
      "The Royals squandered two excellent chances to take their first lead of the series. In the second inning, they had runners on first and second with nobody out. In the fifth, they had a runner at third with one out.",
      "New York swept a season series from the Royals for the third time in their 57-year history. ... The Yankees have won 19 of the past 20 series between the teams.",
      "Yankees LHP Ryan Yarbrough (3-1, 4.17 ERA) faces Boston LHP Garrett Crochet (6-4, 2.35) in the opener of a three-game series Friday night at Fenway Park.",
      "Royals RHP Michael Wacha (3-5, 3.01 ERA) starts Friday at home against Athletics RHP Luis Severino (1-6, 4.77).",

      "Hader's strikeout of Slater to end it.",
      "Hader has the most saves without a blown save in the majors this season and his streak is the second longest in franchise history to start a season behind a 21-game streak by Dave Smith in 1989.",
      "The White Sox open a three-game series at Texas and the Astros play the opener of a three-game series against Minnesota on Friday.",

      "From an overhead view, the sight is somewhat jarring",
      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- For a six-lane interstate carving its way through a world-famous golf course, the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Oakmont is surprisingly unintrusive.",
      "From an overhead view, the sight is somewhat jarring \u2014 a wide expressway and railroad track dividing the course essentially in half. At ground level, however, the road is not much of a distraction. In fact, it can't be seen from much of Oakmont's layout.",
      "\u201cAnd honestly, you don't even really hear it,\u201d Oakmont historian David Moore said. \u201cIt's amazing how quiet it really is.\u201d",
      "Moore is an expert on this small stretch of the Turnpike \u2014 or Interstate 76, if you prefer. Its path through the course at Oakmont \u2014 the site of the U.S. Open this week \u2014 was originally just a train track.",
      "\u201cOne of the old history books here talks about how until diesel-powered trains came through, there'd be soot all over the first green, the ninth tee and all that,\" Moore said. \"They'd be driving by and set off all the smoke and just cover the place.\u201d",
      "This is not the Road Hole at St. Andrews. There's nothing quaint about the Turnpike at Oakmont. It also isn't \u2014 or at least, it shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 a factor in the course of play.",
      "With its slick greens and ferocious rough, Oakmont is difficult enough without adding a forced carry over a bunch of 18-wheelers.",
      "Holes Nos. 2-8 are to the east of the highway and all the rest are to the west. The first green and ninth tee, as well as the second tee and eighth green, converge on the two sides of the Turnpike, near a couple footbridges that allow fans to cross over the road.",
      "The biggest reason the roadway blends in when you're on the course is because there's an elevation change down to the highway. So the Turnpike presents largely as a gap in the middle of the course \u2014 if it\u2019s perceptible at all.",
      "There is no giant screen to prevent wayward balls from flying onto the road. The holes closest to the highway on the west side are generally perpendicular to it. Those on the east are more parallel, but it would take a pretty extraordinary miss to reach the Turnpike.",
      "That's not to say it can't happen. Moore tells the story of Cary Middlecoff hitting a ball toward the highway on No. 10 before withdrawing in disgust in 1953. Thirty years later, it was Tom Weiskopf on No. 8 working his way into Oakmont lore.",
      "\u201cHe flared one off to the right, it landed in a passing train, and it ended up in Cleveland,\" Moore said. \"The running joke around here: It was the longest tee shot ever hit.\u201d",
      "The more realistic concern the highway creates is for fans. Even with a second footbridge added between the 1994 and 2007 U.S. Opens, there's still a potential bottleneck in that area as fans cross over the traffic below \u2014 which on Thursday included some drivers honking their horns as they passed by golf's third major of the year.",
      "Foot traffic wasn't excessively slow, but it was enough of a slog that bouncing back and forth between one side and the other wasn't advisable.",
      "Near the bridges, the highway is flanked by a wall on the west side and some fencing on the east. The wall seems to do a better job of suppressing the noise from below, but on both sides, you might hear the road before you can see it.",
      "If you're looking for a decent view without crowding onto a bridge, the area behind the 10th green has a nice vantage point of the highway as it descends north toward the Allegheny River. A grandstand at the green on No. 12 offers a view of the Turnpike going the opposite direction.",
      "For the most part, the sheer size of Oakmont turns even a major roadway \u2014 which can take cars all the way to Philadelphia in one direction and Akron, Ohio, in the other \u2014 into something of an afterthought.",
      "\u201cYou don't really see it,\" Moore said. \"Twelve is really like the only hole where you look over it.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Cincinnati Reds left-hander Wade Miley is accused in court documents of providing drugs to the late Tyler Skaggs, a Los Angeles Angels pitcher who died of an accidental overdose in 2019.",
      "Skaggs' former agent, Ryan Hamill, said in a deposition that Skaggs told him he was using pain pills containing oxycodone, which were provided by Miley.",
      "The deposition is part of a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Skaggs' family against the Angels in California. A former publicist for the Angels, Eric Kay, was convicted in Texas of providing the fentanyl-laced pills that an autopsy said contributed to Skaggs' death. Kay was sentenced to 22 years in federal prison.",
      "Skaggs died in the team hotel in a Dallas suburb. His body was found hours before what was supposed to be the start of a series between the Angels and Texas Rangers.",
      "Miley is not facing criminal charges, and it's not the first time his name has come up in relation to Skaggs' death. During the sentencing phase of Kay's case, prosecutors used a recording of a conversation between Kay and his mother in which Kay said Miley was one of Skaggs' drug suppliers.",
      "The Reds had no comment Thursday, and Miley wasn't immediately available for comment.",
      "Matt Harvey, now a retired major league pitcher, testified during Kay's trial that he provided drugs to Skaggs. Harvey was later suspended for 60 days for violating MLB's drug policy. He didn't pitch in the major leagues again. Harvey and three other players also testified they received pills from Skaggs and described the recreational drug use they witnessed while with the Angels.",
      "Harvey and Skaggs were teammates with the Angels in 2019. Skaggs and Miley were teammates with the Arizona Diamondbacks from 2012-13.",
      "Hamill said the conversation in which Skaggs implicated Miley took place in 2013. Hamill had expressed concern to Skaggs' parents about what he said was erratic behavior from the pitcher in a phone conversation. Hamill said he and Skaggs' parents confronted Skaggs at home, leading to Skaggs' admission that he was using drugs and the accusation that Miley was supplying them.",
      "The 38-year-old Miley signed a one-year contract with the Reds on June 4 and has made two starts this season. He had Tommy John surgery on his left elbow in May 2024 and signed a minor league deal with Cincinnati in February.",
      "Miley had an opt-out clause if he didn\u2019t reach the big leagues by June 1. The 14-year veteran executed that clause but remained with Cincinnati while he pursued potential deals with other clubs before re-signing with the Reds.",

      "But the Pacers know if they were to partake in such thinking, that would be dangerous.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to get excited about right now,\u201d Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton said. \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way away.\u201d",
      "An even-keeled approach, for certain. The Thunder are going about business the same way.",
      "\u201cI just think we stay pretty emotionally even in all of the different experiences,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cYou really see that when we win. I think if you\u2019re going to get high on the wins, then the natural opposite of that is to get low on the losses. This team doesn\u2019t really swing violently between those two things. Never has.\u201d",

Add up those 7 minutes of play, and it was Thunder 23, Pacers 6. Add up the other 41 minutes of the game, and it was Pacers 110, Thunder 84.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a killer edge to beat these guys,\" Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be an underdog in every game in this series. ... It\u2019s a daunting challenge. Anything less than a total grit mindset, we just don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d",
      "If Oklahoma City finds a way Friday, it goes home with a 2-2 series tie and two of the final three games of the series set to be played in its building. A loss, and it's 3-1 \u2014 the sort of hole that few teams in NBA history have escaped.",
      "\u201cI think just the competitive greatness for this team has to be at an all-time high,\u201d Thunder guard Alex Caruso said. \u201cTo be able to go on the road and win a game is a difficult thing in the playoffs, but especially staring 3-1 down in the face. You got to really get your mind right and get ready for the preparation that it\u2019s going to take to go out there and compete for 48 minutes and get the win.\u201d",
      "Myles Turner, who had five blocks for Indiana in Game 3, including two against Oklahoma City's Chet Holmgren with about 2 minutes left \u2014 first a 3-pointer and then a 6-footer on the same possession \u2014 is dealing with an illness.",
      "Turner was with the Pacers for film on Thursday and then was sent home. It seems like Indiana expect that he will play in Game 4.",
      "Indiana hasn't lost back-to-back games in three months. Oklahoma City hasn't done so in two months.",
      "The Thunder are 6-0 after losses since early April, 5-0 after losses in these playoffs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a maximum four games left in the season,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you worked the whole season for. It\u2019s what you worked all summer for. To me, the way I see it, you got to suck it up, get it done and try to get a win.\u201d",
      "In five games against Oklahoma City this season, Haliburton has been fouled in the act of shooting just once \u2014 in the first half of a Thunder-Pacers game on March 29.",
      "He has not taken a free throw in this series. He's the first player to log at least 109 minutes in the first three games of a finals and not take a single free throw since Miami's Mario Chalmers in 2012 \u2014 also against the Thunder.",
      "In this current 16-team playoff format that dates back to 1984, Indiana is the sixth team to have a 2-1 lead in all four of its postseason series.",

We just trust our work, trust we got to get the ball into our guards\u2019 hands and they\u2019re going to make good plays.\u201d \u2014 Pacers forward Obi Toppin.",

      "There\u2019s no quicker way for a player to earn praise inside the dugout than with a little hustle",
      "DENVER -- Imagine this inspirational slogan on a T-shirt: Give 70% effort.",
      "It\u2019s not quite as catchy as the 110% baseball players have been instructed to exert since Little League. But maybe, just maybe, Jazz Chisholm Jr.\u2019s on to something with his theory that going 70% might be the way to be his best self \u2014 and cut down on strained obliques or pulled hamstrings in the process.",
      "Only, hustle is woven into the fabric of the game. Nicknames derive from it (Charlie Hustle) and awards are built around it ( Heart & Hustle ).",
      "This season, hustle has already come into play on several occasions. Most notably, when Juan Soto, the Mets $765 million star, didn\u2019t run hard to second base after smacking a ball high off the Green Monster at Fenway Park.",
      "In this modern era of baseball, where the average salary topped $5 million for the first time this season, the politics of hustle may play a role. There's the fundamental notion of hustle (run everything out) set against the possible ramifications of hustle (injuries to high-priced players).",
      "To the old guard, though, hustle is a non-negotiable. A lack thereof risks the wrath of not only teammates but a spot in a manager\u2019s doghouse. Which is why Chisholm\u2019s 70% mindset doesn\u2019t quite fly for Ron Washington, a gritty player back in the late 1970s and '80s who now manages the Los Angeles Angels.",
      "\u201cYou give the visual of 100% at all times,\" the 73-year-old Washington told The Associated Press. \"The only person who knows you\u2019re 70% is you, but don\u2019t tell people you\u2019re 70%, so when they see you dog it, they say, \u2018Well, he\u2019s only 70%.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Baseball Almanac defines hustle as \u201cto play aggressively, quickly, and alertly.\u201d",
      "Translation: You know it when you see it.",
      "Two months ago, Braves star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. criticized manager Brian Snitker\u2019s lack of response to Jarred Kelenic failing to hustle out of the batter\u2019s box. Acu\u00f1a was removed from a Braves game on Aug. 19, 2019, when he was slow to leave the batter\u2019s box on a long drive that bounced off the right-field wall for a long single.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no blanket thing,\u201d Snitker said after the Kelenic situation on removing players for lack of hustle.",
      "To Washington, the definition of hustle has \u201cchanged in this generation,\u201d he said. \u201dBecause (the lack of hustle) wouldn\u2019t have been allowed in other generations. ... Now people don\u2019t want to pull their best player off the field when he acts like an (expletive). I\u2019m sorry. They don\u2019t want to pull him. Because you pull him, you just gutted the whole team.",
      "\u201cBack in the day, they didn\u2019t care. You didn\u2019t hustle, your (butt) is off the field. And you know who took care of it when they took you off the field? The players. Not management. Not the manager, not the coaches. The players took care of it.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s Vinny Castilla\u2019s take, too. The two-time All-Star for the Colorado Rockies in the 1990s had veterans pull him aside when sometimes \u201cyou don\u2019t feel too good and you don\u2019t go 100%.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe veterans step in and say, \u2018Hey, man, you\u2019ve got to do it. You\u2019ve got to hustle every day,'\u201d Castilla said. \u201cHustle doesn\u2019t change. ... Some players love to play hard and get their uniform dirty, and some players don\u2019t like to do it.\"",
      "Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said that he generally expects players to give 100% each day, but that\u2019s relative to how their feeling. As a recent example, Lovullo cited star outfielder Corbin Carroll, who was nursing a tight hamstring during a series in Cincinnati.",
      "\u201cFor Corbin the past couple days, just give me 100% of what you have,\" Lovullo said. \"So, yeah, we\u2019ll protect players.\u201d",
      "In most cases, Lovullo said, hustle is a hard thing to turn on and off.",
      "\u201cIf a player is healthy, I feel like there\u2019s no reason to not go 100%. To run fast, you\u2019ve got to practice running fast,\" he said. \"To throw hard, you\u2019ve got to practice throwing hard. You can\u2019t turn it on and off. I think you\u2019re risking injury when you don\u2019t go hard and then all (of a) sudden you need to go hard.\"",
      "Chisholm believes he found the key to playing well and staying healthy by going 70%. The New York Yankees infielder postulated that his success since returning from the injured list has been caused by limiting intensity.",
      "\u201cPlay at 70%: defense, offense, running, everything,\u201d Chisholm said. \"Stay healthy. You don\u2019t overswing. You don\u2019t swing and miss as much, and you\u2019re a great player at 70%.\u201d",
      "Of course, that wouldn\u2019t have gone over well with \u201cCharlie Hustle\u201d himself \u2014 the late Pete Rose, who elevated hustling to an art form.",
      "That was also before the age of the viral bat flip. Admiring homers is not just permitted, it's encouraged \u2014 and doesn't result in a fastball to the ribs the next go-around at the plate. In Soto's case, he appeared slow out of the box after watching what he thought was a homer.",
      "It's a different time from Washington's day.",
      "\u201cThe game became young and it got to the point where we don\u2019t want to hurt nobody\u2019s feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember (longtime big-league manager) Gene Mauch giving a (expletive) about hurting my feelings. ... You didn\u2019t get the job done, then I\u2019m letting you know you didn\u2019t get the job done. And if you don\u2019t want me screaming at you, guess what you better do? Get the job done!\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a balancing act for sure.",
      "\u201cSome days are tougher than others. We always say that,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \"We\u2019re going to play hard for 27 outs. There\u2019s gonna be days where Woody (22-year-old budding star James Wood) sometimes will run out a groundball because he knows he\u2019 got a chance to make it. There will be some days where he hits a 110-mph one-hopper where he doesn\u2019t go hard out of the box, and I can understand that.\u201d",
      "Hustle, much like Chisholm\u2019s theory, remains complicated.",
      "\u201cSome of it is what you would call eyewash, and some of it\u2019s real,\u201d Brewers manager Pat Murphy explained. \u201cReal hustle means staying present in the game and staying on the game, being relentless in pitch-to-pitch readiness. Sometimes you can\u2019t even see it. I can see it.",
      "\u201cYour mind\u2019s decided on something else. You\u2019re worried about your contract or you\u2019re worried about next year or you\u2019re worried about a .300 batting average versus .299. I look at that as kind of lack of proper focus, not necessarily not hustling, the actual physical hustle. I think these guys play their (butts) off.\u201d",
      "Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger learned the importance of hustle through a stare. He and his teammates growing up called it the \u201cClay Stare.\u201d It was the look from Bellinger\u2019s father, Clay, his longtime coach who helped instill the values of the game.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t ever want the \u2018Clay Stare,\u2019\u201d Bellinger said. \u201cMy dad was always like, \u2018Hey, run balls out. People are always watching.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bellinger's been benched in his career, like when he was with the Dodgers in 2018 and manager Dave Roberts sat him for not hustling on a double.",
      "\u201cHustle, I think, it\u2019s one of the few things in this game you can control,\u201d Bellinger said. \u201cYou can\u2019t control where you hit the ball. But you can always control hustle and energy.\u201d",

      "The latest effort by Congress to regulate college sports is generating predictable partisan outrage",
      "WASHINGTON -- The latest effort by Congress to regulate college sports generated predictable partisan outrage on Thursday, with Democrats saying Republican-led draft legislation would claw back freedoms won by athletes through years of litigation against the NCAA.",
      "Three House committees are considering legislation that would create a national standard for name, image and likeness payments to athletes and protect the NCAA against future lawsuits. Last week, a federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will lead to schools paying athletes directly, and NCAA President Charlie Baker said now that his organization is implementing those major changes, Congress needs to step in and stabilize college sports.",
      "Baker said he supports the draft legislation that was the subject of Thursday's hearing by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, but there was little indication that any bill advanced by the House would generate enough Democratic support to surpass the 60-vote threshold in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply disappointed for the second year in a row, Republicans on this committee are advancing a partisan college sports bill that protects the power brokers of college athletics at the expense of the athletes themselves,\u201d said Rep. Lori Trahan, D-Mass.",
      "Trahan noted that if the NCAA or conferences establish unfair rules, athletes can challenge them in court, with the settlement of the House v. NCAA antitrust case the latest example of athletes winning rights that they had been denied historically.",
      "\u201cThis bill rewrites that process to guarantee the people in power always win, and the athletes who fuel this multibillion-dollar industry always lose,\u201d said Trahan, who played volleyball at Georgetown.",
      "The NCAA argues that it needs a limited antitrust exemption in order to set its own rules and preserve a college sports system that provides billions of dollars in scholarships and helps train future U.S. Olympians. Several athletes are suing the NCAA over its rule that athletes are only eligible to play four seasons in a five-year period, and on Tuesday, a group of female athletes filed an appeal of the House settlement, saying it discriminated against women in violation of federal law.",
      "On the Senate side, a bipartisan group including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas has been negotiating a college sports reform bill for months, but those talks are moving more slowly than Cruz had hoped at the beginning of this Congress.",
      "The draft bill in the House would create a national standard for NIL, overriding the state laws that critics say have led to a chaotic recruiting environment. That, too, was criticized by Democrats and by their key witness at the hearing, Ramogi Huma, executive director of the National College Players Association.",
      "Huma argued that the NCAA wants to get rid of booster-funded NIL collectives that another witness, Southeastern Conference associate commissioner William King, characterized as \u201cfake NIL\u201d or \u201cpay for play.\u201d",
      "Instead, Huma said the collectives are examples of the free market at work, noting that before players won NIL rights through a court case, boosters could only donate to athletic departments.",
      "Tom McMillen, a former Democratic congressman who played in the NBA after an All-America basketball career at Maryland, took a dim view of the bill's prospects.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to come up with something and pull in some Democrats. I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to succeed or not,\u201d said McMillen, who for several years led an association of Division I athletic directors. \u201cThere's a real philosophical divide, so that's the hard part. It's hard to bridge. And there's a zillion other issues.\u201d",
      "The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., said the draft legislation already had some bipartisan support and he was open to changes that would get more Democrats on board.",
      "\u201cI will consider some of the suggestions, the legitimate suggestions that were made,\u201d Bilirakis said, \u201cand I will be happy to talk to lawmakers that truly want to get a big bill across the finish line.\u201d",

      "It was a landmark day for Australia captain Pat Cummins, who took 6-28 to get to 300 wickets in his test career and dismiss the Proteas for 138 following a whirlwind hour after lunch when the Baggy Greens claimed South Africa's last five batters for 12 runs in 5.5 overs.",

      "Daniel Suarez has become the unofficial tour guide for all things Mexico City as NASCAR prepares to race internationally this Sunday for the first international points-paying Cup Series event of the modern era",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Daniel Suarez has become the unofficial tour guide for all things Mexico City as NASCAR prepares to race internationally this Sunday for the first international points-paying Cup Series event of the modern era.",
      "From where to eat, what to do, how to navigate the city and even basic conversation in Spanish, Suarez has been the go-to guy in the garage since NASCAR said it would take the Cup Series outside the United States for just the third time in 77 years.",
      "The Monterrey native has made multiple trips to NASCAR as the face of Sunday's race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, where he's raced on a different course layout 13 times, with three wins in NASCAR's Mexico Series.",
      "He'd like to win at the Cup level \u2014 if he pulls it out in his home country Sunday it will be his first victory of this season \u2014 but Suarez is juggling a very difficult balancing act. He's elated to be racing in front of a home crowd, honored to show of the culture and magic of Mexico City, but at the same time tremendously concerned about his NASCAR future.",
      "Suarez is in a contract year with Trackhouse Racing, which has Ross Chastain and Shane van Ginsberg under contract while Connor Zilisch is its development driver and on loan to several teams at lower national levels of NASCAR racing.",
      "Trackhouse only has three Cup Series seats, math Suarez can't ignore as he heads into Sunday ranked 28th in the standings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time that I\u2019ve been in this position. Definitely the first time with the Mexico race, but it\u2019s not the first time that I\u2019ve been in the position that we have to win or in the position that we have a contract negotiation in the middle of the season,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a distraction. I won\u2019t sit here and tell you that it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m trying to be as smart as possible and to put all this stuff on the side and just do my thing on the track.\u201d",
      "Suarez, the only Mexican-born driver to win a NASCAR national series race, has two Cup victories, three Xfinity Series wins and one Truck Series win. His 2016 championship in the second-tier Xfinity Series made him the only foreign-born driver to win a national series title.",
      "Suarez has faced adversity before, but never like the pressure he's feeling hoping to deliver in front of the local crowd. This weekend in Mexico is special to Suarez, who expects well over 100 of the spectators in attendance Sunday to be friends and family.",
      "They've watched from afar as he's worked his way into the NASCAR spotlight, a journey full of ups and downs that have seen Suarez drive for four different Cup teams. He joined Trackhouse Racing in 2021 and last year signed a one-year extension through 2025.",
      "At the time, he said he wanted to reassess where the program was before signing a long-term deal. But it's been a disappointing start to the season and his average finish of 21st is three spots worse than last year.",
      "\u201cThe Mexico race is something that I\u2019ve been hoping and waiting on for many, many years, and I\u2019m not going to let anything else from outside take that week and that moment from myself,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cWe have to just continue to put one foot in front of the other and continue to move forward. I think that in Trackhouse, we have found some decent speed in the last few weeks, so that\u2019s promising, and hopefully we can continue to move in that direction.\u201d",
      "Suarez will have Mexican communication company Telcel on his car this weekend.",
      "\u201cFor many years, I never had a sponsor deal with a company from Mexico because I wasn\u2019t racing there,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cSo right now that we\u2019re going to be having an event down there, it opens a whole new world of opportunities and that\u2019s great, obviously for me, but for the entire sport.\u201d",
      "It's another layer of pressure for Suarez, who wants nothing more than to balance the demands of being the star of Sunday's show with delivering a strong showing.",
      "\"Once we get into the race, we don\u2019t want to deal with any of this stuff, and I just want to focus and have fun driving race cars,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is going to be more on my plate just by nature, just being the local guy, the very first race ever in Mexico City in the Cup Series. I have to accept that. With that being said, I have to protect my space for the competition stuff because if we don\u2019t do the competition stuff right, everything else doesn\u2019t really matter. So we have to put a balance on everything.\u201d",
      "As Suarez noted, a win on Sunday would dramatically improve his hopes of remaining with Trackhouse on a contract extension. It could happen: Suarez's first Cup victory came on the road course at Sonoma, and the next five Cup races include road-course races at Mexico City, Sonoma and the Chicago street course.",
      "He admitted \u201chonestly, I don't know\u201d about what he'd like out of a contract extension, but said he speaks regularly with team owner Justin Marks.",
      "\u201cThe trajectory of Trackhouse has been tremendous,\u201d Su\u00e1rez said. \u201cWe have learned so many things. I really want to help Justin bring Trackhouse to the next level. I believe that 2022 has been our best year as a company, still. So why is that? Are we missing something? Do we have to change something? What do we need to do better? As a new team, to have your best years that early, it\u2019s kind of uncommon. One of the reasons, I believe, was because of the new car. So I believe that we have to continue to grow.",
      "\u201cRoss just won a race a couple weeks ago, and that\u2019s brought a lot of energy to the team and some more momentum. Before that, it was a little bit of a struggle. So we have to continue to find that speed in a consistent basis, just like the big teams,\" he continued. \"So we\u2019re having all these conversations. I wish I didn\u2019t have to have these conversations, and I didn\u2019t have these distractions, but it\u2019s part of life, right? Sometimes you have to do several things at the same time. But I\u2019m trying not to think about it too much and trying to work in my job and push as hard as possible for competition and trying to help the team slowly get better and better.\u201d",

      "There are high expectations everywhere at the major known as the toughest test in golf \u2014 for Scottie Scheffler, the world No. 1; for Bryson DeChambeau, the defending champion; and for everyone to face an Oakmont course reputed to be the toughest in the land.",
      "\u201cOakmont is relentless,\u201d said John Bodenhamer, the chief championships officer at the USGA who sets up the course. \u201cThere\u2019s no let up. It\u2019s a grind. That\u2019s the U.S. Open.\u201d",
      "The USGA is particularly fond of Oakmont, a big reason why the U.S. Open returns to his course for a record 10th time.",
      "It has been on the minds of all 156 players \u2014 from Scheffler and Masters champion Rory McIlroy to the 15 amateurs, and for the 16 players, like Vogt, who had to make it through 18 holes of local qualifying and then 36 holes.",
      "Zac Blair had the first birdie of this championship, holing a putt from nearly 45 feet on the 10th hole after starting his round on the back nine.",
      "Alistair Docherty suffered the first of what figures to be plenty of crashes. From just short of the 10th green, it took him two hacks to get it out of the cabbage-like rough, the second chip rolling and rolling some 12 feet by the hole.",
      "That's what Oakmont does \u2014 thick, gnarly rough and some of the fastest putting surfaces around. The USGA pointed out on the eve of the championship that only 27 of the 1,385 players who have competed in a major championship at Oakmont finished under par.",

      "The newly-crowned European champion can add the world title to a trophy haul that also included a French league and cup double this season.",
      "\u201cWe want to finish the season in style with the cherry on the cake,\u201d coach Luis Enrique said.",
      "PSG had already qualified for the rebooted Club World Cup in the United States, but its Champions League triumph may still have come as a relief to FIFA.",
      "That's because, while the winner of the bumper tournament will officially be crowned the best club soccer team in the world, there are some notable absentees from the 32-team roster.",
      "The Club World Cup will be without the champion of the most popular league in the world \u2014 the Premier League \u2014 given Liverpool's failure to meet the qualifying criteria.",
      "The same goes for Barcelona and Napoli -- champions of Spain and Italy, respectively.",
      "No place either for current Asian champion Al-Ahli from Saudi Arabia or Pyramids \u2014 the African champion from Egypt.",
      "FIFA likely breathed a sigh of relief then when PSG and Inter Milan advanced to the final of the Champions League, with both teams having already secured their place at the Club World Cup via ranking points for recent runs in Europe's top club competition. Had either of the losing semifinalists \u2014 Barcelona or Arsenal \u2014 gone on to lift the trophy, then the flagship new tournament would have been without the reigning champion of Europe as well.",
      "The qualifying criteria were based on winners of continental trophies in the four years prior to the tournament, but not including the season directly before it.",
      "That's why Chelsea \u2014 Champions League winner in 2021 \u2014 has a seat at the table despite finishing fourth in the Premier League last month. Chelsea is arriving at the Club World Cup with a new team, coach and even owners since it won the Champions League four years ago.",
      "The club is one of 12 from Europe, including stellar names like Real Madrid, PSG, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Inter and Juventus.",
      "Some of Latin America's biggest teams are in the tournament \u2014 including reigning Copa Libertadores champion Botafogo from Brazil. Three other Brazilian teams have qualified: Palmeiras, Flamengo and Fluminense.",
      "Argentina's famous rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors will also be there \u2014 and are expected to be backed by thousands of fans traveling to the U.S.",
      "It is the Latin American contingent that likely will likely present the biggest challenge to the European teams.",
      "\u201cEveryone wants to compete \u2014 the question is how you prepare to win, to try to win. That\u2019s what challenges me,\u201d said Marcelo Gallardo, River Plate head coach. \u201cI want to win. I don\u2019t want to just go and see what happens.\u201d",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes the tournament is what the sport has been waiting for \u2014 a world championship for club soccer.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the 32 best clubs in the world will compete in a tournament to determine finally who is the best club in the world,\u201d he said this week.",
      "In its previous format, which involved a mini-tournament of just seven teams instead of 32, it never fully captured global interest. Played in the middle of the season for Europe\u2019s top leagues, it had the feel of an exhibition, rather than a serious tournament. European teams dominated the modern era, winning all but one of the last 17 editions.",
      "The new format will be a much more exacting examination of the eventual winner \u2014 not least because there are so many teams from Europe, but also because there has been a marked drive to improve levels in countries like the U.S. and Saudi Arabia following a slew of star signings such as Lionel Messi, who has transformed Inter Miami.",
      "However, it remains unclear how much of an appetite there is among fans for another elite tournament in a calendar that is already saturated.",
      "Details on ticket sales have not been released, but prices have dropped as the tournament has drawn closer and seats for the opening game between Al Ahly and Inter Miami on Saturday were still available this week.",
      "Marriott Bonvoy, a U.S. Soccer Federation partner, has been offering free tickets to some of its elite members for some games.",
      "It also remains to be seen what the television viewing figures will be, with the tournament broadcast globally on streaming service DAZN, which has also made 24 matches available with English-language commentary to TNT in the U.S.",
      "Al Ahly vs. Inter Miami, June 14, Miami",
      "Five years after its MLS debut, Inter Miami \u2014 the team owned by David Beckham \u2014 will kick off in the first game of the Club World Cup. Its opponent in the opener is Egypt's Al Ahly \u2014 the winner of a record 12 African championships. It's likely to be party time at the Hard Rock Stadium, but the chance of Al Ahly spoiling Miami's big day is very real.",
      "PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, June 15, Los Angeles",
      "It will be an early test for PSG against Atletico. This is the type of match that could grace the later stages of any Champions League campaign between two of Europe's finest.",
      "Chelsea vs. LAFC, June 16, Atlanta",
      "LAFC got in through the back door via a playoff against Club America of Mexico and its reward is an opening game against two-time Champions League winner Chelsea.",
      "Real Madrid vs. Al-Hilal, June 18, Miami",
      "The anticipation around this one would have been so much more intense had Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal not released Neymar in January, but it still has other star signings like striker Aleksandar Mitrovic. Madrid has a new coach in Xabi Alonso, who can get off to a flying start by winning the world title.",
      "PSG vs. Botafogo, June 19, Los Angeles",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",
      "It hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d",
      "Meta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.",
      "\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.",
      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",

      "The married victims were identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Tanisha Finley, 43, and Rodney Finley, 44. Both died of multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "Las Vegas police said the shooting on Sunday night near the landmark Bellagio fountains was an isolated incident between the victims and the suspect, who had been feuding on social media since at least 2023. The suspect, identified by police as Manuel D. Ruiz, surrendered to authorities Monday morning at a police station outside of Las Vegas.",
      "Ruiz, 41, faces two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and is being held without bail, jail records show.",

      "In his interview with police after he surrendered, the suspect said he also has a YouTube channel and had been livestreaming from the Strip on the night of the shooting. Ruiz told police began shooting because it looked like one of the victims was reaching for a weapon, according to the report.",
      "Police said no firearms were found on the victims.",
      "The shooting happened on one of the busiest stretches of the Strip. The dancing Bellagio fountains, which soar up to 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, play every 15 minutes on the weekends between 8 p.m. and midnight.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A chartered spaceflight for India, Poland and Hungary\u2019s first astronauts in decades has been delayed indefinitely because of leak concerns at the International Space Station.",
      "NASA said Thursday that it wants to monitor the cabin pressure on the Russian side of the orbiting lab before accepting visitors. Officials stressed that the seven astronauts currently at the space station are safe and that other operations up there aren't affected.",
      "SpaceX was supposed to launch four private astronauts this week on a 14-day space station mission, but bad weather and SpaceX rocket trouble delayed the flight. Then the station leak issue cropped up.",
      "The Russian Space Agency has been dealing with a cabin pressure leak at the station, and recent repairs resulted in what NASA calls \u201ca new pressure signature.\u201d Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "The three Russians aboard the space station recently inspected the inside walls of the aging Zvezda service module, which was launched in 2000. They sealed some areas and measured the current leak rate.",
      "\u201cFollowing this effort, the segment now is holding pressure,\u201d NASA said in an online update.",
      "The private mission's delay provides extra time for NASA and the Russian Space Agency \u201cto evaluate the situation\u201d and determine whether more repairs are needed.",
      "The chartered flight was arranged by the Houston company Axiom Space, and was to be Axiom's fourth trip to the space station with paying customers since 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is the right thing to do,\u201d Axiom Space's executive chairman Kam Ghaffarian said in a written statement. \u201cWe will continue to work with all of our partners to finalize a new launch date.\u201d",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",
      "\u201cBut now we are realizing they are also shaping the ecosystems by producing and spreading information,\u201d she said.",

      "Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity. Tech companies are now tapping into an older repository of knowledge: the library stacks.",
      "Nearly one million books published as early as the 15th century \u2014 and in 254 languages \u2014 are part of a Harvard University collection being released to AI researchers Thursday. Also coming soon are troves of old newspapers and government documents held by Boston's public library.",
      "Cracking open the vaults to centuries-old tomes could be a data bonanza for tech companies battling lawsuits from living novelists, visual artistsand others whose creative works have been scooped up without their consent to train AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cIt is a prudent decision to start with public domain data because that\u2019s less controversial right now than content that\u2019s still under copyright,\u201d said Burton Davis, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft.",
      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",

      "A salvage company plans to lift the luxury yacht Bayesian in late June from the Sicilian seabed where it sank last summer, killing seven people",
      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "In a post on his X social media platform, Musk said the date could change because Tesla is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Investors, Wall Street analysts and Tesla enthusiasts have been anticipating the rollout of the driverless cabs since Musk said earlier this year that the service would launch in Austin sometime in June.",
      "Last month, Musk told CNBC that the taxis will be remotely monitored at first and \u201cgeofenced\u201d to certain areas of the city deemed the safest to navigate. He said he expected to initially run 10 or so taxis, increase that number rapidly and start offering the service in Los Angeles, San Antonio, San Francisco and other cities.",
      "Musk has been promising fully autonomous, self-driving vehicles \u201cnext year\u201d for a decade, but the pressure is on now as Tesla actually begins to operate a self-driving taxi service. Sales of Tesla\u2019s electric vehicles have sagged due to increased competition, the retooling of its most popular car, the Model Y, and the fallout from Musk\u2019s turn to politics.",
      "The Austin rollout also comes after Musk had a public blowup with President Donald Trump over the administration\u2019s tax bill. Some analysts have expressed concern that Trump could retaliate by encouraging federal safety regulators to to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",

      "Hong Kong police have accused a mobile game application of advocating armed revolution and promoting secessionist agendas",
      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong police on Tuesday accused a mobile game application of advocating armed revolution and promoting secessionist agendas, saying that those who publish it or share it with others online may risk violating national security laws.",
      "The announcement \u2014 the first to publicly denounce a gaming app \u2014 indicates that authorities are widening the crackdown that has followed anti-government protests in 2019. Authorities have crushed or silenced many dissenting voices through prosecutions under the 2020 national security law imposed by Beijing and a similar, homegrown law enacted last year.",
      "In a statement, police warned residents against downloading the \u201cReversed Front: Bonfire\" application, saying those with the app installed might be seen as possessing a publication with a seditious intention.",
      "They also warned people against providing financial assistance to the application developer, including making in-app purchases.",
      "\u201c'Reversed Front: Bonfire' was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 and \u2018Hong Kong independence,\u2019 advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d police said.",
      "The game application was developed by ESC Taiwan, which did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. On the application's Facebook page, the developer posted about surging searches for the game name and a Hong Kong broadcaster\u2019s news report about Tuesday\u2019s development.",
      "According to the application\u2019s introduction, players can assume the role of Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghur, Taiwan or Cathaysian Rebel factions, among others, to overthrow the communist regime. They may also choose to lead the communists to defeat all enemies.",
      "The game\u2019s website says it \u201cis a work of nonfiction. Any similarity to actual agencies, policies or ethnic groups of the PRC in this game is intentional.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday night, the app was still available on Apple's App Store but not on the Google Play store. The game publisher last month said Google Play had taken the app down because it did not prohibit users from adopting hateful language in naming.",
      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
      "After playing the game for about three months, Kuo Hao Fu in Taiwan said he found that its content uses a humorous approach to describe serious political issues. Fu disagreed with the police accusations, saying players can also choose to be part of the force representing China.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong police's actions demonstrate how Hong Kong's democratic freedoms have been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen even this level cannot be tolerated, it completely destroys creative freedom in gaming.\u201d",
      "China considers Taiwan its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Many Taiwanese in the self-ruled island showed concerns about Hong Kong's declining freedoms under Beijing's grip.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the city's national security laws were necessary to return stability to the city following the protests.",

      "Pavel appointed Eva Decroix after her predecessor Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from the post on May 30. He was under fire from the opposition because his ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($46 million) earlier this year.",
      "Bla\u017eek said that he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said that he appreciated his resignation and believed that Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",
      "Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.",

      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",

      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",

      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",

      "SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm, saw its share price increase by more than 400% after it announced plans to buy up to $425 million in Ethereum, the second most popular form of cryptocurrency. And crypto firm Upexi saw its stock price soar more than 300% after it announced plans to buy $100 million of Solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin ecosystem.",

      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",

      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",

Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms.

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges, one week after he was brought back to the Unites States from detention in El Salvador.",
    "story": [
      "He was bought back to the U.S. last Friday to face criminal  charges.",
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty Friday to human smuggling charges, one week after he was brought back to the Unites States from detention in El Salvador.",
      "The 29-year-old entered his plea at his arraignment in Tennessee, where federal prosecutors have charged him with transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. in what they say was a conspiracy involving the domestic transport of thousands of noncitizens from Mexico and Central America, including some children, in exchange for thousands of dollars.",
      "Following his plea, the judge began hearing arguments over whether to hold a pre-trial detention hearing in order to determine if Abrego Garcia should continue to be held in custody pending trial. That hearing, if approved, would occur next.",
      "The government's first witness in making its case for detention was Homeland Security special agent Pete Joseph, who testified about his investigation into the 2022 traffic stop where Abrego Garcia was pulled over for speeding in a vehicle with eight passengers, and told police they had been working construction in Missouri.",
      "The Tennessee Highway Patrol officers ultimately issued no speeding ticket and allowed Abrego Garcia to drive on with just a warning about an expired driver's license,",
      "As ABC News previously reported, the criminal investigation that led to the charges was launched in April as federal authorities began to scrutinize the traffic stop.",
      "Abrego Garcia has been the subject of a prolonged legal battle since he was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which his family and attorneys deny.",
      "The Trump administration, after arguing for nearly two months that it was unable to being him back, returned him the U.S. last week to face a two-count indictment alleging that, while living with his wife and children in Maryland, he participated in a yearslong conspiracy to haul undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country.",
      "In a court filing on Monday, prosecutors acknowledged that Abrego Garcia would almost certainly be immediately taken in custody by ICE if U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes was to deny their motion for pre-trial detention -- but they asked the court to consider, for the sake of argument, the possibility that he \"would have an enormous reason to flee\" if he were not immediately detained by ICE.",
      "They also argued that Abrego-Garcia's alleged MS-13 ties put him at risk of attempting to obstruct justice or intimidate potential witnesses against him, including his alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"The United States would submit that at least one co-conspirator has described that the Defendant has previously used his membership in MS-13 not just to facilitate his illegal activity in the smuggling conspiracy but also to intimidate others in the conspiracy who attempted to confront him about the treatment of female smuggling victims and his smuggling of firearms and drugs which added to the conspiracy's risk of detection and were not a goal of the overall conspiracy,\" the government's filing said.",
      "In response, attorneys for Abrego Garcia said in a filing Wednesday that the Trump administration's arguments for a detention hearing are meritless.",
      "\"It should also come as no surprise that the government has not cited a single case holding that a generic alien-smuggling charge provides grounds for a detention hearing,\" Abrego Garcia's attorneys said. \"This case should not be the first.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys also argued in the filing that their client is not a flight risk, and said that the government \"points to zero facts\" suggesting Abrego Garcia has a history of evading arrest, has any prior restrictions, or has \"systematically engaged in international travel in the recent past.\"",
      "The attorneys also argued that there is no \"serious risk\" Abrego Garcia will obstruct justice, arguing that the government's \"baseless gang-affiliation allegations\" do not support a finding that he poses a \"serious risk\" of obstructive behavior.",
      "\"[The] government is not entitled to seek detention in this case, Mr. Abrego Garcia respectfully asks the Court to deny the government's motion for detention,\" the attorneys said.",

    "story": [
      "The next step is a vote from the CDC's vaccine advisory committee.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded its approval of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine on Thursday to include adults under the age of 60 at increased risk of the disease.",
      "Previously, the vaccine, known as mRESVIA, had been licensed for use for those aged 60 and older.",
      "Approval for mRESVIA came after Moderna conducted a late-stage clinical trial showing the vaccine helped boost immune responses in younger adults.",
      "More than one-third of adults between ages 18 and 59 have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of RSV, according to Moderna.",
      "\"RSV poses a serious health risk to adults with certain chronic conditions, and today's approval marks an important step forward in our ability to protect additional populations from severe illness from RSV,\" St\u00e9phane Bancel, CEO of Moderna, said in a press release. \"We appreciate the FDA's review and thank all the participants in our clinical trial as well as the Moderna team for their dedication to protecting people against RSV.\"",
      "Although the FDA approves vaccines and may expand approvals for certain age groups, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sets recommendations regarding who should get vaccines and when.",
      "Currently, the CDC recommends RSV vaccination only for those aged 75 and older and for those aged 60 and over at increased risk.",
      "The CDC's independent vaccine advisory committee will need to vote to recommend that the new age group be eligible for the shot, followed by a final recommendation from the director of the CDC.",
      "Earlier this week, Kennedy removed all 17 sitting members of the committee and replaced them with eight new members. It remains unclear how the new members of the panel will decide to approach recommendations for the RSV vaccine.",
      "As of Friday, the CDC director role remains vacant and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been making final recommendations. In an April meeting, the prior advisory committee voted to recommend RSV vaccination for those aged 50 to 59 with increased risk of disease, but Kennedy did not adopt the recommendations.",
      "Instead, it appears Kennedy plans to have the new committee re-discuss the recommendations for RSV vaccination as well as discuss HPV and COVID vaccinations in their meeting scheduled to be held between June 25 and June 27",
      "Moderna's RSV vaccine is based on mRNA technology, which some of the new members have expressed skepticism about, especially in relation to COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Despite availability, RSV vaccination has been lagging. As of April 26, the latest date for which CDC data is available, an estimated 47.5% of adults aged 75 and older and 38.1% of adults aged 60 to 74 with a high-risk condition reported ever having received an RSV vaccine.",

    "summary": "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Protests are set to take place in more than 2,000 communities around the U.S.",
      "Thousands of \"No Kings Day\" protests are set to be held throughout the country on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump's administration and to counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday.",
      "Here's what to know about the protests.",
      "What is the idea behind \"No Kings Day\"?",
      "\"'No Kings Day' is the largest single-day, peaceful protest in recent American history, made up of millions of normal, everyday Americans who are showing up in more than 2,000 communities around the country to say, 'we don't do kings in America,'\" Ezra Levin, the co-executive director of progressive organizing group Indivisible, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Indivisible and other organizations involved with the coalition coordinating the protests have said that the protests are meant to protest what they say is overreach by the Trump administration on immigration enforcement and deportations, civil rights and cuts to the federal government.",
      "They've also pointed to how the military parade is being held on Trump's birthday. Trump has denied any connection between the parade's timing and his birthday, pointing to how June 14 is Flag Day.",
      "The groups coordinating the protests originally announced the initiatives in early May, after reports of the upcoming military parade, but organizers have said that the protests against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles and the response from the federal government have driven much more interest to the events.",
      "Where and when will the protests be?",
      "The protests will be held across the country and even beyond the United States, with a flagship event held in Philadelphia. Levin told ABC News there are now more than 2,000 events planned \"just about everywhere, everywhere but downtown D.C. -- intentionally so.\"",
      "According to Levin, the organizers did not want to give Trump a rationale to retaliate against peaceful protests in D.C. or to say that the protesters were protesting the military.",
      "\"We are ceding downtown D.C. Trump can have it for that day, and instead, we're organizing literally everywhere else,\" Levin said.",
      "Most of the protests around the country will be held in the morning, ahead of the parade. Some in the western part of the country may occur concurrently with the parade, which is set to kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET.",
      "What has Trump said about the protests?",
      "Asked on Thursday about his thoughts on the \"No Kings\" protests planned across the country for Saturday, Trump said he did not feel like a king.",
      "\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said.",
      "\"A king would say, 'I'm not gonna get this'... he wouldn't have to call up Mike Johnson and Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off' and after years we get it done. No, no, we're not a king, we're not a king at all,\" he added, referencing the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate Majority leader, respectively.",
      "Trump, on Tuesday, had threatened to use \"heavy force\" against \"any\" protesters at the military parade in the nation's capital; White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that \"of course\" the president supports peaceful protestors. Organizers of the No Kings protests have continuously emphasized they are not planning protests in Washington.",
      "Are there safety concerns surrounding the protests?",
      "Organizers have emphasized that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent, pointing to various trainings they've held this week about safety and deescalation.",
      "Levin said there were some concerns about outside agitators trying to disrupt protests, but he said people shouldn't feel \"as if we're going into battle. That's not what this is about. This is peaceful protest. People are going to have funny signs, people are going to be dancing, people are going to be chanting, people are going to be expressing their First Amendment rights.\"",
      "At least two states, Texas and Missouri, have said they are calling up the National Guard in their states as a precaution against the potential for any violence at protests on Saturday. The governors of both states affirmed that peaceful protests are legal.",
      "What comes next?",
      "The events on Saturday are not meant to be the be-all end-all of the groups' efforts to protest the Trump administration, Levin said.",
      "\"I think sometimes folks think a protest has to be everything. It's got to solve all your problems ... We need persistent, peaceful, people-powered organizing them on the ground in blue states, red states and purple states that allow people to push back against the escalating overreach from this administration,\" Levin said.",

    "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hawley-effort-expand-nuclear-waste-compensation-program-included/story?id=122812728",
    "published": "Fri, 13 Jun 2025 10:53:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The program will allow for compensation for exposure to toxic waste.",
    "story": [
      "The program will allow for compensation for exposure to toxic waste.",
      "For years, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley has been the face of a fight in Congress to reauthorize and expand access to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA), which provides compensation to individuals exposed to nuclear waste. Now, Hawley has announced a breakthrough: reauthorization and expansion of the program in the Senate's version of the \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "If the Senate's version of the bill is finally adopted, it will include in it the largest expansion of the program since its inception in 1990, allowing individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky and Alaska, as well as the already-qualified \"downwinders\" exposed to nuclear radiation from the testing of the atomic bomb, to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste.",
      "In an exclusive phone interview with ABC News Thursday night, Hawley called the inclusion of the RECA provisions in the Senate's version of the megabill advancing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda a \"huge step forward\" in the fight to secure compensation for individuals affected by nuclear exposure.",
      "\"This will be, if we can get the Big Beautiful Bill passed, this will be a huge huge victory,\" the Missouri Republican said during the phone call.",
      "The Senate is still working through the larger contours of the package which is expected to include an extension of the Trump 2017 Tax cuts and more funding for defense and border security. The bill is also expected to make changes to a number of programs, including SNAP and Medicaid, in order to cut costs.",
      "Hawley has been outspoken about concerns that the bill could limit Medicaid access for certain individuals and affect funding for rural hospitals. He's conditioned his support on changes to the Medicaid provisions in the House-passed bill.",
      "The Senate's Medicaid provisions have not yet been made available.",
      "The proposed reauthorization of RECA will be included in the Senate Judiciary Committee's portion of the reconciliation package. In addition to expansion and reauthorization, the proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers who worked in the mines from 1971-1990 to be eligible for benefits under the bill.",
      "\"There will be more to do,\" Hawley said. \"But this is a very very significant expansion.\"",
      "Hawley has been engaged in attempting to reauthorize RECA for several years. Some of his constituents in St. Louis are affected by nuclear waste from the Manhattan Project that is currently stored in the West Lake Landfill in Bridgeton, Missouri.",
      "One of those constituents is Dawn Chapman, who lives within miles of the West Lake Landfill and whose son and husband both suffer from autoimmune diseases as a result of exposure to the toxic waste near their home. Chapman has been to Capitol Hill several times over the last few years to advocate for families like hers.",
      "\"Tonight, we know we are not alone,\" Chapman told ABC News Thursday. \"With the help of Sen. Hawley and our community members as well as our other bipartisan REA family, we have been able to turn the lights back on, and make RECA bigger to cover more communities.\"",
      "For those affected by nuclear exposure, Hawley said he hopes this moment shows that the country is standing beside them.",
      "\"I think it really is an incredible sign that the country is with them,\" Hawley said. \"I think now this is a measure of vindication. It is a measure of appreciation.\"",
      "The Senate has twice passed an expansion and reauthorization of RECA with bipartisan support, but the bill has failed to gain traction in the House, in part due to concerns about the very high price tag originally estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. That price tag has been refuted by proponents of the bill, and they've taken steps to modify it to lower the cost.",
      "With further review and with programs set to sunset in 2028, the price tag should, Hawley said, fit well within the funds allocated to the Judiciary Committee to craft their portion of the reconciliation package. The CBO has not yet scored this portion of the package.",
      "The Senate will still need to maneuver these provisions through the Senate's procedural rules test as well as the finnicky Senate GOP conference, but Hawley said Majority Leader John Thune has been an ally in including the RECA language in the package. Thune's support could be critical to keeping the language in the bill.",
      "\"It would not be in this mark were it not for him and his commitment to putting it into reconciliation. He has been a terrific partner,\" Hawley said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has also conveyed that he \"wants to pass the RECA bill,\" Hawley said. Inclusion in the bill would make it difficult for House Republicans to reject RECA provisions, given that the package is massive and includes many other GOP priorities.",
      "Hawley said he has spoken with Trump about the move to include this legislation in the tax and immigration bill.",
      "\"He's been very involved in everything, and he and I have talked about the RECA program before on many occasions, we are glad for his involvement in all of this,\" Hawley said of his conversations with Trump.",

      "The senator claimed he did not barge into the news conference, as alleged by Noem, but rather he was in the federal building for an approved scheduled briefing with representatives of the Northern Command. He said the meeting was delayed by Noem's news conference, where she discussed the use of the National Guard in the city.",

Padilla was wearing a navy blue polo shirt that had the U.S. Senate logo under a navy blue jacket. He said he was not wearing a Senate pin at the time of the incident.",
      "Padilla was not detained or arrested and he and Noem had a private conversation for \"10-15 minutes\" after the incident, according to both the senator and the secretary.",

      "Sen. Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday evening that he had spoken with Padilla and the Senate Sergeant At Arms and had attempted to reach Noem and said he was gathering facts.",
      "\"We want to get the full scope of what happened and do what we would do in any incident like this involving a senator, that is, try to gather all of the relevant information,\" he said.",
      "When asked if he thought what occurred was appropriate based on what he had so far seen, Thune said, \"That's all I've got to say.\"",

    "summary": "As Washington prepares to celebrate the 250th birthday of the Army on Saturday, lawmakers are speaking out on what could be an astronomical cost for the parade.",
    "story": [
      "The Army has allocated between $25 million and $45 million for the parade.",
      "Congressional Democrats and at least one high-profile Republican are slamming the multimillion-dollar cost of the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Saturday that President Donald Trump has long sought to celebrate the military.",
      "Trump has said the cost -- projected to be as much as $45 million for the Army alone, not counting security and other expenses -- will be \"peanuts compared to the value of doing it.\"",
      "However, his critics argue the money could be better spent elsewhere.",
      "\"If it was really about celebrating military families, we could put $30 million toward helping them offset the cost of their child care, food assistance and tuition,\" Sen. Tammy Duckworth said on X. \"But it isn't. Trump is throwing himself a $30 million birthday parade just to stroke his own ego.\"",
      "The Army said it has accounted for spending between $25 million and $45 million on the parade, which will include 6,700 troops and dozens of tanks, military fighting vehicles and aircraft staged on or near the National Mall.",
      "\"Money should be put in medical defense research instead of wasted on some pomp and circumstance for the president,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday. \"This is not consistent with what the men and women in uniform deserve.\"",
      "Saturday's parade also falls on Trump's 79th birthday, and when it ends near the White House, the Army's Golden Knights parachute team will present him with an American flag, after which he'll administer the constitutional oath to Army enlistees.",
      "\"We all like to enjoy a nice birthday party,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., posted on X. \"But most of us don't celebrate with a $45 million taxpayer-funded military parade.",
      "\"Save taxpayer money. Have a birthday cake and blow out a few candles,\" he said. \"Don't shut down the capital and roll out 60-ton tanks through the streets.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't have done it,\" Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul said. \"We were always different than, you know, the images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea. We were proud not to be that.\"",
      "Some Democrats echoed that criticism.",
      "\"It's outrageous,\" Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Ariz., said. \"This is something that would happen in North Korea, not the United States of America. Donald Trump thinks he's a king. He's not. He was elected as president of the United States, and he should act as such.\"",
      "Army spokesman Steve Warren defended the parade, saying, \"It is a lot of money, but I think that amount of money is dwarfed by 250 years of service and sacrifice that American soldiers have given this country.",
      "\"We're looking at this as an opportunity to really strengthen the connection between America and her Army,\" he added. \"So, yeah, it's a lot of money, but it pales in comparison to what we're selling.\"",
      "The White House this week also requested a flyover by the Air Force Thunderbirds.",
      "When asked Thursday what he hopes the public will remember about the parade, Trump said, \"How great our country is, very simple, and how strong our military is.\"",
      "\"We have the strongest military in the world,\" he added.",
      "The White House has not responded to requests for a total cost estimate that would include money spent on security and other arrangements.",
      "Several Republicans say they're skipping the parade due to prior commitments, including House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said she would attend and defended the display.",
      "\"Washington D.C. is the safest it's ever been!!\" she wrote. \"I wish our great military men and women could just stay here. I am so excited for the parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of our United States Army!!\"",
      "Protests of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown are planned across the country to counterprogram the parade, with the flagship \"No Kings\" protest occurring in Philadelphia. Nine small protests are also expected in Washington, according to the Secret Service and local officials. Trump has warned protesters will be met with \"heavy force.\"",
      "On Thursday, he disputed the characterization of him as a king. \"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff approved,\" he said, adding, \"No, no, we're not a king. We're not a king at all.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 16:34:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The recent raft of pardons handed out by President Trump has shortchanged fraud victims of millions of dollars in restitution that's still owed to them, attorneys say.",
    "story": [
      "\"The victims are the losers\" in this situation, an ex-U.S. pardon attorney says.",
      "In April, fresh off a presidential pardon that sprung him from prison, convicted fraudster Jason Galanis embarked on a new and audacious legal fight: an attempt to recover money that he had already paid back his victims.",
      "As part of his 2017 sentence, a federal judge ordered Galanis to pay more than $80 million in restitution for his various fraudulent schemes. But when President Donald Trump commuted Galanis' 189-month prison sentence in March as part of a flurry of pardons, Galanis' pardon warrant stipulated that \"no further fines [and] restitution\" should be collected.",
      "Days later, Galanis asked a federal judge to order the government to return some $2 million he had already paid, arguing that because the government had not yet released those funds to his victims, Galanis was entitled to them.",
      "\"Put very simply, the funds were taken for a particular purpose,\" attorneys for Galanis wrote last month in a letter to the judge. \"It is indisputable that that purpose no longer exists and thus ... the funds must be returned.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel, the judge overseeing Galanis' case, ruled Wednesday that he cannot recoup the $2 million. But some legal experts say Galanis' bid to retrieve those restitution funds reflects a broader symptom of what they say is Trump's unprecedented use of executive pardon powers.",
      "\"Typically, the Department of Justice does not recommend a pardon in cases in which the candidate owes a significant amount of restitution ... so these pardons that wipe out large financial obligations are very unusual in their effect,\" former U.S. pardon attorney Liz Oyer, who is not involved in the case, told ABC News.",
      "By Oyer's count, the recipients of Trump's second-term clemency cumulatively owed more than $1 billion in restitution -- money intended for the victims of fraudulent schemes. Instead, according to Oyer, \"victims are just out all of the money that they expected to be repaid as part of restitution, due to the pardons.\"",
      "\"The victims are the losers,\" Oyer said. \"Those are people who have a legal entitlement under federal law to be repaid their losses ... and the president is overriding that legal requirement ... to the great detriment of people who, in some cases, have lost their life savings.\"",
      "Those victims include a Native American tribe, an Arizona teachers' pension fund, and even a Republican governor.",
      "In Galanis' case, prosecutors wrote that the victims of his scheme include \"pension funds held for the benefit of, among others, transit workers, longshoremen, housing authority workers, and city employees.\"",
      "The majority of the victims are shareholders in companies like Nikola, whose disgraced founder and chief executive, Trevor Milton, was sentenced to four years in prison for lying about the viability of his electric vehicle technology.",
      "Prosecutors had asked a federal judge to order Milton to pay more than $600 million in restitution, which they said was \"the approximate amount of damages to investors in this case.\" Milton was pardoned before a judge had a chance to approve that figure, but experts said judges typically hew closely to prosecutors' calculations.",
      "Asked in a local news interview in March whether he would repay the victims of his fraudulent scheme, Milton said he \"wouldn't pay them back,\" but offered an alternative: \"I've got a few big ventures I'm working on right now, I'd definitely be open to helping those people in the future.\"",
      "\"I'm not heartless,\" he added. \"As a matter of fact, I feel for these people probably more than most.\"",
      "Pardon recipients who owed outstanding restitution at the time they were pardoned include Carlos Watson, the founder and CEO of Ozy Media who pleaded guilty to fraud charges and owed nearly $37 million in restitution, and Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder serving life in prison for an online drug scheme, who was ordered to pay almost $184 million in restitution.",
      "Other pardon recipients include Todd and Julie Chrisley, the reality television celebrities sentenced to more than seven years in prison for tax evasion and bank fraud, whose attorney suggested to TMZ that they may seek to recoup some of the $17 million in restitution that they'd already begun to pay.",
      "Former Las Vegas councilwoman Michele Fiore, who spent some $70,000 in donations to a slain police officer fund on personal expenses, including cosmetic surgery, was also pardoned. Trump issued Fiore's pardon before her sentencing, but experts say restitution generally aligns with the cost of the purported fraud scheme.",
      "Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a fellow Republican, testified at trial that he had donated to Fiore's fund and was a victim of her fraud. Another victim, Harry Mohney, a strip club owner who donated $2,000 to the fund, said he was \"distressed\" to learn that Fiore would not have to pay restitution.",
      "\"It certainly pisses me off to a great extent,\" Mohney told ABC News. \"It's unfair that she never has to repay the people she got the money from under false pretenses, but there's nothing I can do about that.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said that Trump is \"using his pardon power to offer people second chances at life.\"",
      "\"The Founding Fathers gave the President the pardon power to provide mercy where the President alone deems it necessary,\" Fields said.",
      "Legal experts ABC News spoke with said it's unclear to what extent victims could seek to claim the restitution they're still owed following Trump's pardons. One option would be to file a civil lawsuit to reclaim damages, but that can be a lengthy and expensive proposition.",
      "\"Restitution makes it so easy -- you don't have to pay a lawyer, you don't have to go to court,\" said Mark Osler, an expert on clemency at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. \"You can see why that would be a victim's first choice for how to be made whole.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with ABC News struggled to cite past examples of fraudsters who were granted clemency prior to fulfilling their restitution obligations. Oyer said Trump's commutation of restitution payments is without precedent.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Oyer said.",
      "The Justice Department, on its website, cautions fraud victims seeking restitution that \"the chance of full recovery is very low,\" and that \"while defendants may make partial payments toward the full restitution owed, it is rare that defendants are able to fully pay the entire restitution amount owed.\"",
      "Nevertheless, experts say that regardless of whether victims ever completely recoup their lost money, restitution obligations remain an important mechanism in the criminal justice system.",
      "\"One of the purposes of restitution, even if it's never fully repaid, is to ensure that the perpetrator of the crime cannot enrich themselves first, while they still owe money to victims,\" Oyer explained. \"And that's exactly what [Trump's] pardons facilitate happening.\"",

    "story": [
      "Congress faces a July 4 deadline to pass the megabill.",
      "The Senate has long been signaling that changes to the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" are coming, and as Congress barrels toward President Donald Trump's July 4 deadline, the contours of those changes are beginning to take shape.",
      "Senators met for over two hours on Wednesday to hear updates from committee chairs about proposed changes to certain portions of the House-approved package. Very few details are locked in, but senators received an overview of the general direction the provisions in the bill are taking.",
      "\"Imagine a jigsaw puzzle with 3,000 pieces and no picture. So that's what we're trying to put together,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the bill would rein in the cost of government and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path to a degree \"I think a lot of people never thought was possible.\"",
      "\"This will be the biggest spending reduction, mandatory spending, in history, so we are working to that end,\" Thune said on \"The Will Cain Show.\"",
      "Here's a look at how some of the major provisions of this bill are taking shape.",
      "SNAP",
      "Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., the chairman of the Senate agriculture committee, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, signaled there would be changes in the bill to lessen the burden on the states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal.",
      "Boozman said that unlike the House bill that would require states to share 5% of the cost of SNAP, the Senate proposal does away with the cost-share, though states with high error rates would still have an obligation to share costs.",
      "Work requirements for families of young children to qualify for SNAP would also change, now being implemented for families with children over 10 instead of children over 7.",
      "The changes to the House proposal would mean that the savings from SNAP changes implemented in the bill are about $20 billion less than the House's version, per Boozman.",
      "SALT",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave House centrists a win by upping the cap on state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000. Senators left Wednesday's meeting suggesting they plan to lower that cap.",
      "The Senate has not coalesced around a new cap, but senators have signaled the number will be well beneath $40,000.",
      "\"There was never a number specially discussed other than that the House is 40, and it's a lot. No surprise that there's an interest in reducing it,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.",
      "\"It's likely we will do less, and that's how specific it got,\" Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., echoed.",
      "From the Senate GOP's calculus, lowering the SALT cap is an easy win since it helps to cut costs from the bill and there are virtually no Senate Republicans from blue states with especially high state and local taxes.",
      "But slashing the SALT cap could make for a perilous path forward in the House, where a number of centrist Republicans have threatened to withhold support if the Senate touches the cap.",
      "\"There isn't much interest in the Senate in going back on SALT,\" Thune said during a Fox News interview. \"Having said that, they need the votes in the House. We understand that, and we are looking at ways that we can adjust and dial those provisions.\"",
      "Border funding",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is one of the Senate's biggest fiscal hawks and, as such, one of the bill's biggest naysayers. He's also the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and responsible for charting a path forward on the border provisions in the package.",
      "Paul told reporters he advocated lowering the amount of money allocated for border security.",
      "\"I presented my ideas that we shouldn't immediately accept the $150 billion for border security, that we should look at how much a wall costs to build,\" Paul said.",
      "Paul said a number of his colleagues came along to his way of thinking but that he didn't win over everyone in the room.",
      "\"Maybe we can find some savings there, but Sen. Paul's numbers are just not realistic,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Medicaid",
      "Medicaid changes remain somewhat of an open question.",
      "Thune said he is \"working on\" getting Republicans on the same page about Medicaid cuts, especially with members such as Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who made the issue their line in the sand when it comes to supporting the bill.",
      "\"The House made a good effort, trying to pare back the use of provider taxes and the way they have been gamed and used in the past,\" Thune said, suggesting that provider tax credits have been manipulated by residents of blue states.",
      "\"And the Senate is trying to build upon that, but obviously it is an issue that we need to have 51 votes for in the Senate, they need to keep 418 in the House,\" he said, suggesting the Senate could step over Hawley's stipulations. \"At the end of the day, this is a program that is right for reform.",
      "\"The things we are going to do are going to strengthen it and improve it and make it available for whom it was intended,\" Thune concluded. \"It shouldn't be available for illegal immigrants. There are people who are ineligible, able-bodied males, who are working age -- there ought to be a work requirement attached to it.\"",
      "Energy tax credits",
      "Multiple senators have signaled they plan to toy with transferability of expiration dates of certain Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits.",
      "\"There are certain newer tools where businesses have made large capital investments where we hopefully can extend the runway or the landing strip a little bit for them,\" Cramer said. \"It comes down to things, like when the credit kicks in versus when it runs out, when it expires.\"",

      "The swell of optimism ended six straight months of worsening attitudes.",
      "Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, indicating a swell of optimism as President Donald Trump rolled back some tariffs in recent weeks.",
      "The resurgence of shopper attitudes ended six consecutive months of worsening sentiment, University of Michigan survey data on Friday showed. Before the uptick, consumer sentiment had fallen near its lowest level since a bout of inflation three years ago.",
      "Year-ahead inflation expectations, meanwhile, dropped sharply from 6.6% last month to 5.1% in June, the data showed. The anticipated inflation level would still mark a major increase from the current year-over-year inflation of 2.4%.",
      "The improvement of sentiment was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, wealth, political party and geographic region, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said in a statement.",
      "In recent weeks, Trump has dialed back some of his steepest tariffs, easing the costs imposed upon importers. Such companies typically pass along a share of the higher tax burden in the form of price hikes.",
      "A trade agreement between the U.S. and China slashed tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest economies and triggered a surge in the stock market. Within days, Wall Street firms softened their forecasts of a downturn.",
      "The U.S.-China accord came weeks after the White House paused a large swath of Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs targeting dozens of countries. Trump also eased sector-specific tariffs targeting autos and rolled back duties on some goods from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Still, an across-the-board 10% tariff applies to nearly all imports, except for semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and some other items. Those tariffs stand in legal limbo, however, after a pair of federal court rulings late last month.",
      "Tariffs remain in place for steel, aluminum and autos, as well as some goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "Fresh inflation data this week showed a slight acceleration of price increases, but inflation remains near its lowest level since 2021. So far, the economy has defied fears of price hikes, instead giving way to a cooldown of inflation over the months since Trump took office.",
      "Warning signs point to the possibility of elevated prices over the coming months, however.",
      "Nationwide retailers like Walmart and Best Buy have voiced alarm about the possibility they may raise prices as a result of the levies.",
      "The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, said this month it expects U.S. inflation to reach 4% by the end of 2025, which would mark a sharp increase from current levels.",
      "Federal Chair Jerome Powell, in recent months, has warned about the possibility that tariffs may cause what economists call \"stagflation,\" which is when inflation rises and the economy slows.",
      "Stagflation could put the central bank in a difficult position. If the Fed were to raise interest rates, it could help ease inflation, but it may risk an economic downturn. If the Fed were to cut rates in an effort to spur economic growth, the move could unleash faster price increases.",
      "For now, the Fed appears willing to take a wait-and-see approach. At its last meeting, in May, the Fed opted to hold interest rates steady for the second consecutive time.",
      "The Fed will announce its next rate decision on June 18. Investors peg the chances of a decision to leave rates unchanged at 99.9%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, a measure of market sentiment.",

      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- More than 1.15 million power banks are under recall across the U.S. after some fires and explosions were reported by consumers.",
      "According to a Thursday notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, electronics maker Anker Innovations is recalling certain \u201cPowerCore 10000\u201d power banks because the lithium-ion battery inside can overheat.",
      "An overheating battery can lead to \u201cmelting of plastic components, smoke, and fire hazards,\u201d Anker wrote in an accompanying announcement. The company added that it was conducting this recall \"out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety of our customers.\"",

      "The recalled \u201cPowerCore 10000\u201d power banks have a model number of A1263. They were sold online at Anker's website \u2014 as well as Amazon, eBay and Newegg \u2014 between June 2016 and December 2022 for about $27 across the U.S., per the recall notice.",
      "Consumers in possession these now-recalled chargers are urged to stop using them immediately \u2014 and contact Anker for a free replacement.",

      "Both the CPSC and Anker note that these power banks should not be thrown directly in the trash or general recycling streams. Due to fire risks, recalled lithium-ion batteries must be disposed of differently than other batteries \u2014 so it's important to check local guidance.",

      "In a letter to U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey, the lawyers said Khalil has satisfied all the court\u2019s requirements, including posting a $1 bond, while the lawyers for the government missed a 9:30 a.m. deadline the judge set Wednesday.",

      "\u201cThe deadline has come and gone and Mahmoud Khalil must be released immediately,\u201d his lawyers said in a statement provided by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is among the groups representing him. \u201cAnything further is an attempt to prolong his unconstitutional, arbitrary, and cruel detention.\u201d",

      "A Tennessee judge is scheduled to hear arguments about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released from jail pending the outcome of a federal trial on human smuggling charges",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee judge is scheduled to hear arguments Friday about whether Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released from jail pending the outcome of a trial on human smuggling charges.",
      "In a motion asking U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to order Abrego Garcia detained, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire described him as both a danger to the community and a flight risk. Abrego Garcia's attorneys disagree. They point out that he was already wrongly detained in a notorious Salvadoran prison thanks to government error, and argue that due process and \u201cbasic fairness\u201d require him to be set free.",
      "Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living in the United States for more than a decade before he was wrongfully deported in March. The expulsion violated a 2019 U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he likely faced gang persecution there.",
      "His case quickly became a rallying point for opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda. While the Trump administration described the mistaken removal as \u201can administrative error,\u201d officials have continued to justify it by insisting that Abrego Garcia was a member of the El Salvadoran gang MS-13. His wife and attorneys have denied the allegations, saying he is simply a construction worker and family man.",
      "The motion for detention pretrial accuses Abrego Garcia of trafficking people, drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims. It states that human smuggling was Abrego Garcia\u2019s actual job, not construction. It even accuses him of taking part in a murder in El Salvador. However, none of those allegations are part of the charges against him, and at Abrego Garcia\u2019s initial appearance June 6, Judge Holmes warned prosecutors that she can not detain someone based solely on allegations.",
      "One of Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys last week called the claims \u201cpreposterous,\u201d characterizing them as a desperate attempt by the Trump administration to justify the mistaken deportation three months after the fact.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,\u201d private attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said last week.",
      "In a Wednesday court filing, Abrego Garcia's public defenders argued the government is not even entitled to a detention hearing \u2014 much less actual detention \u2014 because the charges against their client are not serious enough.",
      "Although the maximum sentence for smuggling one person is 10 years, and Abrego Garcia is accused of transporting hundreds of people over nearly a decade, his defense attorneys point out that there is no minimum sentence. The average sentence for human smuggling in 2024 was just 15 months, according to court filings.",
      "Ohio State University law professor C\u00e9sar Cuauht\u00e9moc Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said he would not be surprised if the judge releases Abrego Garcia because he\u2019s too well-known to pose a flight risk.",
      "\u201cThe thought that this is somebody who can disappear or who might violate the law without anyone noticing seems farfetched,\u201d Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.",
      "But even if Abrego Garcia is released on the criminal charges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement might immediately move to detain and deport him, Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said.",
      "Most people in ICE custody who are facing criminal charges are deported, he said, and the idea that ICE would take Abrego Garcia to his court proceedings in Tennessee is \u201cnext to unheard of.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an unusual situation in that most criminal defendants are not household names in the Oval Office,\u201d Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cI would hope the folks in the Trump administration have thought this through.\u201d",
      "The decision to charge Abrego Garcia criminally prompted the resignation of Ben Schrader, who was chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. He posted about his departure on social media on the day of the indictment, writing, \u201cIt has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I\u2019ve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.\u201d",
      "He did not directly address the indictment and declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. However, a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter confirmed the connection.",
      "Although Abrego Garcia lives in Maryland, he is being charged in Tennessee based on a May 2022 traffic stop for speeding in the state. The Tennessee Highway Patrol body camera video of the encounter that was released to the public last month shows a calm exchange between officers and Abrego Garcia. It also shows the officers discussing among themselves their suspicions of human smuggling before sending him on his way. One of the officers says, \u201cHe\u2019s hauling these people for money.\u201d Another says Abrego Garcia had $1,400 in an envelope.",
      "Abrego Garcia was not charged with any offense at the traffic stop. Attorney Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement after the video's release that he saw no evidence of a crime in the footage.",
      "Meanwhile, the lawsuit over Abrego Garcia\u2019s mistaken deportation isn\u2019t over. Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys have asked a federal judge in Maryland to impose fines against the administration for contempt, arguing that it flagrantly ignored court orders forseveral weeks to return him. The Trump administration said it will ask the judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that it followed the judge\u2019s order to return him to the U.S.",

      "Lawyers in the second murder trial of Karen Read are set to give their closing arguments after weeks of testimony",
      "Lawyers in the murder trial of Karen Read are set to give their closing arguments Friday after weeks of testimony in a highly divisive case in which the prosecution\u2019s theory of jaded love turned deadly is countered by a defense claim that a cast of tight-knit Boston area law enforcement killed a fellow police officer.",
      "Read, 45, is accused of fatally striking her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O\u2019Keefe, 46, with her SUV and leaving him to die in the snow outside a house party where other local police and a federal agent were closing out a night of drinking in 2022. She\u2019s charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene in Canton, outside Boston.",
      "Read\u2019s defense has suggested she was the victim of a wide-ranging conspiracy that included planting evidence and using her as a convenient scapegoat for her boyfriend\u2019s death.",
      "The first Read trial ended July 1 in a mistrial due to a hung jury, and several jurors came out after to say that the panel had unanimously agreed that Read was not guilty of the most serious charge of second-degree murder.",
      "The state's case was led by special prosecutor Hank Brennan, who called fewer witnesses than prosecutor Adam Lally, who ran the first trial against Read.",
      "Brennan has referenced Read\u2019s statement about the possibility that she backed into O\u2019Keefe, which the defense has pointed out came not from police reports but from a voluntary interview she did for a documentary series. In the television interview, Read said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I hit him,\u201d but acknowledged she could have \u201cclipped him.\u201d",
      "In the first trial, the state called Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in the case. Proctor would later be fired after a disciplinary board found he sent sexist and crude text messages about Read. Proctor was asked to read the texts aloud in court during the first trial, but in the second, the prosecution relied on others to read the offensive comments.",
      "The defense called one of Proctor's friends to read more texts that suggested he had focused on Read early in the investigation. During the first trial, Proctor acknowledged being friends with Kevin Albert, a Canton police officer who is the brother of the owner of the home where the party was held.",
      "Prosecutors this time focused on evidence from the scene, and tried to make the point that broken pieces of Read\u2019s taillight show she struck O\u2019Keefe with her vehicle. The defense has argued that the taillight was actually damaged when Read was backing out of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s house and hit his car. They have suggested Proctor and others could have colluded to plant the pieces of broken plastic near O'Keefe's body after they took the vehicle back to the police department.",
      "Experts called by the prosecutors testified that data on O'Keefe's phone matched with it being located near a flagpole on the lawn, near the street, where his body was found. There was also no phone activity after that and the phone's battery temperature dropped considerably, the specialist said. Another specialist used GPS and phone data to place Read's vehicle at the scene around the same time.",
      "Another expert testified that Read\u2019s vehicle reversed more than 50 feet (15 meters) at about 23 mph (37 kph).",
      "Andre Porto, a forensic scientist who works in the DNA unit of the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, detailed various items he tested, including the broken rear taillight and pieces of a broken cocktail glass found in the yard. Only O\u2019Keefe was a likely match for both. A hair found on Read\u2019s vehicle was a match for O\u2019Keefe. Traces of DNA from three people, O\u2019Keefe and two unknown individuals, were on the outside of Read\u2019s taillight and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s clothing, Porto said.",
      "Prosecutors called a neurosurgeon who testified that O\u2019Keefe suffered a \u201cclassic blunt trauma injury\u201d associated with falling backward and hitting his head. The broken cocktail glass found at the scene is another key piece of evidence, prosecutors have said, because O\u2019Keefe was holding it when Read dropped him off.",
      "The prosecution pointed out that Read and O'Keefe were fighting. Voicemails recovered from Read's phone in which she said, \u201cI (expletive) hate you,\u201d to O'Keefe were played in court. That voicemail would have arrived while he was lying in the snow.",
      "Read\u2019s defense team has cast doubt on the state\u2019s case by suggesting Read was framed.",
      "The defense has painted a picture of a deceitful web of people in O'Keefe's social network who saw Read as a scapegoat for his death. The network includes federal agent Brian Higgins, who exchanged flirtatious text messages with Read, leading the defense to question if that led to a fatal confrontation. Higgins was present at the party on the night of O'Keefe's death.",
      "Defense attorneys presented a different view of how Read's taillight was cracked. They have attempted to show, via witnesses, surveillance video and photographs, that Read may have damaged her taillight the morning after O'Keefe's death when she backed out of his driveway and bumped his car with her own.",
      "Nicholas Barros, a police officer at a department where Read's car was impounded, testified that he saw only a small crack in Read's taillight when the car first arrived. The defense has pointed out that the taillight later looked much more damaged, arguing it could have been tampered with.",
      "A crash expert who testified for the defense said, based on every test he performed, the damage to Read\u2019s taillight and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s clothing was inconsistent with her SUV striking an arm or body at the speed described by the prosecution.",
      "The defense has also questioned why investigators never entered the home where the party took place, although witnesses from the scene and prosecutors have said O'Keefe never went inside.",
      "Dr. Elizabeth Laposata, a former medical examiner called by the defense, said O'Keefe's injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma to the back of the head, but that his eye wounds were not consistent with being hit by the rear of Read\u2019s SUV. She testified she did not think O'Keefe was hit by the SUV at all.",
      "The defense also questioned Jennifer McCabe, who was at the house party and is the sister-in-law of the host, retired Boston police officer Brian Albert. McCabe made a misspelled web search, \u201chos long to die in cold,\u201d after O'Keefe's death.",
      "The timing of the search has been in question. The defense argued that McCabe made the search at about 2:30 a.m. and helped cover for the real killer. The prosecution claims she searched after O'Keefe's body was found later in the morning.",
      "The defense called into question the actions of others who were at the party the night O'Keefe died. The party happened at the home of Albert, and after O'Keefe's death, the Alberts rehomed their dog Chloe \u2014 who the defense claims bit O'Keefe \u2014 and refurbished their basement before selling their home at a loss.",
      "Dr. Marie Russell, a retired emergency medicine physician, testified that the wounds on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arms were the result of a dog attack, injuries the prosecution attributes to being struck by Read's vehicle.",
      "The judge in the case did not allow medical examiner Laposata to testify specifically about potential dog bite wounds, but did allow her to testify that some of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm injuries were consistent with an animal bite, not with wounds from a broken taillight.",
      "The defense introduced phone records that showed unanswered calls between Albert and Higgins in the early morning hours after O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. They both later destroyed their phones, with Higgins testifying in the first trial that he obliterated his phone's SIM card and disposed of it at a military base. The defense also introduced records from McCabe that showed she repeatedly called O'Keefe after midnight, calls she described as \u201cbutt dials.\u201d",

      "A South Carolina man sent to death row twice for separate murders is scheduled to die by lethal injection in the state\u2019s sixth execution in nine months",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A South Carolina man sent to death row twice for separate murders is scheduled to die Friday by lethal injection in the state's sixth execution in nine months.",
      "Stephen Stanko, 57, is being killed for shooting a friend and then cleaning out his bank account in Horry County in 2005. Hours earlier Stanko killed his live-in girlfriend, strangling her as he raped her teenage daughter in the woman's home in neighboring Georgetown County. He slit the teen's throat but she survived. Stanko also ended up on death row for that crime.",
      "Stanko was leaning toward dying by South Carolina's new firing squad, like two inmates before him. But after autopsy results from the last inmate killed by that method showed the bullets from the three volunteers nearly missed his heart, Stanko went with lethal injection.",
      "Stanko is the last of four executions scheduled around the country this week. Florida and Alabama each put an inmate to death on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Oklahoma executed a man transferred from federal to state custody to allow his death.",
      "There are a couple of long-shot efforts to spare his life. Stanko can appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge refused this week to stop his execution. Stanko's lawyers said the state isn't carrying out lethal injection properly after autopsy results found fluid in the lungs of other inmates killed that way.",
      "Or South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster could offer clemency. That decision won't be made until a phone call prison officials make to the governor minutes before every execution. Stanko's execution is set to start at 6 p.m. at a Columbia prison.",
      "A governor has not spared a death row inmate's life in the previous 48 executions since South Carolina reinstated the death penalty about 50 years ago.",
      "Stanko will be strapped to a gurney in the state's death chamber. An IV line, placed before witnesses enter the room, will stretch into a wall behind him.",
      "He will be given at least one massive dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. In previous South Carolina executions, prison officials have given inmates a second dose of the drug after 10 minutes when their hearts have shown sporadic electrical impulses because the organ is the last to use the body\u2019s stored oxygen.",
      "Lawyers for Stanko said the procedure shows inmates suffer. But a federal judge pointed out Wednesday that witnesses to all three South Carolina lethal injection deaths in the past nine months said the inmates took several breaths, some that sounded like snores, then stopped breathing and lost consciousness within one to two minutes.",
      "Stanko is being executed for killing his 74-year-old friend Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s home in April 2005 after lying about his father dying and then shot Turner twice while using a pillow as a silencer, authorities said.",
      "Stanko stole Turner\u2019s truck, cleaned out his bank account and then spent the next few days in Augusta, Georgia, where he told people in town for the Masters Tournament that he owned several Hooters restaurants. He stayed with a woman who took him to church. She then called police once she saw his photo and that he was wanted, police said.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials.",
      "\u201cStephen Stanko is just plain evil. He has, in his core, down deep inside, something that makes him evil. He\u2019s a bad man, he knows it, and he likes it. He doesn\u2019t turn away from it. He will hide it. He\u2019s very, very, very good at hiding it, but you cannot equate evil with insanity,\u201d then-prosecutor Greg Hembree said in his closing statement at one of Stanko\u2019s trials.",
      "Hembree later became a state senator and was the chief sponsor of the 2021 law allowing South Carolina to use a firing squad.",

      "Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court for 10 convictions on bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud charges",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Michael Madigan\u2019s stunning political collapse is expected to culminate Friday when the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history is sentenced on federal bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud convictions tied to a scheme to push legislation in exchange for jobs and contracts for his associates.",
      "The former Illinois House speaker was convicted in February on 10 of 23 counts in a remarkable corruption trial that lasted four months. The case churned through 60 witnesses and mountains of documents, photographs and taped conversations.",
      "Madigan will appear in U.S. District Court Friday in Chicago, where Judge John Robert Blakey will determine his sentence.",
      "Federal prosecutors are seeking a 12 1/2-year prison term. Madigan\u2019s attorneys are seeking probation, contending the government\u2019s sentence would \u201ccondemn an 83-year-old man to die behind bars for crimes that enriched him not one penny.\u201d",
      "During a legislative career that spanned a half-century, Madigan served nearly four decades as speaker, the longest on record for a U.S. legislator. Combined with more than 20 years as chairperson of the Illinois Democratic Party, he set much of the state\u2019s political agenda while handpicking candidates for political office. More often than not, he also controlled political mapmaking, drawing lines to favor his party.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors said, the Chicago Democrat built a private legal career that allowed him to amass a net worth of $40 million.",
      "Madigan was convicted on 10 counts of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and other charges for ensuring approval of legislation favorable to utility giant ComEd in exchange for kickbacks and jobs and contracts for loyalists, including a Chicago alderman seeking a paid job on a state board after retiring from government.",
      "The jury deadlocked on six counts, including an overarching racketeering conspiracy charge, and acquitted him on seven others.",
      "\u201cMadigan\u2019s criminal activity spanned nearly a decade and was particularly egregious because it involved efforts to enrich himself \u2014 both by maintaining his political power by securing do-nothing jobs for his political allies and by attempting to line his own pockets with legal business,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing. \u201cIn so doing, Madigan served his own personal interests and not the interests of Illinoisans.\u201d",
      "Defense lawyers called the government\u2019s recommended sentence \u201cdraconian\u201d and, given Madigan\u2019s age, a life sentence. They asked Blakey to consider the totality of Madigan\u2019s life and work and the need to care for his wife in requesting a sentence of five years\u2019 probation, with one year of home confinement, a requirement to perform community service and a \u201creasonable fine.\u201d",
      "In a video submitted to the court, Madigan\u2019s wife, Shirley, asks for a sentence of probation, explaining that Madigan is her caregiver and she would have to seek outside help if he is imprisoned. And, she says, \u201cI\u2019m a part of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some days I keep him going,\u201d Shirley Madigan says on the video. \u201cHe keeps me going sometimes, too, but I think that the impact that I have on him has been much, much larger.\u201d",
      "The court received more than 200 letters of support for Madigan, many from constituents, friends, leaders of nonprofits and other organizations that interact with the state. Some noted asking him for help just once. Most lauded him for dedication, integrity or a personal touch.",
      "\u201cMike Madigan is a good man who has selflessly done an exceptional amount of good for others,\u201d his lawyers wrote in a separate filing. \u201cHe is widely respected for his dedication to honesty and integrity.\u201d",
      "Tried alongside Madigan was his former legislative colleague and longtime confidant, Michael McClain. The jury couldn\u2019t reach a decision on any of the six counts against McClain. He was convicted, though, in a separate trial over the ComEd conspiracy last year.",

      "Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo has vetoed a bill that would have required voters in the swing state to show a photo ID at the polls",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo unexpectedly vetoed a bill on Thursday that would have required voters in the swing state to show a photo ID at the polls \u2014 a conservative priority across the country and something that has long been on the governor\u2019s legislative wish list.",
      "The move brings a dramatic end to one of the legislative session\u2019s most surprising outcomes: A bipartisan deal that combined the requirement for voter identification with a Democratic-backed measure to add more drop boxes for mail ballots that Lombardo had initially vetoed.",
      "The bill came together in the final days of the session and passed mere minutes before the Democratic-controlled Legislature adjourned just after midnight on June 3. Lombardo had been expected to sign it.",
      "In his veto message, Lombardo said he \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d supports voter ID laws but that he felt the bill fell short on addressing his concerns about ballots cast by mail, because such ballots could still be accepted \u201csolely on the basis of a signature match\" under the bill.",
      "Because it \u201cwould apply voter ID requirements unequally between in-person and mail ballot voters and fails to sufficiently guarantee ballot security, I cannot support it,\u201d he said.",
      "The voter ID requirements in the bill mirrored a ballot initiative known as Question 7 that Nevada voters overwhelmingly approved last November. But voters would have to pass it again in 2026 to amend the state constitution. The requirement would then be in place by 2028.",
      "Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, the Democrat who brokered the deal with Lombardo, said when he introduced the legislation that voters seemed poised to give the final approval, and that enacting a voter ID law would have given the state a head start on ensuring a smooth rollout before the next presidential election.",
      "In a scathing statement, Yeager called the governor's decision a \u201cbreach of trust,\" saying that he believes Lombardo gave in to pressure around him to veto the bill, designated Assembly Bill 499.",
      "\u201cLombardo was for AB499 before he was against it, encouraging all legislative Republicans to support it, which they did,\u201d Yeager said.",
      "Voting rights groups condemned the legislation, saying it would have made it harder for some people to vote, including low-income or unhoused voters, people with disabilities and older voters.",
      "Let Nevadans Vote, which describes itself as a nonpartisan coalition, said Thursday in a statement that the governor's veto only temporarily stops what it called \u201cthe misguided and ill-conceived implementation of voter ID in Nevada.\u201d",
      "\u201cCome 2026, Question 7 will still be on the ballot,\" the group said while describing voter ID requirements as \u201cstrict regimes\u201d that \u201cdecide who gets to exercise their constitutional right to vote and who cannot.\u201d",
      "Polls have shown that most Americans support voter ID laws, and that has been consistent over the years and across party lines. A 2024 Gallup poll found 84% of Americans were in favor of requirements for a photo ID at voting places, consistent with Gallup findings from 2022 and 2016. That includes about two-thirds of Democrats, according to the 2024 survey.",
      "Voters are either required or requested to show ID when voting in person in 36 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Not all states require photo ID, though. Some accept documents such as a bank statement, and some allow voters without ID to vote after signing an affidavit. A few states allow poll workers to vouch for voters without an ID.",
      "Lombardo on Thursday also vetoed a bill that would have allowed the swing state\u2019s nonpartisan voters to cast ballots in Republican or Democratic primary races.",
      "The bill sought to include the more than 855,000 voters registered as nonpartisans \u2014 the state's largest voting bloc \u2014 in the process of nominating major-party candidates for congressional races and statewide offices.",
      "A ballot initiative to open up primaries for all registered voters was rejected by voters last November. The sweeping measure, which also attempted to implement ranked choice voting, faced intense opposition from party leaders on both sides who said it was too broad and confusing.",

Most recently, under a new law in Tennessee, local officials who vote to adopt sanctuary policies could face up to six years in prison. Other states allow residents or the local attorney general to sue officials and state governments if they limit or refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "But threats of repercussions have gone beyond the creation of legislation. Most recently, as the National Guard was deployed to protests in Los Angeles, Tom Homan, the Trump administration's \u201c border czar,\" hinted that elected officials could face arrest if they interfere with agents on the ground.",

      "\u201cWe look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\u201d Hegseth responded.",
      "Time and again, lawmakers pressed Hegseth to answer questions he has avoided for months, including during the two previous days of hearings on Capitol Hill. And frustration boiled over.",
      "\"You\u2019re an embarrassment to this country. You\u2019re unfit to lead,\" Rep. Salud Carbajal snapped, the California Democrat's voice rising. \u201cYou should just get the hell out.\u201d",
      "Hegseth's use of two Signal chats to discuss plans for U.S. strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen with other U.S. leaders as well as members of his family prompted dizzying exchanges with lawmakers.",
      "He was pressed multiple times over whether or not he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.",
      "Hegseth argued that the classification markings of any information about those military operations could not be discussed with lawmakers.",
      "That became a quick trap, as Hegseth has asserted that nothing he posted \u2014 on strike times and munitions dropped in March \u2014 was classified. His questioner, Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, jumped on the disparity.",
      "\u201cYou can very well disclose whether or not it was classified,\u201d Moulton said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s not classified is that it was an incredible, successful mission,\u201d Hegseth responded.",
      "A Pentagon watchdog report on his Signal use is expected soon.",
      "Moulton asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general finds that he placed classified information on Signal, a commercially available app.",
      "Hegseth would not directly say, only noting that he serves \u201cat the pleasure of the president.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has said multiple times that he wants to take control of the strategic, mineral-rich island nation of Greenland, long a U.S. ally. Those remarks have been met with flat rejections from Greenland's leaders.",
      "\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Jacob Isbosethsen, Greenland\u2019s representative to the U.S, said Thursday at a forum in Washington sponsored by the Arctic Institute.",
      "In an effort not to show the Pentagon's hand on its routine effort to have plans for everything, Hegseth danced around the direct question from Smith, leading to the confusion.",
      "\u201cSpeaking on behalf of the American people, I don\u2019t think the American people voted for President Trump because they were hoping we would invade Greenland,\" Smith said.",

      "The reverence for Old Glory that inspired Flag Day came decades after the lifetime of the woman often credited with sewing the first United States national flag",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The woman often credited with sewing the first national U.S. flag \u2014 at the request of George Washington himself, her descendants claimed \u2014 might have been puzzled by Saturday's modern Flag Day.",
      "In Betsy Ross' day, flags marked ships and told soldiers where they should move in the confusion of battlefield smoke and noise. The intense reverence many Americans feel for Old Glory arose from the Civil War, when the need to keep the banner aloft in battle led the Union army to treat the deadly job of flag bearer as a high honor \u2014 and men responded with fatal heroics.",
      "The first, local Flag Day observances came after the Civil War and eventually a federal law designated June 14 as Flag Day in 1949, under World War I combat veteran Harry Truman. He declared in a proclamation the next year that the U.S. flag symbolizes freedom and \u201cprotection from tyranny.\u201d",
      "Americans' attachment to their flag is imbued with feelings that in other nations might attach to a beloved monarch or an official national religion. The flag is a physical object \u201cthat people can relate to,\u201d said Charles Spain, director of the Flag Research Center in Houston.",
      "\u201cIf you put a flag on a pole, the wind makes it move,\u201d Spain, a retired Texas Court of Appeals justice, added. \u201cTherefore, the flag is alive.\u201d",
      "The holiday marks the date in 1777 that the Continental Congress approved the design of a national flag for what to Great Britain were rebellious American colonies.",
      "It set the now-familiar 13 alternating horizontal stripes of red and white, one for each self-declared U.S. state, along with the blue upper quadrant with white stars. The Journals of Congress from 1777 says that the stars represented \u201ca new constellation,\u201d but a 1818 law mandated one white star for each state.",
      "National observances for Flag Day began well ahead of the law signed by Truman, with a proclamation issued by President Woodrow Wilson in 1916.",
      "Wilson\u2019s action came several decades after communities began Flag Day celebrations. In 1891, Philadelphia held its first \u2014 at one of Ross' former homes \u2014 and it evolved into an annual, weeklong Flag Fest.",
      "The small village of Waubeka, Wisconsin, north of Milwaukee, claims the first observance in 1885.",
      "According to the National Flag Day Foundation headquartered there, a 19-year-old teacher in a one-room school, Bernard Cigrand, put a small flag on his desk and had students write essays about what the flag meant to them. He advocated a national holiday for decades as he worked as a dentist in the Chicago area.",
      "Lisa Acker Moulder, director of the Betsy Ross House historical site in Philadelphia, said that for Ross, conferring with Washington would have been the key point of her account. The U.S. flag wasn't as venerated before the Civil War in 1861-65 as it is now.",
      "Keeping flags aloft was crucial to maneuvering troops in Civil War battles, and that made flag bearers big targets for the enemy. They couldn't shoot back and had to stand tall, said Ted Kaye, secretary for the North American association for flag scholars, known as vexillologists.",
      "Both sides' propaganda told soldiers that carrying a flag into battle was an honor reserved for the most morally fit \u2014 and that view took hold, Kaye said. One Michigan cavalry regiment\u2019s red flag declared, \u201cFear Not Death --Fear Dishonor.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis created this cult of honor around these battle flags, and around, by extension, the national flag,\u201d Kaye said.",
      "Civil War soldiers showed extraordinary courage under fire to keep their colors aloft, and multiple flag bearers died in single battles, said Matt VanAcker, who directs a now decades-old project at the Michigan Capitol to conserve flags from the Civil War and later conflicts. Michigan has collected about 240 old battle flags and had a display in its Capitol rotunda for decades.",
      "Replicas have replaced them so that the original banners \u2014 and pieces of banners \u2014 can be preserved as a physical link to the soldiers who fought under them.",
      "\u201cMany of the flags in our collection are covered with bullet holes,\u201d VanAcker said. \u201cA lot of them have blood stains \u2014 the physical evidence of their use on the battlefield.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Mourners are paying their respects to former U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel as his body lies in state Thursday at New York City Hall, an honor bestowed to a short list of political figures, including U.S. presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.",
      "The outspoken, gravel-voiced Harlem Democrat died May 26 at a New York hospital. He was 94.",
      "Rangel spent nearly five decades on Capitol Hill and was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
      "His funeral takes place Friday at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in midtown Manhattan. A wake was held Tuesday at a church in Harlem, the upper Manhattan neighborhood where Rangel, nicknamed the \u201cLion of Lenox Avenue,\u201d was born and raised.",
      "Rangel\u2019s body arrived at City Hall on Wednesday, where there was a private evening viewing for his family in the landmark neoclassical building at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge in lower Manhattan.",
      "On Thursday morning, a small group of mourners quietly came to pay their respects in City Hall as the surrounding streets bustled with tourists and workers.",
      "Rangel\u2019s closed casket sat in the building\u2019s marbled rotunda draped with an American flag. Uniformed police stood at rigid attention on either side of him, backed by the state and nation\u2019s flags.",
      "Mike Keogh, a 63-year-old lobbyist and former city council staffer, was among those who knew Rangel personally.",
      "\u201cHe had the greatest voice in New York politics at the time. It was so rich and so full,\u201d recalled Keogh. \u201cIt just made you feel really warm to be around him and to really hang on every word.\u201d",
      "Tina Marie grew up in Harlem and recalled Rangel as a part of the neighborhood\u2019s famed Gang of Four\u2014 Black Harlemites who rose to the very top of city and state politics in the 1970s through the 1990s.",
      "The others were David Dinkins, New York City\u2019s first Black mayor; Percy Sutton, who was Manhattan Borough president; and Basil Paterson, a deputy mayor and New York secretary of state.",
      "\u201cI didn't get to make the other three people\u2019s funerals so I wanted to come and pay my respects,\u201d said Marie, who now works for the state education department steps from City Hall. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with all the things they did, but they stood up for people who couldn\u2019t stand up for themselves.\u201d",
      "Besides Presidents Lincoln and Grant, the others accorded the City Hall honors after death include statesman Henry Clay, newspaper publisher Horace Greeley and Civil War generals Abner Doubleday and Joseph Hooker.",
      "The last person to lie in state in City Hall was City Councilman James Davis, who was assassinated by a political opponent in the council\u2019s chambers, located the floor above the rotunda, in 2003.",
      "Doors opened for the public to pay their respects to Rangel at 9 a.m. Thursday.",
      "The viewing will run until 5 p.m. and will be followed by an honor guard ceremony with pallbearers representing the 369th Regiment, an all-Black unit from World War I known as the Harlem Hellfighters.",
      "Rangel\u2019s funeral at St. Patrick\u2019s on Friday will also be public and livestreamed.",
      "The Korean War vet defeated legendary Harlem politician Adam Clayton Powell in 1970 to start his congressional career.",
      "Rangel went on to become the dean of the New York congressional delegation and the first African American to chair the powerful Ways and Means Committee in 2007.",
      "He was censured in 2010 by his fellow House members -- the most serious punishment short of expulsion -- following an ethics scandal.",
      "Rangel relinquished his post on the House\u2019s main tax-writing committee, but continued to serve until his retirement in 2017, becoming one of the longest-serving members in the chamber\u2019s history.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also a New York Democrat, lauded Rangel as a \u201cpatriot, hero, statesman, leader, trailblazer, change agent and champion for justice\u201d when his death was announced last month.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale prices rose modestly last month from a year earlier, another sign that inflationary pressures remain mild.",
      "The Labor Department reported Thursday that its producer price index \u2014 which measures inflation before it its consumers \u2014 rose 2.6% in May 2024. Producer prices rose 0.1% from April to May after dropping 0.2% the month before.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, wholesale costs were up 0.1% from April and 3% from May 2024.",

      "Since returning to the office, Trump has rolled out 10% tariffs on nearly every country in the world as well as specific levies on steel, aluminum and autos.

      "So far, his tariffs don\u2019t seem to have had much of an impact on prices overall.",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also watch it because some of its components, notably health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.",
      "But it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump\u2019s trade policies. The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at its meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday.",

      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings for deliveries of desperately needed food and other aid.",
      "The resolution, drafted by Spain and obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, \u201cstrongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.\u201d",
      "Experts and human rights workers say hunger is widespread in Gaza and some 2 million Palestinians are at risk of famine if Israel does not fully lift its blockade and halt its military campaign, which it renewed in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Last week, the U.N. Security Council failed to pass a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza and calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid. The United States vetoed the resolution because it was not linked to the release of the hostages, while all 14 other members of the council voted in favor.",
      "There are no vetoes in the 193-member General Assembly, where the resolution is expected to pass overwhelmingly. But unlike in the Security Council, assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",
      "After a 10-week blockade that barred all aid to Gaza, Israel is allowing the United Nations to deliver a trickle of food assistance and is backing a newly created U.S. aid group, which has opened several sites in the center and south of the territory to deliver food parcels.",
      "But the aid system rolled out last month by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been troubled by near-daily shootings as crowds make their way to aid sites, while the longstanding U.N.-run system has struggled to deliver food because of Israeli restrictions and a breakdown of law and order.",
      "The draft resolution being voted on Thursday references a March 28 legally binding order by the top United Nations court for Israel to open more land crossings into Gaza for food, water, fuel and other supplies. The International Court of Justice issued the order in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its war in Gaza, charges Israel strongly denies.",
      "The resolution stresses that Israel, as an occupying power, has an obligation under international law to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches those in need.",
      "It reiterates the assembly's commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian state. The assembly is holding a high-level meeting next week to push for a two-state solution, which Israel has rejected.",
      "The resolution supports mediation efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United States aimed at implementing a January ceasefire agreement. When the U.S. vetoed last week\u2019s Gaza resolution, acting Ambassador Dorothy Shea said it would have undermined the security of Israel and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire \u201cthat reflects the realities on the ground.\u201d",
      "Like the failed Security Council resolution, the resolution to be voted on Thursday also does not condemn Hamas\u2019 deadly attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war, or say the militant group must disarm and withdraw from Gaza. Both are U.S. demands.",
      "The Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage. About 55 hostages are still being held. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed over 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "WASHINGTON -- House Democrats are quietly engaged in a behind-the-scenes race for a key committee position, the second time in as many months that the party has had to fill one of the most prized positions in Congress.",
      "Four Democrats are running to be the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, an investigative panel with public clout, subpoena power and an expansive portfolio. The position is open due to the death last month of Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia.",
      "While Democrats in the minority have little power to shape the committee\u2019s work, the ranking member position comes with an enormous platform \u2014 and the possibility of becoming chair if the party wins back the majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Whoever wins will immediately be squaring off against Republicans as they prepare for splashy hearings this summer on immigration enforcement, LGBTQ rights and former President Joe Biden\u2019s age and mental condition while in office.",
      "As they hear from the candidates, Democrats are weighing many of the factors that were in play late last year, when Connolly, a veteran member of the committee, fended off a challenge from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.",
      "A look at how the race is shaping up:",
      "The debate over Biden\u2019s age coincides with a reckoning over seniority and generational change happening across the Democratic Party.",
      "Four House Democrats are running for the position: Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, the acting ranking member; Jasmine Crockett of Texas, a viral sensation; Robert Garcia, a former Los Angeles County mayor who has pitched colleagues on a government reform agenda; and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, former president of the NAACP and civil rights advocate.",
      "While Lynch is the most senior of the four, Democrats broadly said they are more open to breaking from seniority than they were in December, when Connolly, then 74, beat out Ocasio-Cortez, 35, for the job.",
      "Democrats are interested in how the candidates would communicate with the public, how they would help support lawmakers in battleground districts \u2014 and of course, how they would challenge President Donald Trump and his administration.",
      "Crockett, 44, has pitched herself as the candidate best able to compete with Trump\u2019s pugnacious and attention-grabbing style. Democrats, Crockett has argued, often fail to connect with voters and explain why the president\u2019s actions may be harmful. She believes she can.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of bringing that in, having a hearing and making sure that we are translating it and amplifying it,\u201d Crockett told MSNBC in an interview. \u201cCommunications has to be a full-on strategy.\u201d",
      "Garcia, 47, has focused on government reform and effectiveness, a key issue for Democrats after the Trump administration\u2019s blitz across federal agencies and mass firings of federal workers by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Mfume, 76, has attracted support from members impressed by his longtime stewardship of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights group. He returned to Congress after decades leading the NAACP following the death of a previous Democratic Oversight chair, the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, a fellow Baltimore Democrat.",
      "Lynch, 70, has styled himself as the acting chair and the lawmaker best positioned to take on the committee\u2019s chairman, Republican James Comer of Kentucky.",
      "\u201cThere are some members who speak to a very narrow audience, and that\u2019s great,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "\u201cWe want them to be energized and animated. But that same person is not going to go to the Rust Belt with people that are farmers, moderates, conservatives,\u201d Lynch told The Associated Press. \u201cYou need different voices to appeal to different constituencies.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I have a better chance of bringing back the blue-collar working people, and I have less of a chance of appealing to very younger people who are intensely invested in social media,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "The vote for Oversight ranking member is scheduled for June 24 and will be conducted by secret ballot. All four candidates are speaking before multiple caucuses this week, including the New Democrats and the progressive caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.",
      "While many Democrats are undecided, others have made up their mind. Some who are privately stumping for their candidate believe it will be a tight race. That makes the public forums and private pitches even more crucial in the run-up to the vote.",
      "House progressives are divided over their preferred choice. Three members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus \u2014 Crockett, Garcia and Mfume \u2014 are vying for the ranking member seat, which makes it unlikely the caucus will back a single candidate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for folks that could expose this kind of corruption and hold Trump and his billionaire donors accountable,\u201d said Rep. Greg Casar of Texas, the Progressive Caucus chair.",
      "Rep. Brad Schneider, chair of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, said he\u2019s weighing two factors: which candidate could best help Democrats win the 2026 midterm elections and whether they can successfully lead investigations into the Trump administration and \u201ctry to repair some of the damage that\u2019s been done.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe committee can be a flash point, or it can be a very effective place for us to make our point, and we want to know who\u2019s going to do best in that role to make sure the committee works to help us secure 218 (members) next November,\u201d Schneider said.",
      "Some Democratic caucuses have traditionally prized seniority as a clear and reliable way for lawmakers of color to rise through the ranks. There has never been a Hispanic Oversight chairman and only one Black chairman, Elijah Cummings.",
      "\u201cThe CBC has always stood for seniority,\u201d said Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. But Johnson noted that the Black Caucus has at times \u201cdeviated\u201d from that norm. He said many in the caucus are open to a conversation about age.",
      "\u201cSo, Steve Lynch, I think, is the next senior member. And but as I said, other factors have to be considered and I\u2019m sure that, along with myself, other CBC members are going through that process,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "\u201cSince I\u2019ve been here, seniority has had weight,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, who said he was undecided on which candidate to back. \u201cBut seniority is not the only thing. And there are times and circumstances where the person with the most seniority has not won. Whether that\u2019s one of these times or not is what we\u2019re going to see.\u201d",

      "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is calling President Donald Trump's military intervention at protests over federal immigration policy in Los Angeles an assault on democracy and has sued to try to stop it. Meanwhile, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is putting the National Guard on standby in areas in his state where demonstrations are planned.",
      "The divergent approaches illustrate the ways the two parties are trying to navigate national politics and the role of executive power in enforcing immigration policies.",
      "In his live TV address this week, Newsom said that Trump\u2019s move escalated the situation \u2014 and for political gain.",
      "All 22 other Democratic governors signed a statement sent by the Democratic Governors Association on Sunday backing Newsom, calling the Guard deployment and threats to send in Marines \u201can alarming abuse of power\u201d that \"undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The protests in Los Angeles have mostly been contained to five blocks in a small section of downtown; nearly 200 people were detained on Tuesday and at least seven police officers have been injured.",
      "In Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they're planning to deploy military troops for protests.",
      "Since Trump's return to office, Democratic governors have been calculating about when to criticize him, when to emphasize common ground and when to bite their tongues.",
      "The governors' responses are guided partly by a series of political considerations, said Kristoffer Shields, director of the Eagleton Center on the American Governor at Rutgers University: How would criticizing Trump play with Democrats, Republicans and independent voters in their states? And for those with presidential ambitions, how does that message resonate nationally?",
      "Democratic governors are weighing a number of considerations.",
      "\u201cThere probably is some concern about retributions \u2014 what the reaction of the administration could be for a governor who takes a strong stance,\" Shields said.",
      "And in this case, polling indicates about half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, though that polling was conducted before the recent military deployment.",
      "On other issues, Democratic governors have taken a variety of approaches with Trump.",
      "At a White House meeting in February, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills told Trump, \u201c we\u2019ll see you in court \u201d over his push to cut off funding to the state because it allowed transgender athletes in girls' school sports. Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, publicly sparred with Trump during his first term but this time around, has met with him privately to find common ground.",
      "Initially, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green referred to Trump as a \u201cstraight-up dictator,\" but the next month he told a local outlet that he was treading carefully, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticize him directly much at all.\"",
      "Apart from their joint statement, some of the highest-profile Democratic governors have not talked publicly about the situation in California. When asked, on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's office pointed to a Sunday social media post about the joint statement. Whitmer didn't respond.",
      "The office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who is set to testify before Congress on Thursday about his state laws protecting people who are in the country without legal status, reiterated in a statement that he stands with Newsom. The office said \u201clocal authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, in an interview Wednesday in The Washington Post, said Trump should not send troops to a weekend protest scheduled in Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s injected chaos into the world order, he\u2019s injected it into our economy, he is trying to inject chaos into our streets by doing what he did with the Guard in California,\" Shapiro said.",
      "As state attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term, Shapiro routinely boasted that he sued Trump over 40 times and won each time. As governor he has often treaded more carefully, by bashing Trump\u2019s tariffs, but not necessarily targeting Trump himself.",
      "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has often clashed with Newsom, a fellow term-limited governor with national ambitions.",
      "Newsom's office said DeSantis offered to send Florida State Guard troops to California.",
      "\u201cGiven the guard were not needed in the first place, we declined Governor DeSantis attempt to inflame an already chaotic situation made worse by his Party\u2019s leader,\u201d Newsom spokesperson Diana Crofts-Pelayo said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Tuesday, DeSantis said the gesture was a typical offer of mutual aid during a crisis \u2014 and was dismissive of the reasons it was turned down.",
      "\u201cThe way to put the fire out is to make sure you have law and order,\u201d he said.",
      "Protests against immigration enforcement raids have sprung up in other cities \u2014 and a series of \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations are planned for the weekend \u2014 with governors preparing to respond.",
      "In Connecticut, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said he has spoken with his public safety commissioner to make sure state and local police work together.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to give the president any pretext to think he can come into Connecticut and militarize the situation. That just makes the situation worse,\u201d said Lamont, who called Trump \"a little eager to send federal troops and militarize the situation in Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "It is unclear how many Texas National Guard members will be deployed or how many cities asked for assistance. In Austin, where police used chemical irritants to disperse several hundred protesters on Monday, the mayor\u2019s office said the National Guard was not requested.",
      "San Antonio officials also said they didn\u2019t request the Guard.",
      "Florida's DeSantis said law enforcement in his state is preparing \u201cThe minute you cross into attacking law enforcement, any type of rioting, any type of vandalism, looting, just be prepared to have the law come down on you,\u201d DeSantis said Tuesday. \u201cAnd we will make an example of you, you can guarantee it.\u201d",

      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, is set to receive a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. Hanson was sentenced to die after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson, whose name in some federal court records is George John Hanson, had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several unrelated federal convictions. Federal officials transferred him to Oklahoma custody in March to follow through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson's attorneys argued in a last-minute appeal that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month, claiming that one of the board members who denied him clemency was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office when Hanson was prosecuted. A district court judge this week temporary halted the execution, but an appeals court later cleared the way for it.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court late Wednesday rejected a separate appeal that alleged a key witness testified against Hanson in exchange for favorable treatment from prosecutors in a criminal case, information that was never disclosed to his defense team.",
      "Prosecutors allege Hanson and accomplice, Victor Miller, kidnapped Mary Bowles from a Tulsa shopping mall. Prosecutors allege the pair drove Bowles to a gravel pit near Owasso, where Miller shot and killed property owner Jerald Thurman. The two then drove Bowles a short distance away, where Hanson shot and killed Bowles, according to prosecutors. Miller received a no-parole life prison sentence for his role in the crimes.",
      "During last month's clemency hearing, Hanson expressed remorse for his involvement in the crimes and apologized to the victims' families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not an evil person,\u201d Hanson said via a video link from the prison. \u201cI was caught in a situation I couldn\u2019t control. I can\u2019t change the past, but I would if I could.\u201d",
      "Hanson\u2019s attorneys acknowledged he participated in the kidnapping and carjacking, but said there was no definitive evidence that he shot and killed Bowles. They painted Hanson as a troubled youth with autism and who was controlled and manipulated by the domineering Miller.",

Newsom has depicted the federal military intervention in the nation's second largest city as the onset of a much broader effort by Trump to overturn political and cultural norms at the heart of the nation\u2019s democracy. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has echoed that, saying the deployment of troops was unnecessary and meant to undermine local jurisdictions and intimidate the city\u2019s large immigrant population.",

      "The Trump administration called the lawsuit a \u201ccrass political stunt endangering American lives\u201d in its official response on Wednesday.",
      "The Democratic governor argued the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and said sending troops to help support immigration raids would only promote civil unrest.",

    "story": [
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said that a rare earth minerals shortage is hurting production and caused the automaker to temporarily shut down one of its plants last month, according to an interview with Bloomberg TV.",
      "Rare earth minerals, which are a set of 17 metallic elements, are integral to automobile production, and enable features like windshield wipers, seat belts and speakers to function. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",
      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",

      "The ad, which the billionaire heiress paid for, calls on people to participate in the\u00a0\"No Kings\" protest\u00a0slated to take place across the U.S. on June 14 \u2014 the same day\u00a0a military parade celebrating the Army's 250th Anniversary\u00a0is set to take place in Washington, D.C. The date of the parade and protests also coincides with Mr. Trump's birthday.",
      "The ad lists eight declarations, including \"WE honor our commitments and stand by our allies, WE defend against aggression by dictators, WE care for veterans and children, WE respect our neighbors and trading partners, WE support a health national and international economy, WE uphold the stability of rule of law,\" and more.",
      "More text is printed at the bottom of the full-page advertisement. \"We are the people of the United States of America. The honor, dignity, and integrity of our country are not for sale,\" it reads.",
      "\"Our government is of the people, by the people, for the people,\" the last line of the ad states.",
      "A spokesperson for Ms. Walton told CBS MoneyWatch that Sunday's ad \"focuses on encouraging people to engage peacefully and civically in next weekend's events on June 14th.\"",
      "Walmart sought to distance the retail chain from Ms. Walton's ad. \"The advertisements from Christy Walton are in no way connected to or endorsed by Walmart. She does not serve on the board or play any role in decision-making at Walmart,\" the company said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Eat the tariffs\"",
      "Walmart is among the major U.S. retailers that have said Mr. Trump's tariff policies would force them to pass on added costs to customers.",
      "\"We can control what we can control,\" Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said during the company's first-quarter earnings call last month. \"Even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump later warned Walmart against raising its prices, writing on social media that it should \"eat the tariffs\"\u00a0instead of raising prices on some goods.",
      "When asked about the planned protests Thursday, Mr. Trump said he did not feel like a king because \"I have to go through hell to get stuff approved.\"",
      "What is the \"No Kings\" protest?",
      "A website dedicated to the protest explains that Saturday will mark \"a national day of action and mass mobilization\" in response to what it calls \"the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration.\"",
      "\"We've watched as they've cracked down on free speech, detained people for their political positions, threatened to deport American citizens, and defied the courts. They've done this all while continuing to serve and enrich their billionaire allies. They think they rule \u2014 but we are bigger than even their worst aspirations,\" the site reads.",
      "The nationwide\u00a0protest\u00a0was deliberately scheduled for June 14 to divert attention away from the military parade in Washington, D.C. scheduled to take place on the same date, the group said on the site.",
      "Ms. Walton, through her spokesperson, added that she does not condone violence, and that her interest lies \"in encouraging people to listen to one another, participate in their communities, and productively engage on the issues they care about.\"",
      "\"She believes while we have the right to protest, we do not have a right to violence. She condemns violence in all forms and her message promotes civic engagement, peaceful dialogue, and the sharing of diverse views and voices,\" her spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "An estimated 4 million Americans will lose health insurance over the next decade if Congress doesn't extend enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act marketplace coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday urged Iran to \"make a deal, before there is nothing left\" after Israel launched roughly 200 strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, senior military leaders and research scientists, the opening attacks in what Israeli officials said is part of a major operation against Iran.",
      "Iran launched barrages of missiles against targets in Israel in retaliation on Friday, and the U.S. helped Israel intercept the missiles, U.S. officials confirmed.",
      "Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump urged Iran to\u00a0agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Mr. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, a White House official said.",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said in one post to his social media site, Truth Social, \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"",
      "The president said he had warned Iran about what would follow if it failed to reach a deal on its nuclear program.",

They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!\"",
      "When the Wall Street Journal asked Mr. Trump Friday morning if the U.S. was notified ahead of the attack,\u00a0the president responded, \"Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.\" In a second Truth Social post, Mr. Trump suggested that he would give Iran a \"second chance\" to agree to limits on its nuclear program after initially setting a 60-day deadline.",

Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of the staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, were killed in the strikes.",

      "Dates were still being discussed for Mr. Trump's visit, seen as an effort to shore up farm country for Republicans and to help celebrate the 250th anniversary of the nation's independence.",
      "He could do an event at the fairgrounds in July instead of attending the opening day of the state fair in August, two of the sources said. He may do a rally at the grandstand.",

On a stroll around the fairgrounds, Mr. Trump was mobbed with people, and attendance spiked to a record for the year with more than 118,000 visitors. He won the Iowa caucuses in January 2024 by about 30 points.",
      "A year ago, Mr. Trump said that if he were elected again, he would organize a big bash ahead of the nation's semiquincentennial on July 4, 2026, with a year-long exhibition that he hoped would be hosted at the Iowa State Fairgrounds with \"pavilions from all 50 states.\"",

      "The Army is commemorating its 250th anniversary with a festival and parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, June 14, which is also President Trump's 79th birthday. The event, according to Army officials, is expected to include about 6,600 soldiers, as well as about 150 vehicles and over 50 aircraft in the celebration.",
      "Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend the festivities, D.C. officials told reporters in a briefing Monday.",
      "Here's what else to know:",
      "Why is the festival and parade being held on June 14?",
      "The Second Continental Congress, on June 14, 1775, voted to establish official companies following the fighting at Lexington and Concord against British troops. Congress voted to create the Continental Army and then on June 15 put George Washington as commander in chief.",
      "Planning has been in the works for almost two years to commemorate the anniversary with a festival, according to Army officials, but a parade was only added earlier this year. Army officials said the Army is not expected to officially recognize Mr. Trump's birthday.",
      "How much will the event cost?",
      "Army officials estimate the entire festival and parade could cost between $25 million and $45 million but did not disclose the cost before the parade was added to the schedule.",
      "When asked by members of Congress about the justification for the cost as the Trump administration has sought cuts across the federal government, Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said the United States has an \"an amazing opportunity\" to tell a story about the Army.",
      "\"I believe very specifically that telling that story will directly lead to a recruiting boom that will fill up our pipeline for the coming years,\" Driscoll told the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "What is the parade route?",
      "On June 14, the festival will take place on the National Mall in D.C. from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. The parade will start at 6:30 p.m., running from 23rd Street NW along Constitution Avenue to 15th Street NW and wrap up around 7:30 p.m. A fireworks show will follow the parade at 9:45 p.m.",
      "When was the last time D.C. hosted a military parade?",
      "The most recent time D.C. hosted a military parade was in 1991, to mark the end of the Gulf War. The National Victory parade featured around 8,000 service members, and about 200,000 people watched the parade. According to The Washington Post, the event cost $8 million.",
      "How has the military prepared for the event?",
      "The Army has been laying down metal plates to prevent damage to D.C. roads by some of the heavier equipment like M1A1 Abrams tanks, which can weigh over 60 tons. If there is any damage to the roads, the Army has committed to pay for the repair.",
      "An Army spokesperson said the military will strategically place 1-inch steel plates \u2014 in sizes ranging from 4 feet by 8 feet to 8 feet by 20 feet \u2014 at points where the equipment will turn.",
      "U.S. Army Col. Jesse Curry, director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, said during a security briefing on Monday that in addition to the plates, \"the tanks all have brand new rubber track pads placed on them, which increase the padding that they have underneath each track to minimize that potential damage, and it's a parade, so they're going to be moving slowly.\"",
      "What soldiers and equipment will participate?",
      "About 6,600 soldiers representing every era of the Army's 250 years of history are expected to participate in the parade, according to Army officials. In addition, the Army anticipates about 150 vehicles, and more than 50 aircraft will participate in the celebration.",
      "The parade will feature different eras of the Army's history, from the Revolutionary War to the modern era and into the future with corresponding uniforms and equipment.",
      "Army officials say among the equipment included will be 26 M1A1 Abrams tanks, 27 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, two World War II Sherman tanks, a World War I-era Renault tank, eight CH-47 helicopters, 16 UH-60 Black Hawks and four WWII-era P-51 aircraft.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 09:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The Joro spider, Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer.",
      "A \"sneaky\" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts.",
      "Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter, a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia.",
      "\"It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,\" Suiter recently told the university.",
      "Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,\" Suiter says. \"And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen.\"",
      "Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer.",
      "What are Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis\u00a0\u2014 roughly translated as \"short, wicked ant from China\" \u2014 but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to \"cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site\u00a0antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University, and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas.",
      "Suiter says Asian needle ants are \"sneaky\" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding.",
      "\"Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,\" the U.S. Forest Service says.",
      "Environmental impacts",
      "According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments.",
      "\"They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,\" he says.",
      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

    "summary": "NASA wants to evaluate recent efforts to stop a small but persistent air leak in the Russian segment of the space station.",
    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",
      "China has leveraged its grip on rare earths and their widespread utility amid a trade war with the U.S. In April, Beijing announced greater export controls on the materials \u2014 a sticking point in tariff negotiations \u2014 along with other retaliatory trade measures. The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",
      "\"The centrality of rare earth export restrictions to the trade deal underscores the criticality of minerals to the U.S. economy as well as the severity of the chokehold Beijing holds on global supply chains,\" policy experts from the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in a research note.",
      "\"Hand-to-mouth\"",
      "Farley said the slowing flow of the critical minerals into the U.S. has presented a challenge for Ford.",
      "\"It's day to day,\" he told Bloomberg TV Friday. \"We have had to shut down factories. It's hand-to-mouth right now.\"",
      "Ford did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Ford Chief Financial Officer\u00a0Sherry House addressed disruptions caused by new restrictions on rare earth minerals from China at a June conference.",
      "\"There are many components that rare earth minerals are in. And any of those that are coming from China require you to now go through export control,\" she said. \"And so there's an additional layer of administrative process that has to happen.\"",
      "The process isn't reliable, she added, noting that sometimes it goes \"really smoothly,\" while other times applications are not approved quickly.",
      "\"Most frequently, it goes through; it just may take more time,\" she said.",
      "For now, Ford is able to manage the cumbersome process, House said, but added that it has the potential to become a \"larger issue for us.\"",
      "Farley also told the outlet that he is optimistic about the developments in trade talks between the U.S. and China, and hopes that rare earth supply constraints will ease soon. He added that Ford is awaiting approval of applications with China's Ministry of Commerce to export more rare earths.",
      "\"We have applications into MOFCOM and they are being approved one at a time,\" Farley told Bloomberg TV.",

      "Iran launched barrages of missiles against targets in Israel in retaliation on Friday, and the U.S. helped Israel intercept the missiles, U.S. officials confirmed.",
      "Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump urged Iran to\u00a0agree to new restrictions on its nuclear program while it still can. The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Mr. Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, a White House official said.",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said in one post to his social media site, Truth Social, \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.\"",
      "The president said he had warned Iran about what would follow if it failed to reach a deal on its nuclear program.",

They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!\"",
      "When the Wall Street Journal asked Mr. Trump Friday morning if the U.S. was notified ahead of the attack,\u00a0the president responded, \"Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.\" In a second Truth Social post, Mr. Trump suggested that he would give Iran a \"second chance\" to agree to limits on its nuclear program after initially setting a 60-day deadline.",

      "In a video statement, Netanyahi dubbed the attack \"Operation Rising Lion\" and said it is a targeted military operation \"to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\" Iranian state television said the head of its Revolution Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of the staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, were killed in the strikes.",
      "Netanyahu said the assault \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"",

But Brigadier General Effie Defrin, spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said the country's air defenses were \"working to intercept the threats.\" Iran's supreme leader on Friday said Israel will will not remain unscathed.",

      "\"Israel and the United States have been united, including in our shared insistence that Iran must never obtain a nuclear weapon,\" Johnson wrote\u00a0on X. \"President Trump and his administration have worked tirelessly to ensure that outcome. Unfortunately, Iran has refused to agree and even declared yesterday its intent to build a new enrichment facility.   Israel decided it needed to take action to defend itself. They were clearly within their right to do so.   Iran will face grave consequences if it responds by unjustifiably targeting U.S. interests.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Israel's strikes \"an escalation that is deeply concerning and will inevitably invite counterattacks\" and said the Trump administration \"must quickly move to deescalate the situation.\"",
      "\"This risks not only U.S. negotiations with Iran, but the safety of American service members, diplomats, their families and ex-pats around the region,\" she said in a statement. \"I agree with President Trump's instinct to distance the U.S. from Israel's actions, but Iran and its proxies are unlikely to differentiate the U.S. from Israel.\"",

      "A rattle of drums at four a.m. on July 1, 1777, roused the British encampment at Crown Point, on the western lip of Lake Champlain. Soldiers stumbled from their tents, shrugged on their uniform coats, and gobbled down a cold breakfast with the indifference of men who expected no better. For the past fortnight the invasion force of eight thousand troops had sailed and rowed south for a hundred miles, from the Richelieu River in Quebec to within fifteen miles of the American stronghold at Fort Ticonderoga. Through mischance and rebel defiance, many of these same redcoats had failed to capture the fortress eight months earlier, despite standing at the gates. Now the prize again lay within grasp, and this time they intended to win through. \"We are to contend for the king and the constitution of Great Britain, to vindicate law and to relieve the oppressed,\" orders issued the previous evening proclaimed. \"This army must not retreat.\"",
      "By five a.m., the sun had crested the great shoulders of the Green Mountains to the east, gilding the craggy Adirondacks in the west. Platoon after platoon scuffed down to the shoreline to clamber aboard gunboats, longboats, and six-oared, flat-bottomed bateaux. Shouted orders carried across the lake, along with the creak of capstans and oarlocks. Soon the first vessels pulled away from the anchorage, to assemble mid-lake in battle formation. Army musicians caught the moment and struck up martial airs. \"The music and drums of the different regiments were continually playing,\" a Royal Artillery lieutenant wrote, \"and contributed to make the scene and passage extremely pleasant.\"",
      "More than a hundred birch-bark canoes led the flotilla. Each carried twenty to thirty warriors, mostly Iroquois sporting nose rings, slitted earlobes, and feathers in tufted topknots, their eyelids and cheeks daubed with vermilion paint. Some wore knife sheaths made from lynx skins and, a British officer recorded, an \"arse clout, or covering for the privities.\"",
      "Arrayed across the mile-wide lake behind the Indian vanguard came the main battle force, \"the most complete and splendid regatta you can possibly conceive,\" a witness reported: the three-masted frigate Royal George, built by shipwrights in Canada during the winter and carrying 26 guns, and smaller vessels named Inflexible, Carleton, Maria, and Royal Convert, as well as 44 gunboats, 23 longboats, 26 cutters, 260 bateaux, and a wallowing ninety-one-foot radeau, or raft, the Thunderer, ferrying barreled gunpowder and heavy cannons intended to blast Ticonderoga's walls to rubble. A brig, a gundalow, and a sloop\u2014Washington, Jersey, and Lee\u2014had been captured in October from the rebel general turned commodore Benedict Arnold, whose gallant, forlorn rearguard fight in these very waters had helped delay the earlier British attack until winter forced the invaders back to Canada. All told, this squadron carried 133 naval guns to complement the army's 130 field cannons, mortars, and howitzers, each barrel stamped with the king's monogram or other symbols of possession. Storeships and lake transports continued to arrive at Crown Point from the north, laden with almost five thousand tons of salt pork, hard biscuits, and other rations, along with siege tools, ammunition, rum, cattle, and civilian camp followers, whose numbers officially included 225 women and 500 children, although some hyperbolists would claim that the combined figure actually approached two thousand.",
      "\"It looked,\" wrote Corporal Roger Lamb of the 9th Regiment of Foot, \"like some stupendous fairy scene of a dream.\" By late afternoon, many troops had disembarked on either shore to join the advance regiments moving toward Ticonderoga, now just a few miles ahead. Bullfrogs croaked in the shallows, and white elderberry blossoms brightened the conifer thickets, \"the birthplace of every biting insect,\" one miserable chaplain wrote. Some men smeared cedar sap on their faces in a vain effort to repel mosquitoes and deerflies.",
      "On the left, to the east, four thousand mercenaries plodded through the underbrush. Known collectively as Hessians, since most Germans hired by London to fight in America came from Hesse-Kassel, this contingent was largely from the small, impoverished duchy of Brunswick, whose ruling family had intermarried with the British royal family. Brunswick's duke collected \u00a37 a year for each rented soldier, plus a blood-money bounty for every man killed or captured and an equivalent stipend for every three wounded. The troops earned the same eight pence a day as their British comrades, minus deductions for food and uniforms. Most of the German troops had spent an agreeable winter in isolated bivouacs along the St. Lawrence and Richelieu Rivers, developing a taste for beaver tail, salted sturgeon, and maple sugar.",
      "Jager scouts\u2014professional hunters\u2014led the column, distinctive in their green coats trimmed in crimson and black hats decorated with pompoms. Dragoons followed in leather breeches and woolen gaiters, dismounted for the moment but hopeful of finding American horses ahead. Armed with short carbines and three-foot broad-swords, many cultivated horizontal waxed mustaches and wore their hair in a queue down the back \"like a Chinese mandarin,\" an admirer wrote. Grenadiers, artillerymen, musicians, gunsmiths, servants, and sutlers filled out the procession, prodded forward by blue-coated officers wearing silver sashes and wielding canes or pointed spontoons. During the voyage down the lake, some men had stripped to the waist to bask in the warm sun and, a surgeon reported, \"have been badly sunburned, large blisters developing on their skin.\"",
      "The Germans were led by Major General Friedrich Adolph Riedesel. Thirty-nine years old, with a moon face and a ramrod bearing, he had forsaken his law studies in Marburg to take up soldiering, soon demonstrating a hussar's valor at Minden during the Seven Years' War. Fluent in French and conversational English, Riedesel considered the opportunity to command in North America to be \"sent by Providence.\" He had sworn allegiance to George III, like each of his Brunswickers, and had predicted in a dispatch to his duke that \"this campaign will finish the war.\" Although British officers could be insufferably supercilious toward their German allies, he got on well with the redcoats, even if they stumbled over the pronunciation of his name, calling him \"General Red Hazel.\"",
      "Those redcoats could now be seen across the lake, moving south in a snaking column parallel to the Germans. Brawny grenadiers, often used to lead assaults, had exchanged their tall bearskin hats for more practical felt caps trimmed in horse-hair. Each foot soldier carried a ten-pound musket, a sixteen-inch bayonet, a tin canteen, a linen haversack, and his own blanket\u2014a battlefield luxury, since in peacetime five men typically shared two blankets. British infantrymen were among the finest soldiers in the world, but most of these troops were green; only the 47th Regiment of Foot had seen extensive combat, at Lexington and Bunker Hill, among other clashes. They were led nonetheless by an exceptional cadre of junior officers, thirty of whom would become generals, including eighteen destined to be full generals, the army's highest rank. In addition, another six future general officers could be found among the twenty-two Royal Artillery officers in the column.",
      "Squinting at both shorelines through his spyglass from the pitching deck of the Royal George, Lieutenant General John Burgoyne was as pleased with his invasion force as he was with himself. At fifty-four, he had endured a long and arduous climb to high command, and he intended to return to London to claim the laurels owed every victorious commander. Educated at Westminster School, where even mathematics was taught in Latin and boys were birched for the slightest transgression, he had joined the army at fifteen, earned a reputation as both a swordsman and a card sharp, then wrecked his career by eloping with Charlotte Stanley, the youngest daughter of a very angry earl. Effectively banished to France and forced to sell his commission, Burgoyne lived modestly with Charlotte on the Seine for seven years, growing vegetables, traveling the Continent, and making a living at whist and twenty-one.",
      "At last all was forgiven, and a belated reconciliation brought the couple back to England. Burgoyne returned to duty as an aging dragoon captain, just in time to win fame at the cannon's mouth in the Seven Years' War, notably in Normandy and Brittany against the French, and on the Tagus River near Lisbon against the Spanish. The king of Portugal gave him a diamond ring in gratitude, and he emerged from the struggle as a British war hero.",
      "Burgoyne's ascent continued in peacetime. Elected to the House of Commons, he was a diligent, independent military reformer. His insights from an inspection tour of Continental armies impressed George III, as did his parliamentary investigation of East India Company corruption. He and Charlotte shuttled between fine houses in Lancashire and Surrey and on Hertford Street, in tony Mayfair, an easy stroll from the London gambling tables at Brooks's club. An aspiring playwright, he also became a regular in the Green Room at Drury Lane Theater, where in 1774 the actor and impresario David Garrick directed Burgoyne's The Maid of the Oaks, a triumphant success.",

    "story": [
      "The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which was linked to a large surge of hospitalizations in parts of Asia, could now make up more than 1 in 3 cases across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected\u00a0this week.",
      "Last month, the CDC's airport surveillance program had\u00a0detected cases of the variant in arriving international travelers from several countries. The agency\u00a0now says\u00a0that nearly half of the COVID infections detected in that program the last week of May were the NB.1.8.1 variant.",
      "The CDC cautioned that \"precision in the most recent reporting period is low\" for their estimates, meaning the projections carry a wide margin of error. Still, the estimated increase in prevalence in the U.S. highlights the variant's high transmissibility \u2014 something experts had warned about as soon as it began spreading in this country.",
      "\"Data indicates that NB.1.8.1 does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, although it appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily. In other words, it is more transmissible,\" Subhash Verma, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine, previously\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "Symptoms of the variant are broadly similar to those seen in earlier strains, Verma noted. Typical symptoms include respiratory issues such as cough and sore throat, as well as systemic issues like fever and fatigue.",
      "As health officials continue monitoring the virus, the Trump administration has recently made moves to change access to vaccines for some Americans.",
      "In May, the Food and Drug Administration said it will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and those with an\u00a0underlying medical condition, including pregnancy or diabetes, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use.",
      "The decision means many people without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0also said last month that he would remove the CDC's recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Later that week, however, the CDC said that kids with no underlying health conditions \"may receive\" COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,\" the CDC says in its new guidance.",

For the past several weeks, he has been moving northward, with his tracking device pinging multiple times off the coast of South Carolina and North Carolina. On June 11, his tracker pinged just 22 miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras.",
      "OCEARCH said in an Instagram post that Contender appears to be following standard great white migratory patterns and heading up north for the summer season, and is \"making moves along the Atlantic coast.\" The species spends the winter in warmer, southern waters, OCEARCH said. The sharks then head to \"cooler, more prey-dense waters\" near Canada for the next few months.",
      "The Outer Banks are a \"common rest stop\" for the species, OCEARCH said, likely because of rich food resources in the area. The spot also allows the sharks to prepare for the journey north, which may span more than 1,000 miles.",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Jun 2025 16:13:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Sirens sounded in Israel as the Israel's military said Iran launched ballistic missiles and more than 100 drones in what appeared to be the start of Iranian retaliation for Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities.",
    "story": [
      "Warning sirens sounded across Israel on Friday and Iran fired dozens of missiles into Israel, in a retaliatory attack after Israel launched overnight airstrikes.",
      "Israel has a robust missile defense system known as the Iron Dome, which appeared to have intercepted numerous missiles, but CBS News Middle East reporter Courtney Kealy said several sites in Tel Aviv appeared to have been hit. The extent of any damage is not yet clear. Videos and photos showed a building in Tel Aviv on fire. The Israel Defense Forces reported that 21 people had been injured. Two are in serious condition, the IDF said.",
      "Around 100 missiles were fired from Iran in two salvos. Most were intercepted by the Iron Dome, the IDF said, adding that there were a limited number of hits on structures, some from interception failures.",
      "A U.S. official and a White House official confirmed to CBS News that the United States has helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles. Additional information was not immediately available. During the strikes, U.S. troops at two bases in the Middle East were ordered into bunkers. Troops at Union III in the Green Zone in Baghdad, Iraq, and Al-Tanf Garrison in Syria spent about an hour in the bunkers, CBS News confirmed.",
      "A third wave of missiles is not expected, CBS News contributor Robert Berger reported, and people in Israel have been told they can leave their bomb shelters.",
      "The retaliatory action from Iran came after Israel launched over 200 airstrikes on Iran \u2014 continuing a\u00a0major operation\u00a0that began overnight, IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said Friday. Israel's airstrikes are continuing, Defrin said.",
      "Israel first launched airstrikes on Iran early Friday and announced its operation was targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists and senior military commanders. Tehran responded by launching more than 100 drones at Israel on Friday morning, Israel's military said. Defrin said earlier Friday that Israel's air defenses had worked to \"intercept the threats.\" Later Friday, an Israeli military official told reporters that while the threat wasn't over, Israel had managed to intercept many of Iran's UAVs.",
      "\"Throughout the day, we once again demonstrated our ability to remove threats in a coordinated, precise and daring manner,\" Defrin said Friday night local time.",
      "In a televised statement on Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Iranian Armed Forces would respond fiercely to the strikes and leave Israel \"helpless.\"",
      "Shortly after the statement, the IDF confirmed that its fighter jets had \"completed a strike on the Iranian regime's nuclear site in the Isfahan area.\" Ishafan is in central Iran. The strike \"dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories and additional infrastructure,\" the IDF said.",
      "The U.S. was not involved in Israel's strikes, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, adding a warning that \"Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.\"",
      "President Trump said in a post Friday morning on his Truth Social media platform that he had given Iran \"chance after chance\" to make a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but that despite his warnings to Tehran that the alternative would be \"much worse\" than anything seen before, \"they just couldn't get it done.\"",
      "\"There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.\"",
      "In a later post on Friday, Mr. Trump said he \"gave Iran a 60 day ultimatum to 'make a deal.' They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!\"",
      "Israel has intercepted virtually every Iranian weapon launched in previous large-scale attacks by the Islamic republic. The retaliatory action by Iran was long anticipated and well planned for, Defrin said.",
      "Iran's President Mahsoud Pezeshkian said Friday on Iranian TV that the country would \"strongly take action\" against Israel in response to the attacks, promising \"a severe, wise and strong answer.\"",
      "\"The Iranian nation and the country's officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,\" he said.",
      "Israel says it destroyed Iran's air defenses, killed top commanders",
      "Earlier Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the IDF had begun \"Operation Rising Lion,\" with a massive wave of airstrikes against dozens of Iranian nuclear sites, military commanders and research scientists, saying the goal was to \"roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival.\"",
      "Like Netanyahu, Defrin, the IDF spokesman, called the attack on Iran preemptive in a video statement delivered Friday, saying Israeli intelligence had uncovered an Iranian \"plan to destroy Israel that has taken shape in recent years.\" He said that plan involved Iran \"racing towards a nuclear bomb,\" working to double or triple its ballistic missile stockpile, and continuing to \"finance, arm, and operate its proxies throughout the Middle East against the State of Israel.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that the senior security leadership of the Iranian regime has been eliminated in the strike: the Iranian Chief of Staff, [Mohammad] Bagheri; the Commander of the Revolutionary Guards, [Hossein] Salami; and the Head of the Emergency Command, [Gholamali] Rashid,\" Defrin said, adding that other commanders had been killed and that Israeli would provide further updates. He said Israel had \"targeted and struck the Iranian regime's aerial defense arrays.\"",
      "The IDF said its operation would continue for days, but that the first wave consisted of 200 Israeli fighter jets dropping \"over 330 different munitions,\" to hit more than 100 targets in Iran.",
      "\"The breadth and scale of these strikes \u2014 against senior Iranian officials and other military facilities in addition to nuclear sites \u2014 suggest this operation is intended to not just dissuade Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons, but also cripple any potential military response and even to destabilize the regime,\" Matthew Savill, Director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, said in a statement. \"Israel has once again demonstrated its considerable conventional military superiority, and the size of the force allegedly assembled for this series of attacks represents the overwhelming bulk of their longer-range strike aircraft. They have the ability to conduct multiple such rounds of strikes, but operating for an extended duration over this considerable range will stretch even the Israeli Air Force.\"",
      "Savill said Iran's response \"might be delayed or split into multiple phases, but their main weapon will be ballistic missiles, which have the best chance of inflicting damage on Israel, whereas drone and cruise missile attacks will face more extensive Israeli defenses. Israel operations have therefore targeted air defenses and ballistic missile sites to forestall this.\"",
      "Savill said that if Iran \"believes the U.S. or others were involved\" in the Israeli strike, then their retaliation could include targeting the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, and American air facilities in Qatar, \"though both would widen the conflict to drag in others.\"",
      "NATO chief urges de-escalation, says nuclear clash \"not close\"",
      "Iranian state media said the Israeli strikes had hit several cities, including in the capital of Tehran and the city of Natanz, a key center for Iran's uranium enrichment program. The IDF said it struck Iran's uranium enrichment site in the Natanz area.",
      "\"The underground area of the site was damaged,\" the IDF said in a statement. \"This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure. In addition, critical infrastructure enabling the site's continuous operation and the Iranian regime's ongoing efforts to obtain nuclear weapons were targeted.\"",
      "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, said in a series of social media posts that its Director General, Rafael Grossi, had been in contact with Iranian authorities on Friday, who told him the country's highly-sensitive and highly-secured Fordo nuclear site \"has not been impacted\" by the Israeli strikes. Later Friday, Reuters reported that two explosions had been heard near the site and that state media said Iranian air defenses had shot down an Israeli drone near the facility.",
      "The IAEA also said Iran's \"Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant had not been targeted and that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site.\"",
      "On Friday, during a visit to Sweden, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told reporters that \"this was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate.\"",
      "Despite the ongoing attacks, Rutte said he believed the region was \"not close\" to a possible nuclear conflict.",
      "While there have been no claims that Iran has yet built a nuclear weapon, Israel is believed to have multiple warheads, though it has never formally confirmed nor denied its status as a nuclear-armed nation.",
      "Iranian officials quickly threatened retaliation to the attack, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying Israel \"should await a harsh response.\"",
      "The IDF said in a statement before Iran's retaliatory strikes that it had prepared for \"a campaign on the frontline and on the home front.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel's strikes against Iran, \"will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.\"",
      "Shortly after Israel's strikes, the U.S. Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place.",
      "A day beforehand, the Trump administration\u00a0ordered\u00a0non-emergency U.S. personnel to leave Iraq and allowed U.S. military family members to leave the Middle East voluntarily.",
      "Risk of an escalating regional conflict",
      "Israel has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in recent years, while Iran has backed foes of Israel, including the militant group Hamas.",
      "In April of last year, Iran\u00a0launched missiles and drones\u00a0at Israel after a strike on Iran's consulate\u00a0in Damascus\u00a0was widely attributed to Israel, but the Israeli military intercepted the vast majority of the weapons.",
      "Six months later, Iran\u00a0launched more\u00a0missiles at Israel, which retaliated with strikes on Iranian sites.",
      "Friday's back-and-forth could escalate to be among the most severe clashes between Israel and Iran, which have been adversaries for decades. Mr. Trump warned earlier in the week that the strikes could snowball into a \"massive\" conflict.",
      "Farea Al-Muslimi, a research fellow at the Chatham House think tank, said in a statement Friday that the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen could play a role in the Iranian response to Israel.",
      "\"With Iran currently weakened and humiliated, this marks the first time the Houthis will be called upon to repay decades of Iranian investment and support,\" Al-Muslimi predicted. \"Following the killing of Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, the Houthis have effectively become Iran's first line of defense against Israel \u2014 an increasingly central role.\"",
      "Al-Muslimi said the Houthi response could extend beyond retaliatory strikes on Israel itself.",
      "\"Strikes in the Red Sea will likely resume, the ceasefire with the United States may unravel, and we shouldn't be surprised if Saudi Arabia and the UAE are dragged back into direct conflict in Yemen,\" Al-Muslimi said. \"Attacks by the Houthis on U.S. military bases in the Gulf, the Horn of Africa, and naval forces at sea are also highly plausible.\"",

      "In response, Iran launched more than 100 drones at Israel, many of which were intercepted by Israel's air defenses. Following additional strikes by Israel, Iran fired more missiles at Israel. While most were intercepted, there were \"a limited number of hits on structures, some from interception failures,\" the IDF said.",
      "The maps below show the confirmed locations of Israel's initial strikes.",
      "In a later round of strikes, the IDF said it had hit \"the Iranian regime's nuclear site in the Isfahan area,\" located south of Natanz in central Iran.",

      "Another enrichment site in Fordow had not been hit as of Friday morning, according to Iran and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Later Friday, two explosions were heard near the site and state media said Iranian air defenses shot down an Israeli drone near the facility, according to Reuters.",
      "In Natanz, \"the underground area of the site was damaged,\" the IDF said in a statement.",
      "\"This area contains a multi-story enrichment hall with centrifuges, electrical rooms, and additional supporting infrastructure,\" the IDF said. \"In addition, critical infrastructure enabling the site's continuous operation and the Iranian regime's ongoing efforts to obtain nuclear weapons were targeted.\"",

Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the IRGC's missile program.",

      "Out of the 242 people who were on board Air India flight AI171 when the plane crashed in Ahmedabad on Thursday, moments after takeoff, just one is believed to have survived. A day later, that survivor, British national Viswash Kumar Ramesh, spoke about the moment the plane \"came to a standstill\" in midair, and how he escaped from seat 11A and walked out of the wreckage with a burnt hand.",
      "\"Everything happened in front of my eyes. I don't believe (know) how I survived,\" Ramesh, 40, said from his hospital bed on Friday. \"For some time I thought I was also going to die. But when I opened my eyes, I realized I was alive. ... It was in front of my eyes that the air hostess and others (died).\"",

      "\"After the takeoff, within a minute, it felt like the plane came to a standstill (in air) for 5 to 10 seconds,\" Ramesh said. \"The green and white (cabin) lights turned on in the flight. I could feel engine thrust increasing to go up, but it crashed with speed into the (building).\"",
      "Once he realized what had happened, he said he tried to unbuckle from his seat and get out. Local media outlets who spoke with him said he had a ticket for the flight showing he was seated in 11A, which police also confirmed. It was right by an exit row door.",

      "A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)",
      "There is video showing the plane flying low over buildings before it disappears behind them and a large explosion is seen. The plane itself did not appear to be on fire or explode prior to going behind the buildings.",
      "The vice president of the Federation of All India Medical Association told The Associated Press that part of the plane hit the dining area of B.J. Medical College. At least five medical students were killed and nearly 50 people who had been in the building were injured. Footage of the aftermath shows plates and cups filled with food and drinks still on the tables, covered in debris.",
      "\"Did you walk out of it?\" a reporter asked Ramesh, to which he replied, \"Yes.\"",
      "\"When the fire broke out, my left hand got burnt,\" Ramesh said. \"Then an ambulance brought me here to the hospital.\"",

      "\"All of us at Air India are devastated by this loss and grieve for those affected, their families and their loved ones,\" he said. \"...We know that the investigations will take time, but we will be fully transparent and we will support the process for as long as it takes.\"",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' defense team has complained about the secrecy of certain aspects of the trial, including a famous rapper being mentioned \u2014 but not named \u2014 during testimony.",
      "Before the 55-year-old music mogul's trial resumed on Thursday, lawyers representing Combs and federal prosecutors engaged in a back and forth about naming individuals who were present with Combs' ex-girlfriend Jane during a Las Vegas night that took place in January 2024. However, this was done behind closed doors and even Combs himself was not present.",
      "Once all parties were back in the courtroom, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo complained to U.S. District Judge\u00a0Arun Subramanian about the fact that Combs was excluded from the meeting.",
      "Agnifilo emphasized the public nature of trials and wanted his objection on the record, adding that what they \"didn't consent to, and we don't, most respectfully, is that these events which play important parts in the background of some of the most critical events in the trial, should be in any way not fully public.\"",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyers requested that the names of anonymous witnesses in the mogul's sex crimes trial be made public. (Scott Dudelson/Getty Images)",
      "\"Part of the reason that trials are fully public is so if other people realize they know something about an event discussed in a public courtroom they can come forward and share their recollection about it,\" Agnifilo stated. \"And I think that is kind of the practical side of the constitutional right to a public trial; that it's public for a reason, and the facts are public for a reason, and the names are public for a reason. And that reason is so the public can do what the public does in all issues of importance, which is receive them, and if someone has something to add, that person can come forward and add whatever it is that person has to add.\"",
      "The prosecution argued the defense's suggestion regarding the use of real names was \"nothing more than a pretense to attempt to harass and intimidate\" Combs' ex-girlfriend, who testified this week under the pseudonym Jane.",
      "During her testimony, Jane told the jury about a secret Las Vegas trip she took in January 2024. Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend noted she traveled to see a very famous rapper who is close to Combs.",
      "The rapper is \"an icon in the music industry,\" according to Jane.",
      "Jane recalled that she and others attended a play before heading to a strip club, and then they went to a hotel room. Antoine \u2014 one of the male escorts Jane and Combs often turned to for alleged \"hotel nights\" \u2014 was part of the group. Jane said that she and Antoine greeted each other.",
      "Jane recalled watching Antoine have sex with a woman in front of others after she went to the hotel room. She told Combs\u2019 defense lawyer there was flirtatious banter between her and the rapper, but nothing happened between them.",
      "The prosecution and the defense engaged in a back and forth in court on Thursday. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "In late May, the defense had previously objected to Combs' former assistant \"Mia\" testifying under the pseudonym when she took the stand.",
      "On Thursday, Subramanian told both legal teams that his ruling had not changed.",
      "\"The idea that somehow public revelation of the details that we discussed would in any way\u2026 result in some kind of investigation that would bear on the actual charges raised is not a real concern,\" the judge said.",
      "Before the 55-year-old rapper's trial resumed on Thursday, lawyers representing Sean Combs and federal prosecutors engaged in a back and forth about naming individuals who were present at a \"hotel night\" that took place on Jan. 24, 2024. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Prosecutor Maurene Comey added, \"I will also note that the identity of the people who were on that particular event is not a defense to any of the conduct that Jane testified the defendant engaged in on June 18 and 19 of 2024. So it is extreme \u2014 its probative value is extremely minimal and has nothing to do, from our perspective certainly, with the defendant's guilt or innocence of the sex trafficking charges.\"",
      "Criminal defense attorney John W. Day, owner of the Santa Fe, New Mexico-based law practice John Day Law, agreed, telling Fox News Digital, \"The judge is right \u2014 there's no reason other than intimidation for trying to publicize the names of other people present at \u2018hotel nights,\u2019 since this is not part of any charged conduct. The defense's claim, that naming names will bring other witnesses out of the woodwork, ignores that anyone who would be a potential witness has been following this trial from the start.\"",
      "Sean Combs' ex-girlfriend Jane testified that the music mogul forced her to have sex with an escort after their alleged physical altercation. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "On Monday, Jane told the court about the incident that allegedly occurred on June 18 and 19. She claimed she and Combs got into a physical altercation after she confronted him about being with another woman. She told the jury that she pushed his head into a marble countertop and threw candles toward Combs out of anger, and then Combs allegedly attacked her.",
      "The rapper allegedly followed her into the master bedroom, bathroom and closet before she attempted to run for the front door.",

      "\"Sean kicked me from the back of my thigh, and then I fell down on my butt,\" Jane testified. \"And then he picked me up in a chokehold and choked me.\" Jane claimed she ran about six blocks away from the home and waited for approximately two hours before returning. Once home, she claimed the fight between her and Combs continued. As the fight turned physical, Jane recalled Combs punching her twice. She ran into the backyard and laid down in the grass, covering her face, head and body with her hands. Combs allegedly punched and kicked her \"several times\" while in this position before he dragged her back into the home.",

      "At this point, Combs allegedly came in and slapped her three times in the face. She said she lost her balance and fell over.",

      "Last month, Cassie Ventura, a singer who had a 12-year on-again, off-again romantic relationship with Combs, gave four days of testimony during the first week of the rapper's trial. The \"Me & U\" singer alleged that Combs forced her to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male escorts called \"freak-offs,\" which the Bad Boys Records founder filmed. She claimed that Combs used the recordings of the \"freak-offs\" to blackmail her.",

      "He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, in which witnesses have testified to alleged rape, sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor and drug trafficking. The trial is expected to wrap up by July 4.",

      "He told the court he felt bullied by another juror and refused to rejoin the discussions.",
      "The judge's declaration comes after Weinstein was convicted of one of the top charges but was acquitted of another. Both charges concerned accusations of forcing oral sex on women in 2006. Weinstein denied all charges.",

      "The final verdict comes after the jury delivered its partial verdict on June 11. (Michael Nagle/Pool Photo via AP)",
      "\"After eight years, dozens of accusers, and three trials, we are left with a single conviction \u2013 one we firmly believe will not stand, due to gross juror misconduct,\" Juda Engelmayer, a spokesperson for Weinstein, told Fox News Digital. \"Harvey is, of course, disappointed by the verdict, but he remains determined and resolute in his fight to clear his name.\"Jessica Mann, a hairstylist and actor, had accused Weinstein of a rape she allegedly endured in a Manhattan hotel room. Mann testified for days, as she did in 2020, about why she continued to see and have consensual encounters with Weinstein afterward.",

      "\"We take the wins where we get them - and the acquittal on the Sokola charge was a major one,\" Engelmayer, Weinstein's spokesperson, told Fox News Digital. \"A conviction there would have reset the sentencing clock entirely\u2026 This trial has raised substantial appellate issues\u2026\"",
      "Kaja Sokala, who testified Weinstein forcibly performed unwanted oral sex on her in 2006, told Fox News Digital the partial verdict was \"a painful reminder.\" Weinstein was acquitted on the charge stemming from Sokala's testimony.",

      "She continued, \"At the same time, this partial verdict is a painful reminder of how deeply ingrained victim-blaming still is in our justice system. The defense used ambush tactics designed to confuse and manipulate the jury, relying on outdated and dangerous myths about how survivors \"should\" behave. These tactics didn\u2019t erase the truth, but they distorted it just enough to deny full justice.\"",
      "\"A mistrial or not guilty verdict does not mean the harm didn\u2019t happen. It means the system is still failing to fully grasp the reality of trauma and the courage it takes to speak up. I am deeply grateful to the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office for their tireless work on this case, and for treating survivors with the respect and seriousness we deserve. Their commitment made this conviction possible,\" the statement concluded. \"I stand with Jessica, Miriam, and every survivor who testified with strength, clarity, and truth. This fight has never been about one verdict, it\u2019s about changing the culture that allowed this abuse to thrive. Today, we move forward. Tomorrow, we keep fighting.\"",

      "Before cross-examination continued Wednesday of Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who testified using the pseudonym \"Jane,\" the defense told Judge Arun Subramanian that they'd like to respond to the government's attempt to dismiss a Black juror from the case. The U.S. Attorney's Office allegedly told the court that while the situation was less than desirable, they were compelled to because of a lack of candor.",
      "The judge told the court he would rule on the issue if there was any basis for removing a juror and once the defense submitted a letter.",

      "\"Around this time, I just really wanted my partner to get sober,\" Jane testified. \"I just really cared so much about Sean's health, and I could see that he just, like, was excessively partying on top of just so many pills that he takes daily for I don't know what.

An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address.

The original botnet was briefly disrupted in Germany in 2024 when security researchers \"sinkholed\" the malware's command servers. That wiped out part of the operation, but not for long. Just a week later, the malware reappeared on nearly 200,000 devices, including more recognizable brands like Hisense smartphones and Yandex TVs.",

You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk.

Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",

      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "As part of Apple Intelligence, Apple announced the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT directly into system-wide features such as writing suggestions and Siri. When Siri encounters a question or task it can't handle, it can now request assistance from ChatGPT, but only after explicitly asking for the user's permission each time. Users can access ChatGPT within apps like Mail and Notes to generate summaries, compose replies or brainstorm content ideas on demand.",
      "This partnership marks the first time OpenAI's GPT-4o has been embedded into the Apple ecosystem for fallback AI tasks. The integration is tightly controlled and opt-in: Users must grant permission before any information is sent to ChatGPT, and Apple emphasizes robust privacy protections, including obscuring IP addresses and not sharing personal data unless a user connects their ChatGPT account.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Additionally, ChatGPT's capabilities extend to creative tools such as Image Playground, where users can generate images in new styles like oil painting or vector art, and to Visual Intelligence features, which allow users to ask ChatGPT about content on their screens or search for similar products and images. This integration is designed to enhance productivity and creativity while keeping user privacy at the forefront.",

      "New features under the Apple Intelligence banner include live translation across Messages, FaceTime and the Phone app, a capability Android users have had for several years. Apple also introduced Workout Buddy, a fitness tool that uses an AI-generated voice to provide spoken encouragement.

      "How the Atom Touch prosthetic arm uses AI and muscle signals",
      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",
      "AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",

      "Atom Touch stands out for several reasons. It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

Jason Morris, who lost his arm due to a work accident and is Atom Bodies' lead test user, notes that most prosthetics can only be worn for about two hours due to discomfort. Atom Touch is designed for initial wear of four to six hours, with the goal of achieving all-day use.

When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",

For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background.

      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time.

Many of them were issued before 1983 and lack basic security features, making them easier to forge or misuse.Rising identity theft risks: Your SSN is one of the most sensitive identifiers tied to your name.

Long lines at SSA offices and delays in mail processing have made it harder for people to get help quickly. A digital SSN provides faster, safer and more convenient access to your number when you need it.",

      "You\u2019ll need a\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account to use the digital SSN features. Here\u2019s how to get started:",
      "1) Visit the SSA\u2019s account portal: Go to\u00a0ssa.gov/myaccount and click \"Create an Account.\"",
      "2) Verify your identity: You\u2019ll be asked to provide your name, birthdate, SSN and address. The SSA may use a third-party identity verification service and ask questions based on your credit report.",
      "3) Choose a username and password: Use a strong, unique password and set up two-factor authentication with your phone number or an authenticator app. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Log in and check your dashboard: Once the digital SSN feature launches, you\u2019ll be able to view your number securely from your account on a mobile device or computer.",

      "Even with digital access making your SSN more convenient, it\u2019s still one of the most sensitive pieces of personal information you own. If your SSN falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to identity theft, credit fraud and even tax return scams. Here are the best ways to protect it:",
      "1) Use a strong password for your SSA account: Create a unique, complex password for your\u00a0\"My Social Security\"\u00a0account and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication. This ensures that even if someone guesses your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second verification step. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Avoid public Wi-Fi when accessing your SSN: If you're checking your SSA account, avoid doing so over unsecured networks like\u00a0public Wi-Fi. Use a secure home network or\u00a0VPN to encrypt your connection and protect your session from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing scams and use strong antivirus software: Scammers often pose as the SSA to trick you into revealing your SSN. Don\u2019t click links in unsolicited emails or texts and never give personal information unless you\u2019re sure the source is legitimate. Always go directly to\u00a0ssa.gov if in doubt.",

      "4) Monitor your credit and bank accounts and use an identity theft service: Staying on top of your financial activity is one of the most effective ways to catch identity theft early. That\u2019s where identity protection services come in. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A man looking over his Social Security information (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5) Check your credit reports: Make it a habit to review your credit reports regularly. Look for unfamiliar accounts, unauthorized inquiries or incorrect personal information. If something seems off, contact the credit bureau right away to dispute it.",
      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Starting this summer, the SSA will let you view your Social Security number online through your \"My Social Security\" account. It\u2019s a secure, convenient update that cuts down on lost cards and office visits. To use it safely, set up strong login credentials and two-factor authentication. And since your SSN remains a top target for identity thieves, now\u2019s the time to protect it with tools like a password manager, VPN, antivirus software and identity theft monitoring.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

Each jetpack is made to order, handcrafted and painted in the U.K. The\u00a02025 package starts at around $31,000, which is a jump from the original price, but it now includes a two-year warranty, a luxury hard case and a fast charger. For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

The process involves custom-fitting the harness to your size and selecting your preferred finish, all of which are handcrafted in the U.K. Due to this approach, there is typically a wait time before delivery, which varies depending on demand and the customization options.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",
      "As Robert from Danville asks, \"I constantly get in my spam junk folder emails saying 'someone has logged into your account.' Is this spam? legitimate? concerning? How do I know? How to avoid wasting time checking? How do I check?\"",

      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",

      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link.

      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

      "If you've received a text message claiming to be from your state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and threatening you with fines or penalties unless you pay up, you're not alone. A new wave of scam texts is sweeping across the country, targeting drivers in states like Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, Vermont, Texas, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C.",

      "These scam messages vary slightly depending on the state you're in, but they\u2019re generally structured in the same way. The text threatens consequences, such as credit score damage, revoked driving privileges, suspended vehicle registration or increased toll fees, if you do not pay the bill you have supposedly incurred. To make the message appear legit, the scammers often include a date for penalties to begin, a fake administrative code and a link that appears to be an official DMV website.",

These are two powerful psychological motivators that can send you into a panic since your driving privileges are at risk, or you're facing financial consequences. The aim is to get you to act hastily without pausing to verify the source.

      "If you receive a suspicious text message claiming to be from your state's DMV and demanding payment or personal information, follow these steps to protect yourself:",
      "1. Be skeptical of any message creating urgency or panic: Scammers rely on fear and urgency to trick you into acting without thinking. If a message pressures you to act immediately, that's a major red flag.",
      "2. Check for obvious red flags: Look for signs like strange sender addresses, awkward language, misspellings or links that don't match your state's official DMV website.",
      "3. Do not click any links or reply, and use strong antivirus software: Legitimate DMVs will not ask for payments, personal details or sensitive information via unsolicited text messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Verify directly with your DMV: If you're concerned the message might be real, contact your state's DMV using the official website or a trusted phone number. Never use the contact information provided in the suspicious text.",
      "5. Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service. These services work by submitting opt-out requests to data brokers that collect and sell your information, helping to reduce your digital footprint and making it harder for scammers to find your contact details.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Delete the message immediately and block the sender: Removing the text helps prevent accidental clicks and reduces the risk of falling for the scam later. Also, be sure to\u00a0block phone numbers and texts that send spam or scam messages, reducing future risk.",
      "7. Register your number with the\u00a0National Do Not Call Registry: While this won't stop all scams, it can help reduce unwanted communications.",
      "8. Don't provide any personal or financial information: Never share your Social Security number, driver's license number, banking information, or passwords in response to an unsolicited text.",
      "9. If you clicked the link or gave out information, act quickly: If you accidentally entered personal or financial information, contact your bank, credit card provider or local law enforcement right away to minimize potential damage.",
      "10. Keep your phone's security features updated: Ensure your\u00a0device's operating system and security software are current to help block known scam numbers and malicious links.",
      "11. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward the message to 7726 (SPAM) to alert your mobile provider and help block similar messages in the future. Mark the message as junk or spam within your messaging app, if possible. File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at\u00a0reportfraud.ftc.gov or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at\u00a0ic3.gov.",
      "DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT IN THE \"APPLE ID SUSPENDED\" PHISHING SCAM",

      "Scam texts pretending to be from the DMV are getting more convincing, but you don't have to be their next victim. Staying skeptical of urgent messages, double-checking anything that seems off and never clicking suspicious links can go a long way in protecting your personal information. Remember, the real DMV will never pressure you for payment or sensitive details over text. By staying alert, you can help prevent these scams and keep your personal information and money secure.",

      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",

      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age.

      "He had the sentence vacated in October by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which determined that it was based on calculations of a greater loss to his victims than was actually suffered\u00a0\u2014 and thus was too lengthy.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Selna on Thursday resentenced Avenatti to 135 months, minus 40 months already served for a separate Stormy Daniels case, for a new total of 95 months.",
      "Michael Avenatti had his sentence reduced on Thursday. (AP)",
      "MICHAEL AVENATTI TO PLEAD GUILTY IN REMAINING CRIMINAL CASES",
      "The new sentence will see Avenatti released in the middle of 2029.",
      "The court previously ruled that the Stormy Daniels case, where he stole money from her, was similar in nature, happened in the same time period and therefore could be considered when deciding the new sentence.",
      "The resentencing on Thursday took place with a heavy National Guard outside following riots in Los Angeles earlier this week. The doors of the courthouse were boarded up, and some windows had cracks apparently from rocks.",
      "The 14-year sentence was nullified, but not dismissed entirely, and his convictions still\u00a0stand, with Avenatti guilty of wire fraud and tax obstruction.",
      "Authorities said Avenatti negotiated and collected settlement payments on behalf of his clients, then funneled the money to accounts he controlled and spent it on his own lavish lifestyle.",
      "The case is separate from Avenatti's other convictions for attempting to extort Nike and stealing money from Daniels. Avenatti's attempts to get those convictions and sentences overturned on appeal all failed.",
      "The 14-year sentence was initially handed down after he pleaded guilty in 2022 to four counts of wire fraud and one count of obstructing IRS administration for stealing settlement money from multiple clients.",
      "It came despite Avenatti not reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors; he said he wanted to be accountable and spare his family further embarrassment.",
      "Avenatti\u2019s initial release date was set for July 31, 2035, but he asked Selna for a sentence that would have him released in just a few years.\u00a0Avenatti, who was suspended from practicing law in California, has been representing himself.",

      "DISGRACED LAWYER MICHAEL AVENATTI SEEKS MERCY AT RESENTENCING, CITING 'MODEL INMATE' RECORD",
      "Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of only a few months less than the 14 years originally handed down.",
      "Ahead of his resentencing, Avenatti appealed for a more lenient sentence by providing details of his alleged personal transformation\u00a0while behind bars in a 41-page memorandum filed last month.",
      "The memorandum detailed his life at the Terminal Island prison in Los Angeles, describing how he is trusted by prison officials to help other inmates \u2014 including serving as \"suicide watch companion.\"",
      "He also completed a\u00a0drug abuse program\u00a0and \"regularly attended AA meetings and religious services.\" Avenatti also volunteered in the prison library, assisting academically challenged inmates with legal matters, per the memorandum.",

      "\"Since his 2022 original sentencing, [Avenatti] has lived every day of his incarceration seeking to atone for the harm he caused and set his life on a different path,\" the filing reads.",
      "Daniels' case with Avenatti centered on a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) tied to an alleged affair between her and Trump, and the legality of a $130,000 hush money payment made shortly before the 2016 election.",

      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES 'OPERATION RISING LION' ON IRAN, TARGETING NUCLEAR FACILITIES, TEHRAN",
      "Their deaths came amid Israeli Defense Forces launched a sweeping\u00a0strike on\u00a0Iran, called \"Operation Rising Lion.\" It followed months of attempted, and seemingly failed, nuclear negotiations between the Trump administration and Tehran. Israel said it launched the strikes to target Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile infrastructure.",
      "Salami was the\u00a0commander-in-chief of the IRGC since his appointment in 2019 by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, overseeing Iran\u2019s elite military force.",
      "His appointment came shortly after President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization.",
      "Salami first joined the IRGC during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, rising through the ranks to lead the IRGC\u2019s air forces and later its entire command.",
      "The IRGC is one of the country\u2019s most powerful centers. It\u00a0was created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution and has evolved from a paramilitary, domestic security force into a transnational force that has come to the aid of Tehran\u2019s allies in the Middle East, from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq, per the Times of Israel.",
      "It operates in parallel to the country\u2019s existing armed forces. It controls Iran\u2019s arsenal of ballistic missiles, which it has used to attack Israel twice during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",

The Guard also maintains control over Iran\u2019s expansive ballistic missile arsenal, which has been deployed in strikes against Israel \u2014 most notably during the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 and serves as a central pillar of Iran\u2019s deterrence strategy.",
      "Salami was also known for his aggressive rhetoric toward both Israel and the United States, publicly calling for the destruction of Israel as early as 2016. After the U.S. killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of the IRGC\u2019s elite Quds Force, in a 2020 drone strike, Salami vowed retaliation. Just five days later, Iran launched ballistic missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq and warned that American and Israeli commanders would be targeted in future reprisals.",
      "In one of the most aggressive actions attributed to him, Salami ordered a massive retaliatory strike last year, launching more than 300 drones and missiles after Israel killed seven Iranian generals in an airstrike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria.",
      "Israel\u2019s\u00a0targeted attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile infrastructure early Friday took out several top Iranian generals; Gen.

      "He was a veteran of the\u00a01979 Islamic Revolution and held multiple senior roles in intelligence and strategic command.",
      "Bagheri was instrumental in shaping Iran\u2019s military doctrine and led efforts to modernize its missile and air defense systems. He represented Iran in military coordination with allies like Russia and Syria, particularly during joint operations in the Syrian Civil War.",
      "As the brain behind Iran\u2019s strategic military posture, Bagheri was on Israel\u2019s radar for years as a high-value target.",

      "Hajizadeh oversaw Iran's Aerospace Force, a powerful military branch responsible for its ballistic missile arsenal, drone programs and space-based military initiatives. He led the branch since 2009.",
      "The IDF said that Hajizadeh had gathered in an underground command center overnight with other senior officials to prepare for an attack on Israel when IAF fighter jets struck the location.",
      "The IDF said that the IRGC aerospace force was responsible for repeated attacks against Israeli civilians. Notably, Hajizadeh and his subordinates commanded Iran\u2019s direct missile and UAV attacks against Israel in October 2024 and direct missile strike in April 2024.",

      "\"Our mission has nothing to do with Hamas. It has nothing to do with Israel. It has everything to do with making sure that hungry Gazans get food. That is our singular mission. No other mission,\" Rev. Johnnie Moore, GHF's executive chairman, told Fox News Digital.",

Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher was a vocal critic, claiming the U.N. already had the infrastructure and ability to distribute aid.",
      "Moore, however, believes GHF is \"trying to solve a problem that the U.N. hasn\u2019t been able to solve,\" namely, the issue of Hamas stealing aid. Rather than admonish critics, Moore is urging them to join GHF\u2019s efforts to get food to people on the ground in Gaza.",
      "The GHF chief also noted that, despite what critics have said, Gazans have been \"incredibly grateful\" to receive the support. Not only have the beneficiaries been thanking the U.S., they\u2019ve been thanking President Donald Trump. Moore attributes this to a promise the commander in chief made in the Oval Office.",

      "Israel and the U.S. have repeatedly said that GHF is the best mechanism for distributing aid to Gazans and ensuring that Hamas does not get anything. Moore told Fox News Digital humanitarian aid officials have faced a \"false choice\" for years between Hamas and the people of Gaza.",
      "\"I think for many, many years, the aid community thought that the cost of giving aid to the people of Gaza is that you had to lose a certain amount of that aid to all of these other nefarious purposes. We're just showing that that's a false choice. That doesn't have to be the case. We can actually give aid without facing these dilemmas,\" Moore said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge presiding over Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s case ruled on Friday that the Trump administration can continue to detain the Columbia University activist.",
      "In his ruling on Friday, Michael Farbiarz of the U.S. District Court for New Jersey rejected Khalil's request for release. The judge wrote that Khalil can remain in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, as long as the detention is not based on a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the activist is a national security threat.",
      "\"To the extent the Petitioner requests relief from this Court, the request is denied,\" the judge said in his ruling.",
      "The ruling comes after Justice Department officials on Friday argued in a letter that while Khalil can\u2019t be detained based on Rubio\u2019s determination, according to the judge\u2019s ruling, he can be detained for other reasons. The officials cited immigration-related statutes.",
      "\u201cThe Court instead enjoined Respondents from detaining Khalil \u2018based on the Secretary of State\u2019s determination,\u2019\u2019 DOJ officials said in the letter. \u201cThat injunction does not interfere with Respondents\u2019 authority to detain Khalil on other grounds.\u201d",
      "Brett Max Kaufman, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Khalil, said that the move is an attempt from the Trump administration to \"delay justice for Mahmoud.\"",
      "\u201cThe government practically never holds people in detention on a charge like this, and it\u2019s clear that the government is doing anything they can to punish Mahmoud for his speech about Palestine,\" Kaufman said. \"We will not stop until he\u2019s home with his family.\u201d",
      "To justify Khalil\u2019s removal, Rubio released a memo in April, citing an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens if the secretary determines their presence in the country would result in \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "Rubio wrote in the memo that allowing Khalil, who led protests against the war on Gaza, to stay in the U.S. would create a \u201chostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\u201d",
      "But the judge, Michael Farbiarz of the U.S. District Court for New Jersey, ruled Wednesday that the foreign policy grounds for Khalil\u2019s detention are insufficient and likely unconstitutional. Farbiaz stayed the preliminary injunction until 9:30 a.m. Friday, giving the government time to appeal. And by Friday morning, Khalil\u2019s legal team filed a letter, requesting the court to order his release.",
      "\u201cThe Government has not  filed a notice of appeal of this Court\u2019s Order by the Court-ordered deadline for the preliminary injunction to be in effect,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Khalil, who grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and and was granted permanent U.S. resident status, became a widely recognized activist amid the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last year. In March, he was abruptly arrested outside his student housing on campus and detained before the Trump administration accused him of leading \u201cactivities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d Since then, his legal counsel has been challenging efforts to deport him. He has not been charged with any crime.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Khalil has acted to \u201cglorify and support terrorists.\u201d",
      "In a declaration filed last week, Khalil called the claims \u201cgrotesque and false.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese were not just attacks on my character; they were efforts to erase my humanity,\u201d Khalil said in the legal filing.",
      "Amid his three months in detention, Khalil also became a father and fought for contact with his newborn son, Deen. Khalil\u2019s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, gave birth in April. ICE previously rejected Khalil\u2019s request to attend his son\u2019s birth, court documents show.",
      "\u201cThe most immediate and visceral harms I have experienced directly relate to the birth of my son, Deen,\u201d Khalil said in the legal filing. \u201cInstead of holding my wife\u2019s hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention center floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she labored alone.\u201d",
      "ICE also denied a request last week for Khalil to be moved from Louisiana to a facility closer to his family, with no explanation, emails show. The agency\u2019s own policy requires detaining noncitizen parents or legal guardians, who are primary caretakers or have custody of minor children, in facilities close to their children.",
      "\u201cICE\u2019s directive recognizes that the government should have no role in destroying the family unit, and yet that is exactly what is happening here,\u201d said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which is part of Khalil\u2019s legal team.",
      "Khalil met his son for the first time last month, his attorneys said, just before an immigration hearing.",

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced on Friday.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, seems inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he has not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and a near permanent fixture in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United, before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English men's national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of 92,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. This culminated in the club winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League, and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four different countries.",
      "An elegant player, Beckham's intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the LA Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, currently home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants, and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

United put 26 of its crew members who were on layover in Israel on Israeli airline El Al to get back to the U.S., a spokesman said.",
      "El Al has since suspended service.",

      "Turkish Airlines and European budget carrier Wizz Air also suspended Israel flights. Germany\u2019s Lufthansa said it was suspending Tel Aviv and Tehran service until July 31 and flights to Jordan and Lebanon until at least June 20. Emirates said it was canceling service from its base in Dubai to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran.",

    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",
      "Alex Bruesewitz, a Republican consultant with close ties to the White House, shared Rubio\u2019s statement on X, emphasizing that the \u201cUS WAS NOT INVOLVED IN STRIKES AGAINST IRAN.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Laura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist aligned with Trump, posted several messages supportive of Trump and Israel.",
      "\u201cIran,\u201d Loomer wrote, \u201cmust never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Mehek Cooke, an attorney and pro-Trump political commentator active in the MAGA movement, said Friday that her recent visit to Israel opened her eyes to the \u201cdevastation of Iran\u2019s Oct. 7 proxy war\u201d there.",
      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",
      "Asked to explain the tension within the MAGA movement, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

      "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Caitlin Clark ended practice Friday by making a halfcourt shot and winning a little bit of lunch money in the process.",
      "And with that, the Indiana Fever star is ready to play again.",
      "Clark \u2014 barring any unforeseen setbacks \u2014 is expected to be in the lineup when the Fever play host to the reigning WNBA champion New York Liberty on Saturday afternoon. She missed the last five Indiana games with a quadriceps injury.",
      "\"As long as we don't have any regressions, she's going to be ready to roll,\" Fever coach Stephanie White said.",
      "Clark returned to practice this week, and her comeback game just happens to be a nationally televised one against the Liberty \u2014 the defending champs and, at 9-0, the last unbeaten team left in the league this season. New York is winning its games by an average of 19 points.",
      "\"I'm really excited,\" Clark said. \"I think it's definitely been a process. I think the hardest part is when you like begin to feel really good and then it's just a process of working yourself back into actually getting up and down and getting out there with my teammates.\"",
      "The halfcourt shot at the end of practice was the kicker of a friendly competition, and Clark (who says she rarely wins the halfcourt contests) did wave a few dollars that she won around afterward \u2014 in case anyone needed a reminder of her shooting range.",
      "The Fever (4-5) went 2-3 in Clark's absence. She was averaging 19 points, 9.3 assists, six rebounds and 1.3 steals per game when she got hurt. There's still a long way to go this season, but no player in WNBA history has ever finished a season averaging that many points, assists, rebounds and steals per game.",
      "Clark freely acknowledges that she's not a patient person, but she understood the process and why it was important to not skip any steps in her recovery. Among the treatments: \"anything under the sun,\" she said, including everything from massage to weights to hyperbaric therapy.",
      "\"It was certainly a learning opportunity, and I think it's going to benefit me a lot throughout my career, just falling back and understanding certain moments like this,\" Clark said. \"But I'm super, super excited. I'm antsy to get out there and probably shake off a little bit of rust and then play.\"",
      "Clark's return is the latest bit of big basketball news in Indianapolis, along with the Indiana Pacers going into Friday's Game 4 of the NBA Finals leading the Oklahoma City Thunder 2-1. Clark and many other Fever players were at Game 3 on Wednesday night at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the same court where they'll be taking on the Liberty on Saturday.",
      "Even though Clark and the Fever have an early game Saturday, some \u2014 Clark included \u2014 plan on at least seeing some of Game 4 on Friday night.",
      "\"It's incredible. It's incredible,\" White said when asked about the energy around basketball in Indianapolis right now. \"As someone who grew up in the state of Indiana and as the saying goes, 'This is Indiana.' And so, the energy's incredible. It's such a fun time to be in the city.\"",
      "The Fever are also expected to have guard Sophie Cunningham (ankle) back for the game against the Liberty on Saturday. Cunningham has averaged 6.5 points in four games so far this season.",
      "\"It's really reintegrating two of our top six players, right? Reintegrating them back into the system,\" White said. \"Some of the things that we run will look different than without Caitlin on the floor, certainly. Sophie's versatility and being able to play in multiple positions ... it is like starting Day 1 again.\""

      "\u201cConsumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed,\u201d Joanne Hsu, survey director, said in a statement. \u201cHowever, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy.\u201d",
      "To be sure, all of the sentiment indexes were still considerably below their year-ago readings as consumers worry about what impact the tariffs will have on prices, along with a host of other geopolitical concerns.",
      "On inflation, the one-year outlook tumbled from levels not seen since 1981.",
      "The one-year estimate slid to 5.1%, a 1.5 percentage point drop, while the five-year view edged lower to 4.1%, a 0.1 percentage point decrease.",
      "\u201cConsumers\u2019 fears about the potential impact of tariffs on future inflation have softened somewhat in June,\u201d Hsu said. \u201cStill, inflation expectations remain above readings seen throughout the second half of 2024, reflecting widespread beliefs that trade policy may still contribute to an increase in inflation in the year ahead.\u201d",
      "The Michigan survey, which will be updated at the end of the month, had been an outlier on inflation fears, with other sentiment and market indicators showing the outlook was fairly contained despite the tariff tensions. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve of New York reported that the one-year view had fallen to 3.2% in May, a 0.4 percentage point drop from the prior month.",
      "At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week reported that both producer and consumer prices increased just 0.1% on a monthly basis, pointing toward little upward pressure from the duties. Economists still largely expect the tariffs to show an impact in the coming months.",
      "The soft inflation numbers have led Trump and other White House officials to demand the Fed start lowering interest rates again. The central bank is slated to meet next week, with market expectations strongly pointing to no cuts until September.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge presiding over Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s case ruled on Friday that the Trump administration can continue to detain the Columbia University activist.",
      "In his ruling on Friday, Michael Farbiarz of the U.S. District Court for New Jersey rejected Khalil's request for release. The judge wrote that Khalil can remain in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, as long as the detention is not based on a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the activist is a national security threat.",
      "\"To the extent the Petitioner requests relief from this Court, the request is denied,\" the judge said in his ruling.",
      "The ruling comes after Justice Department officials on Friday argued in a letter that while Khalil can\u2019t be detained based on Rubio\u2019s determination, according to the judge\u2019s ruling, he can be detained for other reasons. The officials cited immigration-related statutes.",
      "\u201cThe Court instead enjoined Respondents from detaining Khalil \u2018based on the Secretary of State\u2019s determination,\u2019\u2019 DOJ officials said in the letter. \u201cThat injunction does not interfere with Respondents\u2019 authority to detain Khalil on other grounds.\u201d",
      "Brett Max Kaufman, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Khalil, said that the move is an attempt from the Trump administration to \"delay justice for Mahmoud.\"",
      "\u201cThe government practically never holds people in detention on a charge like this, and it\u2019s clear that the government is doing anything they can to punish Mahmoud for his speech about Palestine,\" Kaufman said. \"We will not stop until he\u2019s home with his family.\u201d",
      "To justify Khalil\u2019s removal, Rubio released a memo in April, citing an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens if the secretary determines their presence in the country would result in \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "Rubio wrote in the memo that allowing Khalil, who led protests against the war on Gaza, to stay in the U.S. would create a \u201chostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\u201d",
      "But the judge, Michael Farbiarz of the U.S. District Court for New Jersey, ruled Wednesday that the foreign policy grounds for Khalil\u2019s detention are insufficient and likely unconstitutional. Farbiaz stayed the preliminary injunction until 9:30 a.m. Friday, giving the government time to appeal. And by Friday morning, Khalil\u2019s legal team filed a letter, requesting the court to order his release.",
      "\u201cThe Government has not  filed a notice of appeal of this Court\u2019s Order by the Court-ordered deadline for the preliminary injunction to be in effect,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Khalil, who grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria and and was granted permanent U.S. resident status, became a widely recognized activist amid the pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University last year. In March, he was abruptly arrested outside his student housing on campus and detained before the Trump administration accused him of leading \u201cactivities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d Since then, his legal counsel has been challenging efforts to deport him. He has not been charged with any crime.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Khalil has acted to \u201cglorify and support terrorists.\u201d",
      "In a declaration filed last week, Khalil called the claims \u201cgrotesque and false.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese were not just attacks on my character; they were efforts to erase my humanity,\u201d Khalil said in the legal filing.",
      "Amid his three months in detention, Khalil also became a father and fought for contact with his newborn son, Deen. Khalil\u2019s wife, Dr. Noor Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, gave birth in April. ICE previously rejected Khalil\u2019s request to attend his son\u2019s birth, court documents show.",
      "\u201cThe most immediate and visceral harms I have experienced directly relate to the birth of my son, Deen,\u201d Khalil said in the legal filing. \u201cInstead of holding my wife\u2019s hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention center floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she labored alone.\u201d",
      "ICE also denied a request last week for Khalil to be moved from Louisiana to a facility closer to his family, with no explanation, emails show. The agency\u2019s own policy requires detaining noncitizen parents or legal guardians, who are primary caretakers or have custody of minor children, in facilities close to their children.",
      "\u201cICE\u2019s directive recognizes that the government should have no role in destroying the family unit, and yet that is exactly what is happening here,\u201d said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, which is part of Khalil\u2019s legal team.",
      "Khalil met his son for the first time last month, his attorneys said, just before an immigration hearing.",
      "Khalil has drawn widespread support from pro-Palestinian activists nd free speech advocates, with his arrest and detention prompting protests across the country. Most recently, several celebrities who are also fathers, including comedian Mo Amer, actors Mark Ruffalo and Mahershala Ali and \u201cRage Against The Machine\u201d guitarist Tom Morello, came together to read a letter that Khalil wrote to his son ahead of Father\u2019s Day on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI am a Palestinian refugee, asylee to America, became a citizen in 2009, and in 2023 I had a son,\u201d Amer said. \u201cMahmoud\u2019s letter is like a dagger to the heart, and that\u2019s why I am doing this.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced on Friday.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, seems inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he has not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and a near permanent fixture in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United, before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English men's national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of 92,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. This culminated in the club winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League, and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four different countries.",
      "An elegant player, Beckham's intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the LA Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, currently home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants, and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "This love triangle was not a part of Song\u2019s own time as a matchmaker, though other moments in the film do come from her past. An ending courthouse wedding scene was inspired by her own civil ceremony with husband and \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes.",
      "\u201cI got married at the courthouse first,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a party after.\u201d",
      "Song ultimately decided to call it quits as a matchmaker, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t writing, because it was too fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was supposed to be a day job and it was becoming like my full time thing ... I only did it for six months but some of them resulted in a second date, which is a win.\u201d",
      "When it comes to drawing inspiration from her personal experiences for her work, Song says it has to teach her something and \u201cit always has to be something that fascinates me.\u201d",
      "\u201cOr something that makes me feel like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know enough about that,\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cThe story has to feel like it knows more than me, is wiser than me, and it\u2019s better than me in that way.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaterialists\u201d asks: Is love easy? Is checking the boxes better than a real connection? Does being taller make you a better catch, among other measurable features.",
      "There\u2019s a scene in \u201cMaterialists\u201d when Lucy is talking to her co-worker about a surgery that can make a person taller. The two matchmakers candidly speak about the benefits of such procedure when it comes to finding a partner.",
      "Later on, Lucy discovers that Harry actually had the surgery and added six inches to his height. He admits that after the procedure, his whole life changed and more women became interested in him.",

The standards, numbers like height, all of that,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhat Harry is going through is very difficult as well, and I\u2019m really interested in depicting men fairly.\u201d",
      "The idea of a \u201cunicorn,\u201d a rare and nearly perfect candidate, is also a product of the materialistic world, Song says. She hopes male viewers can relate.",
      "\u201cSo often the topics of romance are reduced to girl s---,\u201d she says, adding that matters of the heart are not just for women. \u201cThe truth is, men are also crushed by the dating market. They\u2019re also crushed by the way that we date and with the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves and each other.

      "\u201cBut it\u2019s also hard when people are afraid to let go of control and completely surrender,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut the truth is, I think, when it happens, it just happens. They say, \u2018If you know, you know.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of what it is. You face it, and then when you face love, it\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s very easy.\u201d"

      "The detainees were being held at the Delaney Hall facility in Newark, where Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been holding individuals who are facing possible deportation. The four people were unaccounted for Thursday night, and federal authorities were looking into whether they were still on the grounds of the facility or had somehow escaped, senior officials said.",
      "\u201cDHS has become aware of 4 detainees at the privately held Delaney Hall Detention facility escaping,\u201d according to a statement from the agency. \u201cAdditional law enforcement partners have been brought in to find these escapees.\u201d It added that an alert had been made to area law enforcement and encouraged the public to call 911 or the ICE tip line if they had relevant information.",
      "DHS and the FBI are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to their arrest. They are deemed \"public safety threats\" by the agency, which identified the four men as Franklin Norberto Bautista-Reyes, Joel Enrique Sandoval-Lopez, Joan Sebastian Castaneda-Lozada and Andres Pineda-Mogollon. They are from Honduras and Colombia, and each had previously been arrested in New Jersey based on different reasons.",
      "The GEO Group, which is the private company that runs the facility, said that it was working with ICE to find the men.",
      "\"The safety and security of the Delaney Hall Facility and our neighbors in the local community is our top priority,\" a spokesperson for the company said in a statement. \"Contrary to current reporting, there has been no widespread unrest at the Facility.\"",
      "The wife of one detainee told NBC New York she rushed over to Delaney Hall after she got a call from her husband about a lockdown in his pod and a protest about inhumane conditions at the detention center. She said she was worried about her husband\u2019s safety.",
      "Local and state authorities were notified of the missing detainees, and some additional resources were called in to assist with the situation, according to the senior officials.",

      "By law, members of Congress are authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill that spelled out the authority.",
      "McIver said in a statement that she had \u201cserious concerns about the reports of abusive circumstances at the facility,\u201d and that her office had reached out to ICE for answers.",
      "At the same visit that resulted in McIver\u2019s charges, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge, which was later dropped. Baraka later filed a lawsuit against acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba over what he said was a malicious prosecution.",
      "In a statement, Baraka expressed concern for what had transpired at Delaney Hall on Thursday, \u201cranging from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.\u201d",
      "The mayor went on to say the situation \u201clacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail \u2014 including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights. This is why city officials and our congressional delegation need to be allowed entry to observe and monitor, any why private prisons pose a very real problem to our state and its constitution...We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked.\u201d"

      "Trump has denied Leeds\u2019 and Stoynoff\u2019s claims.",
      "In seeking to overturn the $83.3 million verdict, Trump argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last July providing him substantial criminal immunity shields him from liability in Carroll\u2019s civil case.",
      "The verdict included $18.3 million of damages for emotional and reputational harm, and $65 million of punitive damages."

    "summary": "Bryan Cranston opens up about how he curates his roles, his work ethic and the advice he doesn't give his daughter, \"The Pitt\" star Taylor Dearden.",
    "story": [
      "If you stand still too long, people will peg you \u2014 at least according to Bryan Cranston. \u201cI like to keep people guessing,\u201d he tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview.",
      "That\u2019s why the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor says he prefers to \u201ckeep moving around\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m playing a lot of dramatic roles recently, I will look for comedic roles and I keep swimming back and forth so that I\u2019m not pegged as any given one person,\u201d he says.",
      "It\u2019s that versatility that\u2019s earned Cranston six Emmy Awards, two Tonys, a best actor Oscar nomination and a host of other accolades. And, at 69, he shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.",
      "Cranston currently appears in the latest Wes Anderson film, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d along with starring in \u201cEverything\u2019s Going to Be Great,\u201d a new drama for which Cranston learned how to play the bagpipes. If that\u2019s not enough, he\u2019ll soon be crossing the Atlantic to perform on London\u2019s famed West End in the Arthur Miller play \u201cAll My Sons,\u201d starting in November.",
      "\u201cI do love it. I have a relationship with this,\u201d explains Cranston. \u201cIt takes a committed relationship, that you\u2019re committing to this as your life, just like you would in your personal life. And if you do so, you have a chance to be successful in your personal life or your business life.\u201d",
      "No stranger to success, Cranston got his start doing bit parts in a variety of TV shows and movies before landing the breakout role of Hal Wilkerson in \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d in 2000. It's a role that earned him a handful of Emmy nominations and made Cranston a household name.",
      "However, it was the brief part he played in a 1998 episode of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d that put Cranston on the radar of one of the show\u2019s writers, Vince Gilligan. Eight years later, when Gilligan went to cast Walter White in his new antihero show, \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d he remembered Cranston and rang up the actor\u2019s agent. That decision would forever cement their legacies in television history.",
      "'You\u2019re Only as Good as You Dare to Be Bad'",
      "With a storied career in film, stage and television (both behind and in front of the camera), Cranston says he continues to seek out unique roles and opportunities that speak to him on a personal level.",
      "\u201cMy real life is filled with a variety of different characters. I\u2019m sometimes sincere, sometimes silly, sometimes moody, sometimes romantic ... and so there are different facets of ourselves that you are familiar with in your own life. Sometimes you\u2019re sad, sometimes you\u2019re joyous,\u201d explains Cranston.",
      "\u201cSo, I curate the roles I do. I look for roles that I can be different or something that challenges me that, 'Ooh, that\u2019s really not like me at all,' so I need to dive into that and see what comes of it,\u201d he says.",
      "In fact, it\u2019s his willingness to take risks that\u2019s gotten him this far, and it\u2019s based on advice he once received. Though Cranston can\u2019t quite remember exactly where he got it from, he says that outside of being kind, working hard and showing up on time, it's the best advice he's ever gotten.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re only as good as you dare to be bad, right? If you take chances that you could fall on your face, you could fail, it\u2019s that point that you can also turn and have it really work. So, don\u2019t play safe. Extend yourself, take chances, take risks and see what happens,\u201d Cranston tells TODAY.com.",
      "Is that the advice he gives his daughter, actor Taylor Dearden?",
      "\u201cFirst of all, as her dad, she does not want my direct advice,\u201d he says with a laugh about Dearden, whom he shares with wife Robin Dearden. The 32-year-old currently stars in the Max hospital drama \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d a role for which she\u2019s garnered glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cTaylor is a wonderful, hardworking actor,\u201d Cranston told Craig Melvin during a recent segment on TODAY. \u201cShe grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\u201d",
      "\u2018I Need to Outwork Everyone\u2019",
      "While Cranston may not dole out much career advice to Dearden, he tells TODAY.com that he does what he can to be a solid role model instead.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can relay to her is how I have been for her 32 years on this planet and try to live a good life and be an exemplar to her, as she can look at and say, \u2018Well, this is how he did things and that seemed to work for him.\u2019 Or, \u2018Oh, he tried that and that didn\u2019t work, so I\u2019m going to do something different,\u2019\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s basically it. Just live a true life and let your kids see that and hopefully they\u2019ll make their own proper decisions.\u201d",
      "That mindset likely comes from his parents, who Cranston says were instrumental in instilling his own work ethic.",
      "\u201cBoth my mother and father were hardworking people and they came from very humble, hardworking families, (they were) children during the Depression. It was, go out there every single day, try to find a job. That\u2019s what their parents were faced with. And so it carries on,\u201d says Cranston.",
      "With his parents as his example, Cranston says he learned early on that if he wanted to make a career out of acting, he needed to be fully committed.",
      "\u201cI realized as a young actor that there were always going to be actors who were better than me. At the same time, there were always going to be actors who weren\u2019t as good as me. And the only thing I can control is how hard I worked,\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cI know I can outwork people and that was my motto \u2014 I need to outwork everyone. So when I was a young actor, 22, 23, people were going out and they were partying every night. Not me. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to class. I\u2019m studying. I\u2019m learning monologues because I need to outwork everybody and I need to be ready.\u2019 And that was it, because this is what I wanted. I wanted a career as an actor.\u201d",
      "And it\u2019s that advice that Cranston passes along to young actors hoping to follow in his footsteps.",
      "\u201cI say, \u2018You\u2019ve got to commit.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018You\u2019re all in, go all in.\u2019 Because if you\u2019re not putting all of your energy into it, what are you waiting for? Why would you not? You've got to. And it still doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be successful, just like a personal life. But you\u2019ve got to try, and that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d"

      "When Celine Song wrote the script for her debut feature film, \u201cPast Lives,\u201d she was inspired by a conversation she had at a New York bar with her husband and her childhood sweetheart, who was visiting from South Korea.",
      "While translating between Korean and English for these important men in her life, she discovered that she was also translating \u201ctwo parts of myself,\u201d Song explained in an interview with BAFTA.",

      "So when it came to her latest romantic comedy, \u201cMaterialists,\u201d Song once again took inspiration from her personal life.",
      "As an aspiring playwright in New York City, Song didn\u2019t have the experience to work as a barista or in retail. Instead, after meeting a matchmaker at a party, she applied for the same position.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, maybe I\u2019ll try to get that job,\u2019\u201d Song tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd then I worked on it for like, six months. But I feel like I learned more about human beings in those six months than I did in any other part of my life. And in fact, it become kind of a big part of what I know about people too.\u201d",
      "Years later, those six months would eventually lead to her second feature film starring Dakota Johnson as Lucy, a high-end New York matchmaker who attempts to set up her rich and successful clients with other elite bachelors and bachelorettes. She's good at her job, which has led to nine successful marriages.",
      "However, Lucy's approach to having someone find their happily ever after is determined by math, calculations and numbers. When Lucy asks who her clients want to be buried next to and change their diapers when they grow old, her clients tell her the weight, height, salary and age range they want in a partner, focusing on the material aspects.",
      "At first it appears as if these marriages aren't based on happiness and how another person makes you feel. These are business transactions and what each person brings to the table.",
      "Lucy, on her end, also considers herself a professional \u2014 cold at times, and practical. At a wedding, she meets Harry (Pedro Pascal), a tall, handsome and extremely rich businessman who is very interested in her. At that same wedding, she runs into her ex-boyfriend John (Chris Evans), a struggling cater waiter and aspiring actor.",
      "Flashbacks show that Lucy and Chris, despite having a strong bond, had called it quits over financial issues.",

      "This love triangle was not a part of Song\u2019s own time as a matchmaker, though other moments in the film do come from her past. An ending courthouse wedding scene was inspired by her own civil ceremony with husband and \u201cChallengers\u201d screenwriter Justin Kuritzkes.",
      "\u201cI got married at the courthouse first,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a party after.\u201d",

I only did it for six months but some of them resulted in a second date, which is a win.\u201d",
      "When it comes to drawing inspiration from her personal experiences for her work, Song says it has to teach her something and \u201cit always has to be something that fascinates me.\u201d",
      "\u201cOr something that makes me feel like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know enough about that,\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cThe story has to feel like it knows more than me, is wiser than me, and it\u2019s better than me in that way.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaterialists\u201d asks: Is love easy? Is checking the boxes better than a real connection? Does being taller make you a better catch, among other measurable features.",

      "Later on, Lucy discovers that Harry actually had the surgery and added six inches to his height. He admits that after the procedure, his whole life changed and more women became interested in him.",
      "While the audience laughed in the screening I attended during those moments, Song calls it \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d",

      "The idea of a \u201cunicorn,\u201d a rare and nearly perfect candidate, is also a product of the materialistic world, Song says. She hopes male viewers can relate.",
      "\u201cSo often the topics of romance are reduced to girl s---,\u201d she says, adding that matters of the heart are not just for women. \u201cThe truth is, men are also crushed by the dating market. They\u2019re also crushed by the way that we date and with the way that we objectify and commodify ourselves and each other. I really wanted there to be a very real consequence for men in the film, and have them be crushed by the same dating market that crushes (Lucy's client) Sophie or Lucy.\u201d",
      "Song hopes \u201cMaterialists\u201d start an open-hearted and honest conversation about what it\u2019s like to date and love in 2025.",

They say, \u2018If you know, you know.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of what it is. You face it, and then when you face love, it\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s very easy.\u201d"

      "Vera Jayne Palmer, born April 19, 1933, was the only child of Herbert and Vera Palmer. At the age of 3, she was inside a vehicle with her mother and father when her dad experienced a heart attack and died while driving. She took the last name Peers when her mother remarried in 1939, according to the Texas State Historical Association. It would be a decade after that before young Vera went by the name that followed her into film.",

      "Mansfield welcomed her second child, son Mickey Hargitay Jr., in 1958. He was one of three children Mansfield gave birth to during her marriage to her second husband. Their other son, Zoltan Hargitay, was born in 1960. They celebrated the arrival of daughter Mariska in 1964.",

      "As it turns out, Walters had a profound impact on Winfrey\u2019s personal life, too. Winfrey reveals in the documentary that Walters played a part in her decision not to have children.",
      "Walters was a trailblazing journalist who entered the news business at a time when few women were a part of it. She got her start on TODAY in the 1960s, but eventually landed a long-term spot on ABC\u2019s news team, becoming a celebrity herself thanks to her insightful, often pointed, interviews.",
      "Walters, who earned multiple Daytime Emmys for her work on TODAY and \u201cThe View,\u201d married three different men over the course of her life. In 1968, she and her second husband, Lee Guber, adopted a daughter, Jacqueline, with whom she had a tempestuous relationship. Walters died in 2022 at the age of 93.",
      "Walters' life story in the ABC News Studios documentary, which is sprinkled throughout with new interviews from prominent news figures like Winfrey, Katie Couric, Connie Chung and Cynthia McFadden, is mainly told in her own words through old clips.",
      "\u201cI was in my 30s when Jackie was born,\u201d Walters says. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s a blessing. My world came together. I mean, I was already on the TODAY show, and I'd had three miscarriages, and now I had everything.\u201d",
      "Winfrey ties her own ascent as a journalist to watching what Walters did first.",
      "\u201cShe was a mentor for me before she knew that she was a mentor,\u201d Winfrey says in the film while describing watching Walters on television growing up.",
      "Walters' interviewing style inspired Winfrey, who explains she would look down at her question cards, and then up again at her subject to ask the next question, just like Walters.",
      "Winfrey later reflects on Walters' \u201ccharged, complex relationship\u201d with Jacqueline and its influence on her.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why I never had children,\u201d Winfrey says. \u201cI remember her telling me once that \u2018there\u2019s nothing more fulfilling than having children, and you should really think about it.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018OK, but I\u2019m looking at you. So, no.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jacqueline struggled with her mother's fame and ran away at one point when she was about 16. In old interview footage, Walters recalls having someone else pick up her daughter after learning where she ended up, and taking Jacqueline to an \u201cemotional growth school,\u201d where she remained for three years. She also says  Jacqueline had a problem with pills.",
      "\u201cIt's important to say Jackie had a father, and Jackie had a governess,\u201d McFadden, who is also adopted and conducted an interview in 2001 with Jacqueline at Walters' request, says. \u201cSo it wasn't that Jackie was left alone in a playpen. Barbara articulated many times that she had made mistakes as a mother. She had made choices for herself, for her work.\u201d",
      "Despite the struggle with work-life balance, Walters embraced being a mother from the beginning.",
      "Footage from an interview she did in the 1970s with Dolly Parton, who also does not have kids, shows the singer asking during a break if Walters only has one child. Walters responds that her daughter is adopted and says, \u201cFor me, it was the best thing I ever did.\u201d",
      "Later in the documentary, Winfrey goes into greater depth about how focusing on her career was also a stumbling block to having a family, much like Walters.",
      "\u201cYou are a pioneer in your field, and you are trying to break the mold for yourself and for women who are going to follow you, then something is going to have to give for that,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd that is why I did not have children. I knew I could not do both well. Both are sacrifices: Sacrifice to do the work, and it's also a sacrifice to be the mother and to say, \u2018No, let somebody else have that.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd at no time have I ever heard a story, read a story, and based on what I know of Barbara Walters, at no time, has Barbara Walters ever said, \u2018No, let someone else take that story.\u2019 No.\u201d",

      "Here's what to know about the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "What is the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "The cover art is immediately provocative. In the photo, Carpenter kneels on all fours wearing a tight black dress. Her hand rests on a man's leg. His hand, meanwhile, holds a chunk of her blond hair. Carpenter stares at the camera with an open-mouthed expression.",
      "On Instagram, Carpenter shared another image: A closeup of a dog wearing a collar with the words \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "She captioned the post, \"My new album, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend' \ud83d\udc3e is out on August 29, 2025. I can\u2019t wait for it to be yours xPre-order now.\"",
      "What are fans saying about the art?",
      "The art has gotten mixed reactions from fans, as evidenced by the comments on the original post and multiple Reddit threads.",
      "In the comments of Carpenter's post, people used words like \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the imagery, saying it was \"not a very empowering image for women.\" Another told her to \"please please please stand UP.\"",
      "Others tried to read into image's connection to the album's title and found a deeper meaning.",
      "\"Man\u2019s best friend double meaning for dogs and female dogs are b---hes so it\u2019s a play on the ideology of men being so dependent on women,\" one commenter said. \"Her cover shows her being in a submissive role but in reality she\u2019s the one who has actual control.\"",
      "Commenters debated back-and-forth. One said they were getting \"secondhand embarrassment\" by looking at the picture. Another responded, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to embarrass women but rather to show how women are regarded by certain men.\"",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Carpenter's reps for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "What is Sabrina Carpenter trying to say? A PR expert breaks it down",
      "Beth Booker, public perception expert and creator of \"The Uncensored Publicist,\" says the artwork should be situated within Carpenter's own brand and the way female pop stars are often marketed.",
      "The image is a familiar one at first: A \u201cfemale pop star posed and packaged perfectly for the male gaze,\" Booker says, comparing it to Britney Spears in the early 2000s or Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" era.",
      "However, Booker sees this as Carpenter \"flipping the script\" on a familiar format. Since humor is such a \"huge part of her brand,\" she says this should be interpreted with a wink.",
      "\"The cover is hypersexualized, yes, but intentionally exaggerated to feel almost absurd,\" she says. \"She\u2019s sexy, but she\u2019s also funny, self-aware, and in complete control of how she\u2019s being seen.\"",
      "Booker says that Carpenter's submissive posture in the photo is not an indication she's like that in real life.",
      "\"She\u2019s not performing desire for someone else\u2019s approval, she\u2019s expressing it for herself and her audience. The title, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend,' directly nods to how women have been labeled 'b-----s' for decades and she\u2019s essentially saying: fine, I\u2019ll take the word, flip it, and turn it into part of my brand,\" Booker says.",
      "Fans are debating Carpenter's intentions, which Booker says may have been Carpenter's intention.",
      "\"That confusion is the point. Great pop culture lives in that gray area where people aren\u2019t quite sure how they\u2019re supposed to feel. Is it satire? Is it sexy? The answer is yes. She knows exactly how this image would land and she\u2019s allowing people to sit in that tension because that\u2019s what keeps the conversation going. She\u2019s not being provocative accidentally, she\u2019s doing it on her own terms,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some people, even some of her own fans, are uncomfortable with it actually reinforces the point. Brand evolution doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable in real time, and that\u2019s part of what makes this moment important for her career.\u201d",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is Carpenter's seventh studio album and it'll follow the release of \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her sixth studio album, which won pop album of the year at the 2025 Grammys."

      "Gonzalez met Johnson on the hit Netflix dating series, which aired in 2023. She shared the news of their separation on the official \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d podcast hosted by fellow alum Amber Desiree \u201cA.D.\u201d Smith.",
      "In the latest episode of \u201cWhat\u2019s the Reality?\u201d uploaded June 11, Gonzalez detailed the breakdown of her relationship, revealing that problems with Johnson first arose six months after they said \u201cI do.\u201d",
      "The 33-year-old geologist and Johnson, a petroleum engineer seven years her junior, were the only couple on Season 5 who tied the knot and appeared happily together at the reunion episode in October 2023.",
      "But during her conversation with Smith \u2014 which she confirmed Johnson was not aware of \u2014 Gonzalez said that the criticism the two received during their season about their lack of compatibility turned out to be accurate.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m ready to speak my truth,\u201d she began at the start of the nearly hour-long podcast episode. \u201cThis is not a session to bash anybody. But I wanted to share with the world. I\u2019ve been quiet for too long, not necessarily because I didn\u2019t have anything to speak of. More because I wasn\u2019t ready for other people\u2019s opinions and judgment. And now I\u2019m ready, and I have decided that I filed divorce against Milton.\u201d",
      "She said Johnson refused to sign divorce papers unless she also signed an NDA. TODAY.com has reached out to Johnson for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "\"That said enough for me to know that I needed to share my truth and my experience because I\u2019ve been suffering in silence,\" she said.",
      "She said she couldn\u2019t point to one reason for their separation because there was \u201ca layer of situations\u201d that made her reach her breaking point.",
      "The reality television star went on to explain when their relationship started to unravel after a \u201cfairy tale\u201d start. She recalled them having their first argument after she learned Johnson had remained in contact with one of his exes following their nuptials.",
      "\u201cWhen I saw that, my heart went to the floor. I felt, like, betrayed and disrespected,\u201d she told Smith.",
      "The two went to couples therapy, but she said it didn\u2019t feel helpful. Still, she attempted to forgive, forget and move on.",
      "They later had a second wedding ceremony in Puerto Rico, where Gonzalez was raised. While in their hotel room, she looked through Johnson\u2019s phone, again, and saw that he was still communicating with his ex. She added that it took a year before he cut off communication with his past girlfriend.",
      "Gonzalez shared other interactions that led to their breakup. According to Gonzalez, Johnson felt she \u201cdisrespected him\u201d by wearing certain swimsuits, she said. He also would \u201cscold\u201d her in front of his family if she cursed.",
      "\u201cI just started feeling like I was losing my spark,\u201d she shared. \u201cIt was just things like that kept, like, making me feel small.\u201d",
      "Smith asked if their age gap, which was frequently mentioned during their time on \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d played a role in the tension between them.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the age gap. I don\u2019t think it was the numbers,\u201d Gonzalez replied. \u201cI think it was a matter of emotional availability and maturity, support and communication. Maybe the internet was right. Maybe he wasn\u2019t ready for marriage. I think he wanted to be ready for marriage, but I don\u2019t really think that he was ready to be a husband.\u201d",
      "Her recent health problems led to arguments, as well. Gonzalez shared that in September 2024 she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. According to the National Institute of Health, fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that causes pain throughout the body and also fatigue.",
      "\u201cIt kind of felt (like) relief. But at the same time, a life sentence,\u201d she explained. \u201cTo say that fibromyalgia has ruined my life doesn\u2019t even come near to it.\u201d",
      "She became emotional as she spoke about Johnson not being supportive after she was diagnosed. Gonzalez said she wanted to take a medical leave of absence from her job to focus on her health, but he disagreed.",
      "When Smith inquired about the current status of their relationship, Gonzalez described it as \u201cnonexistent\u201d since she filed for divorce on March 31.",
      "\u201cI never felt that my marriage was a priority for him,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she wanted to publicly address the split since social media users are invested in their relationship.",
      "\u201cI suffered so long in silence that my healing is going to be loud and profound,\u201d she added.",
      "In addition to the podcast, Gonzalez also penned a lengthy Instagram caption further explaining her decision to call it quits. The post included clips of sweet moments the couple shared together. It was her first social media post featuring Johnson since February.",
      "At the end of the caption, she wrote, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change our marriage for anything, forever you have taken a piece of my heart with you, I loved you beyond the beyond, and for me Love will always be blind.\u201d",
      "Johnson has not commented about the divorce on social media. He also hasn\u2019t posted on Instagram since February 2024. His last post was a Valentine\u2019s Day tribute that featured pictures from a photoshoot with Gonzalez.",
      "The news of Johnson and Gonzalez\u2019s divorce comes a few weeks after Season 3 couple Colleen Reed and Matt Bolton shared they have broken up, too.",
      "Reed and Bolton, who were married for nearly four years, released a joint statement on Instagram May 23 about their split.",
      "\u201cHi everyone, we wanted to share something personal, and this is not easy to do, but after nearly four years together, we\u2019ve decided to end our marriage and move forward on our own paths,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been separated for some time now and have been doing our best to work through everything privately and with care.\u201d",
      "They continued, \u201cThis was an incredibly difficult decision, not one we made lightly. It came with a lot of thought and it\u2019s been an emotional process for both of us.\u201d",
      "Bolton and Reed said they were grateful for their relationship and wouldn\u2019t change anything. They ended their statement by thanking everyone who has supported their love story."

      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose aid delivery has been mired in controversy and violence, said in a statement that more than two dozen of its employees were traveling by bus to a distribution center west of the southern city of Khan Younis when it was \u201cbrutally attacked by Hamas\u201d around 10 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET), leaving at least five people dead and multiple others injured.",
      "The foundation said there was also \u201cfear that some of our team members may have been taken hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cDespite this heinous attack, we will continue our mission to provide critical aid to the people of Gaza,\u201d it said.",
      "Hamas has not responded to the allegations and NBC News was unable to independently verify them.",
      "The GHF, which said it had been threatened by Hamas in recent days, began distributing aid in Gaza after Israel in mid-May eased its three-month total blockade on all supplies into the enclave, including food, medicine and other vital items, following an international outcry and warnings of famine from United Nations food experts.",
      "Despite the apparent loosening of the blockade, it is mostly the GHF that has been allowed to distribute aid \u2014 partly because it is supported by Israel and the U.S., which has raised doubts over its independence.",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore has declined to reveal the organization\u2019s sources of funding.",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he told NBC News in an exclusive interview.",
      "\u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans,\u201d said Moore, an evangelical Christian and former adviser to President Donald Trump who was appointed last week after his predecessor resigned citing \u201chumanitarian principles.\u201d",
      "Scrutiny of GHF has intensified in the past week as dozens of Palestinians were killed in and around its multiple aid sites in Gaza, which are in military zones and off-limits to independent media.",
      "Dr. Munir al-Barsh, director-general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said 39 Palestinians had been shot and killed Wednesday as they sought aid from GHF.",
      "\u201cAid distribution sites have become death traps in the Gaza Strip,\u201d he said.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and about 1,500 have been injured in shootings near GHF sites, according to the health ministry, whose numbers are considered credible by the World Health Organization.",
      "While the GHF says there has been no violence in and around those distribution points, the Israeli military has previously acknowledged firing warning shots.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. said that even though people in Gaza were being killed and injured while trying to access food, Israel was still declining more than half of its requests to access critical supplies of fuel and to coordinate humanitarian movement inside the enclave.",
      "\u201cIf the population is inadequately supplied with the essentials for their survival, Israel must agree to humanitarian relief and facilitate it by all the means at its disposal,\u201d Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, said at a news briefing.",
      "The U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, also renewed its criticism of GHF on Wednesday, saying in a post on X that the aid distribution model was \u201cputting lives at risk.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is also a distraction from the ongoing atrocities and a waste of resources,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a terrorist attack on southern Israel in which at least 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage, according to an Israeli tally. Israel vowed to eliminate Hamas in response, launching a military campaign in Gaza that has so far killed more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health ministry.",
      "The U.N. General Assembly is expected to vote Thursday on a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas, and the opening of all Israeli border crossings to allow for the delivery of aid. A similar resolution failed last week in the U.N. Security Council, where it was supported by 14 of the 15 members but vetoed by the United States because it was not tied to the release of the hostages.",
      "The U.N. vote comes a day after Israeli forces said they had recovered the bodies of two of the hostages inside Gaza, naming one of them as Yair Yaakov and not releasing the name of the other.",
      "Hamas still holds 53 hostages, less than half of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Tensions are also rising between Israel and Iran, where Israel is considering taking military action in the coming days, five people with knowledge of the situation told NBC News.",
      "Any strike would most likely be carried out without U.S. support as Trump is in advanced discussions with Tehran on a deal to curtail its nuclear program.",

      "Johnnie Moore, an evangelical Christian and former PR consultant who advised President Donald Trump during his first term, was appointed executive chairman of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) last week as the organization reeled from the resignation of his predecessor. It has also faced criticism from the United Nations and aid groups for a lack of independence from Israel, which backs the organization along with the U.S.",
      "Since it started operating late last month, the group has set up aid distribution sites in Gaza in response to international pressure over serious malnutrition in Gaza, where Israel recently lifted an 11-week complete blockade on food, aid and medical supplies entering the enclave.",
      "But regular bouts of deadly violence in and around those sites has also brought increasing scrutiny on the GHF\u2019s source of funding and the degree of autonomy it has from Israel.",
      "In an exclusive interview last week, Moore said it was \u201ca private foundation.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike lots of private foundations, you know, it doesn\u2019t disclose its donors,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything that we do and anything that we say publicly is going to distract from the mission, and we have one mission, just one mission, which is to feed Gazans.\u201d",

      "Other questions have also swirled around the GHF, even before it launched four aid distribution points in southern and central Gaza.",
      "A day before it began operations in the strip, Moore\u2019s predecessor Jake Wood resigned, saying in a letter published by Reuters that continuing to work with the group would compromise his \u201cneutrality, impartiality and independence.\u201d",
      "United Nations agencies and major aid groups that previously ran hundreds of community kitchens and bakeries in the enclave have also refused to cooperate with it, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid, forces widespread displacement in Gaza, and concentrates distribution in areas that may not be accessible to everyone.",
      "Setting up so few sites for food distribution meant crowd control problems were inevitable, according to Ciaran Donnelly, the senior vice president for international programs at the International Rescue Committee, which ran major relief operations in Gaza. \u201cNo aid organization would recommend doing it that way,\u201d he said.",
      "Inside Israel, as well, critics have questioned its independence. Last month in front of Israel\u2019s legislature, opposition leader Yair Lapid, without providing evidence, accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government of funding the GHF through foreign shell companies. And last week, citing unnamed public officials, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster, Kan, reported that the Israeli government had sent hundreds of millions of shekels to the group.",
      "Israel\u2019s government has repeatedly denied it funds the GHF.",
      "Any organization \u201cbeing used by occupying powers\u201d would not be able to carry out its task according to the humanitarian principles of impartiality and independence, said Philip Grant, the executive director of TRIAL International, a Geneva-based nongovernmental organization that advocates for victims of war crimes.",
      "TRIAL International has called on the Swiss government to investigate GHF, whose only registered presence outside the U.S. is in Geneva.",
      "While the GHF has said it is working to open new sites, including in northern Gaza, no such distribution points have opened yet, forcing some Palestinians with advanced injuries and disabilities to walk long distances for aid \u2014 often through dangerous areas and extreme heat.",
      "Such onerous requirements for something as basic as food could amount to war crimes, Grant said, and could even lead to accusations that organizations like GHF are complicit.",
      "\u201cThis operation comes with a huge risk in terms of violations of the Geneva Conventions,\u201d Grant said. \u201cEspecially the forced displacement of populations, which, if carried out, would be a participation in the war crime of enforced displacement of civilian population.\u201d"

      "Experts and humanitarian aid workers say Israel\u2019s blockade and 20-month military campaign have pushed Gaza to the brink of famine.",
      "At least 163 people have been killed and 1,495 wounded in a number of shootings near aid sites run by the Israeli and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which are in military zones that are off-limits to independent media. The Israeli military has acknowledged firing warning shots on previous occasions at people who it says approached its forces in a suspicious manner.",
      "The foundation says there has been no violence in or around the distribution points themselves. But it has warned people to stay on designated access routes and it paused delivery last week while it held talks with the military on improving safety.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that there is \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d on a possible ceasefire deal that would also return some of the 55 hostages still being held in Gaza, but said it was \u201ctoo early to hope.\u201d Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also mentioned Tuesday that there was progress in ceasefire negotiations.",

      "Witnesses told The Associated Press that Israeli forces opened fire around 2 a.m. (7 p.m. Monday ET), several hundred yards from the aid site in central Gaza. Crowds of Palestinians seeking desperately needed food often head to the sites hours before dawn, hoping to beat the crowds.",
      "The Israeli military said it fired warning shots at people it referred to as suspects. It said they had advanced toward its troops hundreds of yards from the aid site prior to its opening hours.",
      "Mohammed Abu Hussein, a resident of the nearby built-up Bureij refugee camp, said Israeli drones and tanks opened fire, and that he saw five people wounded by gunshots.",
      "Abed Haniyah, another witness, said Israeli forces opened fire \u201cindiscriminately\u201d as thousands of people were attempting to reach the food site.",

      "Additionally, three Palestinian medics were killed in an Israeli strike Tuesday in Gaza City, according to the health ministry.",
      "The medics from the health ministry\u2019s emergency service were responding to an Israeli attack on a house in Jaffa street in Gaza City when a second strike hit the building, the ministry said. The Israeli military did not comment on the strike, but said over the past day the air force has hit dozens of targets belonging to Hamas\u2019 military infrastructure, including rocket launchers.",
      "Israel and the United States say they set up the new food distribution system to prevent Hamas from stealing humanitarian aid and using it to finance militant activities.",
      "The United Nations, which runs a long-standing system capable of delivering aid to all parts of Gaza, says there is no evidence of any systematic diversion.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the new system, saying it violates humanitarian principles by allowing Israel to decide who receives aid and by forcing Palestinians to relocate to just three currently operational sites.",
      "The other two distribution sites are in the now mostly uninhabited southern city of Rafah, which Israel has transformed into a military zone. Israeli forces maintain an outer perimeter around all three hubs, and Palestinians must pass close to them to reach the distribution points.",
      "Hamas started the war with its terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 others hostage. They still hold 55 hostages, fewer than half of them alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry. It says women and children make up most of the dead, but doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants. Israel says it has killed more than 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population, often multiple times."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",

    "story": [
      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As the percussion of Israeli munitions rattled Tehran on Thursday night, President Donald Trump\u2019s MAGA movement observed a rare silence \u2014 a sign, influential Republicans say, of the divide within their own party when it comes to the prospect of a war between Israel and Iran.",
      "It took Trump, who comments publicly more often than any president in recent memory, about 10 hours to put out a statement on his Truth Social platform, in which he urged Iran to give up its nuclear weapons program.",
      "The first official U.S. assessment had been issued by the White House under Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s name, and it emphasized that America was \u201cnot involved\u201d in the strikes.",
      "In the meantime, Charlie Kirk, the co-founder of Turning Point USA, polled his 5 million X followers on the question of whether America should \u201cget involved in Israel\u2019s war against Iran.\u201d By Friday afternoon, the poll showed more than 350,000 votes, with an overwhelming proportion in the \u201cNo\u201d column.",
      "When Kirk read Rubio\u2019s statement on the strikes during a podcast Thursday night, Jack Posobiec, a right-wing activist popular with the MAGA audience, interjected that it was \u201cnot a supportive statement at all.\u201d Earlier Thursday, before the strikes, Posobiec had warned on X that a \u201cdirect strike on Iran right now would disastrously split the Trump coalition.\u201d",
      "And Steve Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast, which is influential with MAGA adherents within the administration and outside of it, steered clear of public commentary Thursday night.",
      "It all adds up to a demonstration of the quandary facing Trump as he and other elected Republicans seek safe political turf.",
      "Trump\u2019s electoral success owes in no small part to his isolationist-leaning \u201cAmerica First\u201d platform and his fierce criticism of drawn-out U.S. engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan that were launched by Republican President George W. Bush and continued by Democratic President Barack Obama.",
      "But Israel\u2019s latest action pits traditional Republican support for the Jewish state \u2014 and antipathy toward Iran \u2014 against the MAGA base\u2019s fear that the U.S. will be drawn into a new foreign war. And even within Trump\u2019s MAGA wing, there\u2019s a long-running split over  American backing of Israel. Trump has always been on the pro-Israel side of the divide.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are a pro-Israel party, and the president hasn\u2019t wavered on that,\u201d said one longtime Trump adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity within the MAGA movement. \u201cI think the challenge here is not how to move forward. The question is how to sell that to the recalcitrant base.\u201d",
      "If Trump is able to do that, it will be despite powerful voices on the other side of the debate weighing in. Tucker Carlson, one of Trump's most influential supporters, wrote in his newsletter Friday that the U.S. should \"drop Israel.\"",
      "\"If Israel wants to wage this war, it has every right to do so. It is a sovereign country, and it can do as it pleases,\u201d Carlson wrote, according to Jewish Insider. \u201cBut not with America\u2019s backing.\u201d",
      "Israel launched its attack to forestall Iran\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon and perhaps pressure Tehran into giving up that goal. Trump has been trying to construct a new version of an Obama-era nuclear deal that he shredded during his first term, and he articulated his hope Friday that Israel\u2019s campaign will help serve as a catalyst for Iran to sign a new pact. But it is not at all clear that the fighting won\u2019t have the opposite effect and spark a broader war between the two Middle Eastern powers.",
      "That\u2019s a showdown that establishment Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have been itching for.",
      "\u201cGame on,\u201d Graham \u2014 whose hawkish worldview predates the rise of the MAGA movement \u2014 wrote on X on Thursday night as video of explosions in Tehran bounced around the world.",
      "On the other side of the spectrum, Infowars host Owen Shroyer, one of the hundreds of people pardoned by Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, posted a video to X that framed the new conflict as an existential question for the president\u2019s base.",
      "\u201cAmerica, the Trump movement, MAGA \u2014 however you want to say it, there\u2019s going to be a lot of soul-searching as these events go on, because a lot of MAGA is anti-war,\u201d Shroyer said. \u201cWhat good is \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 if we can\u2019t even be isolated from this war-torn region of the world, if we can\u2019t even be isolated from these foreign countries and these foreign conflicts that are just filled with hate?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be able to make America great again,\u201d he added, \u201cas long as we\u2019re entangled in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "With Trump signaling approval for how Israel conducted strikes while cajoling Iran to make a deal Friday morning, some of the president\u2019s MAGA faithful seemed to settle on a narrative that U.S. involvement is acceptable to a point: troops on the ground.",
      "On a call with reporters Friday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asserted his own opposition to U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts while expressing confidence that Trump feels the same.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to support our ally, which we\u2019re doing, and we should do, unequivocally,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to provide them with arms for their own self-defense, which we have done and should do. But I can\u2019t imagine a world in which we would send United States troops, in which we would be involved in any kinetic activity, as the defense people like to say, there in the region, unless it\u2019s just defending our own installations.\u201d",
      "Israeli airstrikes on Iran are a far cry from American troops invading a nation that has been far more vulnerable to internal revolution than foreign conquest over the course of thousands of years of existence. Even the Republicans who are most aggressive when it comes to Iran talk about missiles and bombs rather than staging an incursion with American ground forces.",
      "But drawing a line on that is a middle ground that may satisfy most, if not all, Trump supporters for the moment.",
      "In the hours after the strikes, Trump allies hewed closely to the administration\u2019s sparse talking points.",

      "Israel\u2019s strikes, Cooke added, \u201cwere not just justified; they were inevitable. This matters to every American, including the MAGA movement. You can\u2019t negotiate with regimes chanting \u2018Death to America.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cooke also pointed to recent polling from Rasmussen, a right-leaning firm, that found that 57% of respondents favored U.S. military action to combat Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program. She said she believes MAGA loyalists will \u201cremain united\u201d behind Trump.",
      "\u201cMAGA wants peace, but we\u2019re not blind,\u201d Cooke added. \u201cYes, some in MAGA lean isolationist. But appeasement is not an option. Iran\u2019s leaders just threatened both Israel and the U.S., bringing us to a dangerous tipping point. Trump\u2019s 60-day deadline \u2014 blatantly ignored by Iran was followed by real consequences.\u201d",
      "Still, the political perils of taking sides in the early stages of what Israel says could be a sustained campaign were underscored by the reluctance of some MAGA figures to deal with the question head-on.",

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a close Trump ally, texted: \u201cMAGA is more concerned with the Battle for Los Angeles,\u201d where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines in a standoff with Americans protesting against immigration raids, \u201cthan the Battle for Tehran.\u201d",
      "What the White House appears to be most concerned about, at least in terms of Trump\u2019s domestic politics, is portraying the U.S. as uninvolved in the Middle East conflict.",
      "The word that trickled out overnight from the White House, and from a phone interview Trump gave to Fox News, emphasized that U.S. military had no role in the strikes.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Friday morning that Trump weighed in directly \u2014 and ominously.",
      "\u201cThere has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 British soccer legend David Beckham, a sporting icon and one of the world's most recognizable faces, has received a knighthood from King Charles III for services to sport and charity,  Buckingham Palace announced on Friday.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, seems inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he has not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and a near permanent fixture in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United, before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English men's national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of 92,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. This culminated in the club winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League, and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four different countries.",
      "An elegant player, Beckham's intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the LA Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, currently home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants, and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "Israel has become more serious about a unilateral strike on Iran as the negotiations between the United States and Iran appear closer to a preliminary or framework agreement that includes provisions about uranium enrichment that Israel views as unacceptable.",
      "Details about the Israeli discussions emerged before the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors formally found that Iran is not complying with its nuclear obligations for the first time in 20 years.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Dozens of mostly young men torched homes and smashed in windows in a Northern Irish town late Wednesday, in a third night of what officials described as coordinated \u201cracist thuggery\u201d against the community\u2019s ethnic minorities.",
      "Some residents of Ballymena, a town about 25 miles northwest of Belfast with a population of 30,000, responded to the anti-foreigner vigilantism by sticking the Union Jack or signs in their windows reading \u201cBritish household\u201d and \u201clocals live here\u201d in an apparent attempt to be spared by the rioters.",
      "NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News has seen residents from ethnic minorities packing up suitcases and leaving their homes, while others have spoken of their terror that the mob violence will continue.",
      "The violence first flared Monday during a vigil for a teenage girl who was the victim of an alleged sexual assault two days before. Two teenage boys, both 14, were charged with attempted rape and appeared in court Monday, communicating through a Romanian translator. The boys' identities have not been released because of their age.",
      "Masked rioters broke away from the otherwise peaceful vigil, building barricades and throwing bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at houses and police.",
      "Riot police responded with rubber bullets and a water cannon. More than 40 officers have been injured over the three nights, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, known as the PSNI, said.",
      "The violence also spread to other towns in Northern Ireland, such as Coleraine, where a bus station was attacked, access to the train station was blocked and rioters pushed trash cans onto the rails and set them alight Wednesday night, police said.",
      "In Larne, some people whose homes were destroyed were given shelter at a leisure center \u2014 until that was targeted and set on fire, too.",
      "In total, 10 people, all men in their teens, 20s and 30s, have been arrested. Three of them, aged 18, 17 and 15, have been charged and are set to appear in court Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis violence was clearly racially motivated and targeted at our minority ethnic community and police,\u201d Ryan Henderson, PSNI assistant chief constable, said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cIt was racist thuggery pure and simple and any attempt to justify and explain it as something else is misplaced.\u201d",
      "A Bulgarian national who lives in Ballymena and asked that her identity be protected told Sky News, \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying, honestly, I\u2019m scared to get out of the house,\u201d",
      "She said she had been in Northern Ireland \u201cfor a while \u2014 I\u2019ve pursued an education here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve done multiple things for the community and it\u2019s just absolutely heartbreaking that it\u2019s not the same Ballymena that I had when I first came here.\u201d",
      "\"It is important,\" said Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a think tank that focuses on immigration, identity and integration, \"to draw the clearest red line between the legitimate debate about immigration policy, including numbers, the pace of change and the quality of integration, and hateful abuse and threats.\"",
      "\u201cGovernments need to manage asylum much better nationally and locally,\u201d he said, \u201cbut must challenge more forcefully those stoking hatred and socializing violence against migrants, and the platforms that let hatred run riot without impediment.\u201d",
      "Northern Ireland is no stranger to unrest, but usually between \u201cunionists\u201d \u2014 mostly Protestants who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom \u2014 and \u201crepublicans\u201d \u2014 mostly Catholics who want it to become part of the Irish Republic.",
      "Though this conflict, called \u201cthe Troubles,\u201d officially ended with a peace deal in 1998, sporadic clashes still break out between these often segregated communities and police.",
      "This week\u2019s unrest in Ballymena follows a different trend, however. Anti-foreigner sentiment has in recent years surged across the U.K. and indeed Europe and the West.",
      "As prices for food, fuel and housing rise due to inflation, and public services become squeezed, some politicians mainly on the populist hard-right have sought to blame mass immigration for putting undue stress on the system.",
      "Pro-immigration progressives argue that immigrants provide an essential net benefit to society, both bringing high-level skills and filling less glamorous but necessary jobs.",
      "Last summer, anti-immigrant violence flared across the U.K. after three young girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in the town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "Online misinformation wrongly identified the British-born attacker as an immigrant."

      "A Pentagon official said the administration was reviewing AUKUS to ensure it was \u201caligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda\u201d on the eve of expected talks between President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "In an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said AUKUS was in the strategic interests of all three countries and that the new review of the deal signed in 2021 when Joe Biden was the U.S. president was not a surprise.",
      "\u201cI am very confident this is going to happen,\u201d he said of AUKUS, which would give Australia nuclear-powered submarines.",
      "\u201cThis is a multi-decade plan. There will be governments that come and go and I think whenever we see a new government, a review of this kind is going to be something which will be undertaken,\u201d Marles told the ABC.",
      "Albanese is expected to meet Trump for the first time next week on the sidelines of the Group of 7 meeting in Canada, where the security allies will discuss a request from Washington for Australia to increase defense spending from 2% to 3.5% of gross domestic product.",
      "Albanese has said defense spending would rise to 2.3% and has declined to commit to the U.S. target.",
      "The opposition Liberal party on Thursday pressed Albanese to increase defense spending.",
      "Under AUKUS, Australia was scheduled to make a $2 billion payment in 2025 to the U.S. to help boost its submarine shipyards and speed up lagging production rates of Virginia-class submarines to allow the sale of up to three U.S. submarines to Australia starting in 2032.",
      "The first $500 million payment was made when Marles met with his U.S. counterpart, Pete Hegseth, in February.",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s top policy adviser Elbridge Colby, who has previously expressed concern that the U.S. would lose submarines to Australia at a critical time for military deterrence against China, will be a key figure in the review, examining the production rate of Virginia-class submarines, Marles said.",
      "\u201cIt is important that those production and sustainment rates are improved,\u201d he added.",
      "AUKUS would grow the U.S. and Australian defense industries and generate thousands of manufacturing jobs, Marles said in a statement.",
      "John Lee, an Australian Indo-Pacific expert at Washington\u2019s conservative Hudson Institute think tank, said the Pentagon review was \u201cprimarily an audit of American capability\u201d and whether it can afford to sell up to five nuclear-powered submarines when it is not meeting its own production targets.",
      "\u201cRelatedly, the low Australian defense spending and ambiguity as to how it might contribute to a Taiwan contingency is also a factor,\u201d Lee said.",
      "John Hamre, president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former senior Pentagon official, told a Lowy Institute seminar in Sydney on Thursday there is a perception in Washington that \u201cthe Albanese government has been supportive of AUKUS but not really leaning in on AUKUS,\u201d and that defense spending is part of this.",
      "Under the multi-stage pact, four U.S.-commanded Virginia submarines will be hosted at a Western Australian navy base on the Indian Ocean starting in 2027, which a senior U.S. Navy commander told Congress in April gives the U.S. a \u201cstraight shot to the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "Albanese wants to buy three Virginia submarines starting in 2032 to bring its submarine force under Australian command.",
      "Britain and Australia will jointly build a new AUKUS-class submarine that is expected to come into service starting in 2040. Following a recent defense review, Britain said it would boost spending on its attack submarine fleet under AUKUS.",
      "Former Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who struck the AUKUS deal with Biden, said Thursday that Australia should \u201cmake the case again\u201d for the treaty.",
      "AUKUS would build more submarines across the three partners and was \u201cfundamentally about strengthening collective deterrence, particularly in the Indo-Pacific against potential adversaries,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn."

      "The announcement by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi comes as the U.S. is drawing down the presence of staffers who are not deemed essential to operations in the Middle East and their loved ones due to the potential for regional unrest.",
      "Meanwhile, there have been warnings that ships could be targeted in regional waters over the tensions.",
      "Al-Busaidi made the announcement on the social platform X.",
      "\u201cI am pleased to confirm the 6th round of Iran US talks will be held in Muscat this Sunday the 15th,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Iran had been saying for days that there would be talks, but Oman, which is serving as the mediator, had not confirmed them until now.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the U.S.",
      "Reaching a deal is one of several diplomatic priorities being juggled by U.S. President Donald Trump and his trusted friend and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. An accord could see the U.S. lift some of its crushing economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for it drastically limiting or ending its enrichment of uranium.",
      "But a failure to get a deal could see tensions further spike in a Middle East on edge over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Iran\u2019s economy, long ailing, could enter a free fall that could worsen the simmering unrest at home. Israel or the U.S. might carry out long-threatened airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. And Tehran may decide to fully end its cooperation with the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog and rush toward a bomb.",
      "Iran and the U.S. have held previous talks in Muscat and Rome."

      "Those living near the heavily fortified border have opposed the loudspeaker broadcasts, which they blame for severe noise nuisance.",
      "Seoul\u2019s resumption last July of a round-the-clock campaign of loudspeaker broadcasts was in response to Pyongyang\u2019s launch of balloons carrying trash over the border, the South\u2019s military said at the time.",

      "Views of the U.S. and confidence in its leader to handle world affairs have taken a dive in more than a dozen countries over the last year, according to a poll from the Pew Research Center released Wednesday and conducted over the first few months of President Donald Trump's second term.",
      "These declines are most pronounced among residents in neighboring Mexico and Canada, which have been at the center of high-profile spats with the administration, as well as a handful of NATO countries (like Sweden, Poland and the Netherlands) amid Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "Public sentiment about the U.S. has gone up in a few countries over the last year, most notably in Israel. But most of the two-dozen countries surveyed saw public opinion about the U.S. dip as Trump began his second term.",
      "Overall, the poll shows an international community full of increased skepticism of Trump and his \"America First\" foreign policies, from his administration's antagonistic relationship with traditional close allies to its focus on tariffs to its friendly posture toward right-wing, populist movements that have been amassing more power in Europe.",
      "Yet while the results in many countries are negative, Trump's marks are broadly higher this year in these nations than they were during the beginning of his first term eight years ago.",
      "Fifteen countries have seen significant drops in their opinion of America over the last year. In Mexico, 61% of respondents had a favorable opinion of the U.S. in 2024, but just 29% feel that way this year.",
      "In Sweden, which joined NATO in 2024 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine two years prior, a 47% favorable rating of the U.S. last year plummeted to just 19% this year, with 79% of Swedish respondents viewing America unfavorably.",
      "And in Canada, a 54% favorability mark in 2024 dropped 20 points in 2025, to 34%, amid Trump's repeated threats to make the country America's newest state.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, the share of people in Turkey, Nigeria and Israel who rated the U.S. favorably increased significantly over the last year.",
      "Pew polled 28,333 adults across 24 countries mostly over the phone or in person (Australia was the only country where people were polled online). The survey was in the field for various times across different countries from Jan. 8 to April 26. Polling in every country except Indonesia began after Trump\u2019s inauguration, but it was either concluded or close to done by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of sweeping international tariffs.",
      "When it comes to Trump specifically, a majority of respondents in five countries of the 24 surveyed said they have a lot or some confidence in the president to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs: Hungary, India, Israel, Nigeria and Kenya. Majorities in nine of the 10 European countries tested have either not too much or no confidence in Trump at all, with at least three-quarters of respondents saying so in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany and Sweden.",
      "Men, younger people and those who view their country's right-wing populist parties favorably are more likely to have more confidence in Trump.",
      "For example, 51% of Japanese people ages 18 to 34 have confidence in Trump, according to the poll, while 31% of Japanese people 50 years or older say the same.",
      "In the United Kingdom, 45% of men say they have confidence in Trump, compared with 28% of women.",
      "Respondents across 13 nations registered a double-digit decline in confidence in the U.S. president on world affairs from 2024 to 2025. While 63% in both Sweden and Germany had confidence in then-President Joe Biden last year, just 15% and 18%, respectively, said they have confidence in Trump.",
      "The survey also tested how well respondents felt several different personal characteristics described Trump. At least 60% of adults across 21 of the 24 countries surveyed said the word \"arrogant\" described Trump well.",
      "Majorities in 20 countries said he's \"a strong leader,\" while majorities in 21 countries called him \"dangerous.\"",
      "Majorities in three countries (Nigeria, India and Kenya) said Trump was \"honest,\" and majorities in five countries (Greece, Japan, Indonesia, Hungary and Kenya) called him \"diplomatic.\"",
      "Compared with his first term, the share of people across most of the surveyed countries who see Trump as a strong leader and qualified has increased. There has also been a dramatic increase in the share of adults who believe America's president is \"dangerous\" in countries where Pew also tested Biden\u2019s first year in office.",
      "On confidence in Trump to tackle global economic problems, Trump is underwater in every European country surveyed, though Hungarians are effectively split. The survey was mostly conducted before Trump announced global tariffs on April 2.",
      "In Mexico, where the survey was conducted following weeks of changing tariff policies on the country, 83% lack confidence in Trump\u2019s economic policies. In Canada, which has faced similar targeting from Trump, 74% lack confidence, and 57% said they have no confidence at all.",
      "Majorities in three countries \u2014 Kenya (56%) and Nigeria and Israel (62% each) \u2014 have confidence in Trump to handle \"the conflict between Israel and its neighbors.\" His numbers among the countries tested are the lowest in Turkey, where 7% are confident in his handling of the issue.",
      "Though a majority of Israelis expressed confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to handle the ongoing war, the poll found that confidence in Trump among right-wing Israelis is nearly four times higher, at 83%, compared with the 21% of left-wing Israelis who have confidence in Trump on the issue. Adults in most other countries said they were not confident in Trump's ability to handle the conflict.",
      "On Trump\u2019s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war, majorities in nearly all of the European countries surveyed, with the exception of Greece and Hungary, expressed little or no confidence in Trump. (Adults in Greece were split, and a narrow majority of Hungarians had at least some confidence in Trump to handle that conflict.) In France, Germany, Spain and Sweden, about three-quarters of adults said they had little or no confidence in Trump to handle the war."
