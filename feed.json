In modern times, that has evolved into a hierarchy of honorary distinctions awarded by the king on the recommendation of the government.",

      "Bardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals. Speaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said that no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month.",
      "Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman.\u201d Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.",
      "At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolize a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France\u2019s best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.",
      "Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \u201cMarianne,\u201d the national emblem of France and the official Gallic seal. Bardot\u2019s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.",
      "\u2018\u2019We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post.",
      "Bardot\u2019s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She traveled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.",
      "\u201cMan is an insatiable predator,\u201d Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007. \u201cI don\u2019t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\u201d",
      "Her activism earned her compatriots\u2019 respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest recognition.",
      "Later, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.",
      "She was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.",
      "Bardot\u2019s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d\u2019Ormale, a onetime adviser to far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described Le Pen, an outspoken nationalist with multiple racism convictions of his own, as a \u201clovely, intelligent man.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she supported the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \u201cexceptional woman\u201d who was \u201cincredibly French.\u201d",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass.\u201d",
      "Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born Sept. 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.",
      "Bardot once described her childhood as \u201cdifficult\u201d and said that her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.",
      "Vadim, a French movie produce who she married in 1952, saw her potential and wrote \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.",
      "The film, which portrayed Bardot as a teen who marries to escape an orphanage and then beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.",
      "The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\u201d Bardot said of her early films. \u201cI suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\u201d",

      "Bardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, and they divorced three years later.",
      "Among her films were \u201cA Parisian\u201d (1957); \u201cIn Case of Misfortune,\u201d in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960); \u201cPrivate Life\u201d (1962); \u201cA Ravishing Idiot\u201d (1964); \u201cShalako\u201d (1968); \u201cWomen\u201d (1969); \u201cThe Bear And The Doll\u201d (1970); \u201cRum Boulevard\u201d (1971); and \u201cDon Juan\u201d (1973).",
      "With the exception of 1963\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cContempt,\u201d directed by Godard, Bardot\u2019s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.",

      "She emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... my distress takes over,\u201d Bardot told the AP when asked about her racial hatred convictions and opposition to Muslim ritual slaughter,",

      "The 1960s French sex symbol, actor, singer and animal welfare activist Brigitte Bardot has died",
      "NEW YORK -- In addition to being a 1960s French sex symbol, actor, singer and animal welfare activist, Brigitte Bardot was a muse to many \u2014 in particular, musicians.",
      "Her name, with its alliterative cadence, became synonymous with a kind of classic beauty. In songs, Bardot is often not Bardot the woman, but a symbol for desire \u2014 shorthand for a bombshell. Decades removed from the peak of her screen fame, contemporary performers continue to sing her name despite her many controversies, including being convicted five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred and provocative comments about the #MeToo movement.",
      "It may not be her main legacy, but Bardot, who died Sunday in southern France, will live in on the songs that mention her. Across genre and language, here is a sampling.",
      "The last track of the canonical \u201cThe Freewheelin\u2019 Bob Dylan\u201d exhibits Dylan's wicked verbosity and elastic folk. \u201cWell, my telephone rang it would not stop / It\u2019s President Kennedy callin\u2019 me up / He said, My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow? I said my friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,\u201d he sings. \u201cAnita Ekberg / Sophia Loren / Country\u2019ll grow.\u201d",
      "The Brazilian artist Caetano Veloso composed the protest song at the beginning of the tropicalismo movement; it became a hallmark of his career and one of the best-known Brazilian songs of all time. In it, he sings, \u201cEm caras de presidentes / Em grandes beijos de amor / Em dentes, pernas, bandeiras / Bomba e Brigitte Bardot\u201d (\u201cIn faces of presidents / In big kisses of love / In teeth, legs, flags / Bombs and Brigitte Bardot\u201d).",
      "A central architect of French pop, singer Serge Gainsbourg wrote this duet for himself and Bardot. It's styled after a poem the outlaw Bonnie Parker wrote, titled \u201cThe Trail\u2019s End,\u201d shortly before she and partner Clyde Barrow were killed.",
      "Jaunty piano and Elton John's ascendent vocal melodies, all for a song with a less-than-optimistic title. John sings the words from his longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin: \u201cI\u2019d make an exception / If you want to save my life / Brigitte Bardot gotta come / And see me every night.\u201d",
      "The Pretenders know a little something about the social power of Bardot. The English rock band's principal songwriter and frontperson Chrissie Hynde sings: \u201cWhen love walks in the room / Everybody stand up / Oh, it\u2019s good, good, good / Like Brigitte Bardot.\u201d",

      "\u201cStratford-On-Guy,\u201d from influential indie rocker Liz Phair's seminal album \u201cExile in Guyville,\u201d takes aim at the dude-centric music scene.

      "In the second verse of \u201cWarlocks,\u201d from the funky California rockers Red Hot Chili Peppers, singer Anthony Kiedis near-scats, \u201cRing side and blow-by-blow / Another main event at the old Rainbow / We\u2019re comin\u2019 right on top of the tupelo / When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot.\u201d It's a descriptive image of Los Angeles \u2014 even with the inclusion of Bardot.",
      "Kali Uchis and Jorja Smith's dreamy collaboration imagines \u201cBardot\u201d as shorthand for a make-out session with a complicated partner. \u201cThe world\u2019s been asking us to lose control,\u201d Uchis swoons. \u201cAll we ever do is French like Brigitte Bardot (Brigitte Bardot).\u201d",
      "Olivia Rodrigo is best known for her spirited punk-pop, but she's also a power balladeer, lest anyone forget it was \u201cdrivers license\u201d that made her a household name. \u201cLacy,\u201d a cut from \u201cGuts,\u201d is soft and slow, with Rodrigo obsessing over a woman she is not.

      "Hollywood has wrapped up a turbulent 2025 with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and \u201cMarty Supreme.\"",
      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood wrapped up a turbulent year with big ticket sales for \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a box-office hit for Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet with \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d over a busy holiday weekend in movie theaters.",
      "As expected, James Cameron\u2019s latest trip to Pandora dominated ticket sales, collecting $88 million over the four-day Christmas-to-Sunday period and $64 million on the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though \u201cFire and Ash\u201d initially opened notably softer domestically than its 2022 predecessor, \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water,\u201d it held better in its second weekend. It dipped just 28%, whereas \u201cWay of Water\u201d fell 53%.",
      "In two weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has quickly amassed $217.7 million in North America for The Walt Disney Company. But the $400 million-budgeted film has been a massive draw internationally, grossing $542.7 million thus far overseas. To reach the box-office heights of the previous films, both of which rank among the biggest blockbusters ever, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will need to sustain business through New Year\u2019s and early January. If it does, \u201cAvatar\u201d could become the first franchise with three $2 billion movies.",
      "But much of the heat in theaters over Christmas and on the weekend belonged to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d A24\u2019s biggest budget release, Josh Safdie\u2019s 1950s-set table tennis drama collected $27.1 million over the four-day weekend, a smash success for the indie studio.",
      "Chalamet went to great lengths to promote the acclaimed release, including appearing atop the Sphere in Las Vegas. The strong opening proved that the 30-year-old star has drawing power beyond most of his contemporaries, and it marked a rare box-office win for a wholly original film. Safdie\u2019s film carries a price tag of about $70 million.",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d even bested the film most analysts expected to rank number two: Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cAnaconda.\u201d The big-screen comedy, starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, collected $23.7 million over the four-day holiday weekend. That\u2019s still good for comedy, a genre most studios have abandoned in recent years. But \u201cAnaconda\u201d (50% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) was surely dinged by poor reviews.",
      "Hollywood is ending the year with its best Christmas Day box office since before the COVID-19 pandemic, a celebratory final note in what\u2019s been a rough year for the film industry. Going into the year, expectations were high for the industry\u2019s first year this decade not marred by pandemic or strike.",
      "\u201cIt was a really solid end to a tumultuous year,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt's been a roller-coaster ride. I think the best news for the industry \u2014 I know we kind of say this every year \u2014 but if you look at the lineup for 2026, it's pretty incredible.\u201d",
      "But domestic ticket sales on the year are ending roughly on par with the disappointing $8.75 billion in 2024. With three days left in 2025, the box-office total is $8.76 billion, according to Comscore. By comparison, in 2019, that total was $11.4 billion.",
      "That\u2019s a worrying development for theaters, which are now nervously watching Netflix attempt to buy one of Hollywood\u2019s most storied studios in Warner Bros. The highest grossing film of the year was a Chinese production, the $2 billion-generating \u201cNe Zha 2.\u201d The most-watched movie of 2025 was \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d a movie Sony Pictures sold to Netflix. Even the Oscars are headed to YouTube.",
      "What worked in 2025? PG-rated movies. For the second year in a row, PG-rated movies outperformed PG-13 ones. Domestically, PG films generated $2.87 billion, according to Comscore, while PG-13 movies collected $2.78 billion.",
      "The three biggest Hollywood blockbusters were all PG-rated: \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($1.42 billion globally), \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion) and \"A Minecraft Movie\u201d ($958.2 million).",
      "\u201cZootopia 2\u201d even outranked the newcomers over the traditional weekend. In its fifth weekend, it earned another $20 million. Propelled by \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d Disney became the first studio since 2019 to cross $6 billion worldwide in the year.",
      "Yet expectations are already growing for a rebound year at the box office in 2026. Among the major titles upcoming are \u201cThe Super Mario Galaxy Movie,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man: Brand New Day,\u201d the live-action \u201cMoana,\u201d \u201cToy Story 5\u201d and \u201cThe Mandalorian and Grogu.\u201d",
      "The coming week, when schools are out and many people are off work, should be one of the busiest weeks of the year in theaters. Aside from the top films, a number of other releases will hope to capitalize.",

      "Christian music is growing in popularity while other genres struggle to grow new listenership",
      "NEW YORK -- It is one of the most surprising music stories of the year. While streams of new music \u2014 releases from the last 18 months \u2014 were down from last year, one genre is on the rise: Christian and gospel music, according to industry data and analytics company Luminate\u2019s 2025 Midyear Report.",
      "Jaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s vice president of music insights and industry relations, said the shift is led by acts like Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Elevation Worship, who are connecting with a \u201cyounger, streaming-forward fan base\u201d that's 60% female and 30% millennial. In fact, for the first time in 11 years, two contemporary Christian music songs \u2014 Frank\u2019s \u201cYour Way\u2019s Better\u201d and Lake\u2019s \u201cHard Fought Hallelujah\u201d with Jelly Roll \u2014 broke through the Billboard Hot 100's all-genre Top 40, placing them in direct competition with mainstream artists.",
      "It's also why traditionally secular artists like Jelly Roll, Killer Mike and T.I. are nominated in Christian music categories at the forthcoming 2026 Grammys \u2014 the lines are blurring.",
      "\u201cChristian music (is) unlike any other genre that\u2019s defined by a sonic component. Christian music is defined by its lyrical component,\u201d says Holly Zabka, the president of Provident Entertainment, a Sony Christian music subsidiary. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to a narrow definition. It\u2019s a lyrical component that can appeal to anyone\u2019s musical preference.\u201d",
      "From a label perspective, she\u2019s interested in pursuing artists that \u201cdon\u2019t have to fit within that narrow lane of Christian bookstore and Christian radio. It can be rap, hip-hop, it can be rock, it can be country, and that\u2019s appealing to a broader audience because it\u2019s what they\u2019re already listening to,\u201d she says. \u201cVery few people listen in a vacuum and only listen to one genre.\u201d",
      "But for many years, CCM jas held a reputation for being unimaginative \u2014 what writer John Jeremiah Sullivan infamously referred to as \u201cexcellence-proof\u201d \u2014 for its tendency to mimic and water down popular, contemporary mainstream sounds for a religious audience.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s been an improvement in quality,\u201d says Zabka. \u201cWhen all the music has to live side by side on these streaming platforms, we can\u2019t just be the cheap alternative. \u2018Oh, you like Taylor Swift? You will like this lesser version offering in the Christian genre.\u2019 We want to be the greatest art.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to imitate before you innovate,\u201d Chris Brown, singer and worship leader at Elevation Worship, jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s not as many rigid lines stylistically within Christian music as maybe there was 10 years ago or certainly like 20, 30 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was a period of time where people idealized Christian music as like, \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to have this look, we\u2019re going to sound like this,\u2019\u201d says two-time Grammy-winning Christian and pop musician Lauren Daigle. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more artistry now. People are very expressive. They\u2019re able to share their creativity. And that also comes with different types of people represented.\u201d",
      "Zabka says her genre is experiencing \u201ca special moment and \u2026 a perfect storm.\u201d Streaming and the ability to connect on social media have democratized music discovery, she says, allowing CCM to compete with secular music. That, partnered with what she views as \u201ca resurgence of faith\u201d in young people, is responsible for the interest.",
      "The number of Americans who identify as Christian has declined steadily for years, but that drop shows signs of slowing, according to a 2025 survey from the Pew Research Center. A new class of millennial and Gen Z Christian influencers, too, are aiming to connect with young people.",
      "\u201cChristian music has also shifted in its authenticity of the lyrics,\u201d Zabka adds, making the music more relatable than previous iterations of the genre, which often featured a neat message of \u201ceverything is going to be OK, just follow Jesus\u201d in 3 \u00bd minutes. Now, she says, \u201ctheir songs are much more authentic and real and honest. \u2018Life is hard. Breakups are hard. Bad things happen,\u2019 and that provides a level of hope that other music doesn\u2019t provide for the listener.\u201d",
      "Daigle points out that artists like Lake are performing in huge stadiums \u2014 categorical proof that Christian artists are growing in popularity.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people are looking at the world and \u2026 they find fortitude in this music, and they find a sense of strength in this music, and they find truth in this music,\u201d she says.",

      "The abbey is also the focus of an annual pilgrimage to the tomb of Edward the Confessor, which lies at the heart of the church. Edward, a monk-like monarch, was canonized as a saint in 1161.",
      "The monarch\u2019s annual holiday message is watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 56 independent nations, most of which have historic ties to Britain. The prerecorded speech is broadcast at 3 p.m., when many families are enjoying their traditional Christmas lunch.",
      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, is able to voice his own views and doesn\u2019t seek guidance from the government. It usually has a strong religious framework, reflects current issues and sometimes draws on the monarch\u2019s personal experiences.",

There is no cure for the condition, which for D\u00e1vila also makes the colors pink, violet, turquoise and yellow-green confusing.",
      "Since the mid-1980s, D\u00e1vila has painted in color through the help of glasses developed by an ophthalmologist in New York, where D\u00e1vila was living at the time. One lens is transparent and the other is shaded red, and they help him discriminate between contrasting shades that normally blur together. With the lenses, he can see almost two-thirds of the colors, but without them he only sees around 40% of the colors.",
      "D\u00e1vila compared his condition to having a box of chocolates but only being able to eat a sample of the selection. He says he has such a strong desire to see every color.",
      "\u201cIt's something that I miss in my life, that if somebody says, \u2018Look at this flower,\u2019 which is bright, bright pink, I want to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's something that comes from my heart so passionately. I can feel the vibration of color.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The attorneys for the man accused of killing rap icon Tupac Shakur in 1996 are pushing to suppress evidence obtained in what they claim was an \u201cunlawful nighttime search.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas criminal defense attorneys Robert Draskovich and William Brown filed a motion this week on behalf of their client, Duane \u201cKeffe D\u201d Davis, who was charged in the drive-by shooting of the iconic rapper off the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "Davis' attorneys argue a judge relied on a \u201cmisleading portrait\u201d of Davis as a dangerous drug dealer to grant the execution of a search warrant at night, which should only be done in exceptional circumstances, such as if there\u2019s a risk that evidence will disappear if officers wait until morning.",
      "In reality, Davis, an ex- gang leader from Southern California, had left the narcotics trade in 2008 and began doing inspection work for oil refineries, his attorneys say. He was a 60-year-old retired cancer survivor with adult children and grandchildren and had been living with his wife in Henderson, a city outside of Las Vegas, for nine years at the time the warrant was executed.",
      "\u201cThe court wasn\u2019t told any of this,\u201d his attorneys wrote in the motion. \u201cAs a result, the court authorized a nighttime search based on a portrait of Davis that bore little resemblance to reality \u2014 a clearly erroneous factual determination, in other words.\u201d",
      "The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 which conducted the search and collected Davis' electronic devices, \u201cpurported marijuana\u201d and tubs of photographs \u2014 declined to comment Friday, citing the pending litigation. At the time of the search, police said executing the warrant under the cover of darkness would allow officers to surround and secure the residence, and that if Davis barricaded himself, the darkness would allow officers to evacuate the surrounding homes with the least exposure to residents.",

      "His attorneys claim Davis\u2019 arrest stems from false public statements Davis had made in which he claimed to be present in the white Cadillac from which Shakur was shot. They say he has never offered details that would firmly corroborate his presence in the car, and that he benefited from saying he was present. He dodged drug charges by telling the story in a proffer agreement, and he has made money by repeating it in documentaries and his 2019 book, according to his attorneys.",

      "Ana Mar\u00eda Martinez and Danielle de Niese are the most notable sopranos in recent years to have sung live performances of the famous seductress, while Victoria de los \u00c1ngeles took it on late in her career in the 1970s, and Geraldine Farrar and Rosa Ponselle performed it decades earlier.",
      "Grigorian is to sing eight \u201cCarmen\u201d performances starting July 26 in a new production by Gabriela Carrizo with Jonathan Tetelman as Don Jos\u00e9, Kristina Mkhitaryan as Mica\u00ebla, with Teodor Currentzis conducting the Utopia Orchestra.",
      "\u201cI would not bet against her,\u201d Metropolitan Opera's general manager Peter Gelb said. \u201cShe\u2019s very much of a kind of old-school singer. She\u2019s kind of fearless when it comes to taking on new repertoire.\u201d",
      "Grigorian will be singing at Carnegie Hall on Saturday alongside Thomas Hampson, Sondra Radvanovsky, Nadine Sierra, Brian Jagde and Anita Monserrat, an unusually timed performance during a period when peripatetic singers often are home for the holidays.

      "The Trump administration has announced the initial disbursement from its $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program",
      "States will share $10 billion for rural health care next year in a program that aims to offset the Trump administration's massive budget cuts to rural hospitals, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "But while every state applied for money from the Rural Health Transformation Program, it won't be distributed equally. And critics worry that the funding might be pulled back if a state's policies don't match up with the administration's.",
      "Officials said the average award for 2026 is $200 million, and the fund puts a total of $50 billion into rural health programs over five years. States propose how to spend their awards, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns project officers to support each state, said agency administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.",
      "\u201cThis fund was crafted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed only six months ago now into law, in order to push states to be creative,\" Oz said in a call with reporters Monday.",
      "Under the program, half of the money is equally distributed to each state. The other half is allocated based on a formula developed by CMS that considered rural population size, the financial health of a state\u2019s medical facilities and health outcomes for a state\u2019s population.",
      "The formula also ties $12 billion of the five-year funding to whether states are implementing health policies prioritized by the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. Examples include requiring nutrition education for health care providers, having schools participate in the Presidential Fitness Test or banning the use of SNAP benefits for so-called junk foods, Oz said.",
      "Several Republican-led states \u2014 including Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas \u2014 have already adopted rules banning the purchase of foods like candy and soda with SNAP benefits.",
      "The money that the states get will be recalculated annually, Oz said, allowing the administration to \u201cclaw back\u201d funds if, for example, state leaders don't pass promised policies. Oz said the clawbacks are not punishments, but leverage governors can use to push policies by pointing to the potential loss of millions.",
      "\u201cI've already heard governors express that sentiment that this is not a threat, that this is actually an empowering element of the One Big Beautiful Bill,\" he said.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said she\u2019s heard from a number of Democratic-led states that refused to include such restrictions on SNAP benefits even though it could hurt their chance to get more money from the fund.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not where their state leadership is,\u201d she said.",

Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska who has been critical of many of the administration\u2019s policies but voted for the budget bill that slashed Medicaid, pointed to the fund when recently questioned about how the cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we added a $50 billion rural hospital fund, to help any hospital that\u2019s struggling,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cThis money is meant to keep hospitals afloat.\u201d",
      "But experts say it won't nearly offset the losses that struggling rural hospitals will face from the federal spending law's $1.2 trillion cut from the federal budget over the next decade, primarily from Medicaid. Millions of people are also expected to lose Medicaid benefits.",
      "Estimates suggest rural hospitals could lose around $137 billion over the next decade because of the budget measure. As many as 300 rural hospitals were at risk for closure because of the GOP\u2019s spending package, according to an analysis by The Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.",
      "\u201cWhen you put that up against the $50 billion for the Rural Health Transformation Fund, you know \u2014 that math does not add up,\u201d Cochran-McClain said.",
      "She also said there's no guarantee that the funding will go to rural hospitals in need. For example, she noted, one state\u2019s application included a proposal for healthier, locally sourced school lunch options in rural areas.",
      "And even though innovation is a goal of the program, Cochran-McClain said it's tough for rural hospitals to innovate when they were struggling to break even before Congress\u2019 Medicaid cuts.",
      "\u201cWe talk to rural providers every day that say, \u2018I would really love to do x, y, z, but I\u2019m concerned about, you know, meeting payroll at the end of the month,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSo when you\u2019re in that kind of crisis mode, it is, I would argue, almost impossible to do true innovation.\u201d",

      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say that keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Nina, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\u201d of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe science is increasingly clear.\u201d",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area\u2019s population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\u201cThe heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources, what the scientists call \u201climits of adaptation.\u201d The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",

Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\u201cThe geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \u201cAnd we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\u201d",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",

      "Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young ...",
      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone\u2019s gender expression doesn\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS\u2019s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",

      "Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.",
      "The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers \u2014 and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",
      "Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Trump returned to office \u2014 even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision upholding Tennessee\u2019s ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place.",

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "Popocat\u00e9petl\u2019s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it\u2019s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.",
      "Karina Rodr\u00edguez, a 26-year-old master\u2019s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.",
      "Having direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "\u201cWe have a natural laboratory here,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cvery important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.\u201d",

That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",

      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",

      "Zia was released from jail by Hasina\u2019s government in 2020 and was moved to a rented home, from where she regularly visited a private hospital. Her family repeatedly requested Hasina\u2019s administration to allow Zia to travel abroad for medical treatment, but was refused.",

      "Southern Hungary landowner Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti has been battling severe drought on his land",
      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3th, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention \u201cis simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.\u201d",
      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "China was ruled by the Kuomintang, or Nationalists, from 1927 to 1949. When civil war broke out, and Mao Zedong\u2019s communists overthrew the Nationalists, they fled to Taiwan, off the coast of southern China.",
      "There, they set up a government, and it evolved into a multiparty democracy that has ruled the island ever since. But the government in Beijing considers it sovereign territory and says it reserves the right to take over if it wishes. Talk of eventual reunification is frequent and fervent.",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's People's Liberation Army staged a second day of large-scale military drills around Taiwan on Tuesday, unleashing a live-fire show of force as part of what it called \u201cJustice Mission 2025\" to demonstrate its ability to deter any external support for the island it claims as part of its sovereign territory.",
      "Taiwanese officials said some of China's live rounds landed closer to the island than before.",
      "The maneuvers increased tension around the Taiwan Strait as 2025 drew to a close, but the impact extended beyond military pressure into everyday life. Taiwan\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration was notified that seven temporary \u201cdangerous zones\u201d had been set up around the strait. The schedules of Taiwan\u2019s four international airports on Tuesday afternoon showed over 150 international and domestic flights had revised times, delays or cancellations.",
      "Xinhua, China's official news agency, posted a commentary late Monday saying the drills sent an unequivocal message: That Beijing is always ready to prevent anything that tries to split Taiwan from China. Each escalation, it said, would be met with stronger countermeasures.",
      "\u201cBy currying favor with the United States through obsequious loyalty gestures and promoting arms purchases, the DPP is binding the entire island of Taiwan to its catastrophic secessionist chariot, disregarding public opinion,\u201d it wrote, referring to Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party.",
      "The PLA\u2019s Eastern Theater Command sent destroyers, frigates, fighters and bombers to the waters to the north and south of the island to test its ability in sea-air coordination and blockading. Its ground forces carried out long-range, live-fire drills in the waters to the island\u2019s north. They also organized live-fire training alongside simulated long-range joint strike with air, navy and missiles units, in the waters to Taiwan\u2019s south, achieving what command spokesperson Li Xi called \u201cdesired effects.\u201d",
      "Hsieh Jih-sheng, deputy chief of the general staff for intelligence at the Taiwanese Defense Ministry, said some of the 27 rockets detected in the waters near Taiwan fell within its 24-nautical-mile (44-kilometer) line. \u201cThe landing points of rounds definitely were closer to Taiwan compared to the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a message it deliberately wants to convey.\u201d",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said Tuesday his territory would act responsibly by neither escalating conflict nor provoking disputes. He condemned the drills.",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry said it had detected 130 aircraft, including fighters and bombers, 14 military ships and eight other official ships around the island between 6 a.m. Monday and 6 a.m. Tuesday. Its forces kept monitoring and deployed aircraft, navy ships and coastal missile systems in response. Ninety of the Chinese aircraft crossed the median line of the strait. A Chinese military balloon was also spotted, it said.",
      "The ministry later said it detected 71 aircraft, 13 military ships and 15 coastal guard and official vessels as of 3 p.m. Tuesday, in addition to four other warships in the western Pacific. A total of 941 flights were affected by the drills, it said.",
      "\u201cThe military power is not necessarily the strongest, but the scale of the drills has become larger each time compared to the last,\u201d Hsieh said. He accused Chinese forces of trying to influence public morale and undermine trust in the Taiwanese military and government.",
      "China has vowed to seize the island, by force if necessary. Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis.",
      "Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said the drills served as a stern warning to \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatist forces and external forces, without naming any countries.",

      "It was the first time a president had commuted to Cheong Wa Dae since May 9, 2022, the final day of former President Moon Jae-in\u2019s term, before Yoon began his presidency working out of a converted Defense Ministry building. Following the relocation, Yoon opened parts of Cheong Wa Dae to the public as a tourist site, which drew millions of visitors.",
      "Lee, who won a snap presidential election in June following Yoon\u2019s removal over a brief declaration of martial law in December 2024, spent weeks relocating the presidential office back to Cheong Wa Dae, also known as the Blue House, as he seeks to erase the legacy of his now-jailed predecessor.",

      "Martial law lasted only hours, after a quorum of lawmakers broke through a military blockade and voted to lift the measure. Yoon was impeached later that month, removed from office in April by a Constitutional Court ruling and re-arrested in July. He now faces serious criminal charges, including rebellion, which carries a possible life sentence or the death penalty.",

      "Russia\u2019s nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile system has entered active service, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense says, as negotiators continue to search for a breakthrough in peace talks to end Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine",
      "Russia\u2019s nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile system has entered active service in Belarus, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, as the U.S. efforts to broker a deal to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine have entered a pivotal stage.",
      "The ministry released a video showing combat vehicles that are part of the mobile intermediate range ballistic missile system driving across a forest as part of combat training. The ministry\u2019s announcement followed a statement from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who said earlier this month that the Oreshnik had arrived in the country. Lukashenko said that up to 10 such missile systems will be stationed in Belarus.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that the Oreshnik would enter combat duty before the year's end. He made the statement at a meeting with top Russian military officers, where he warned that Moscow will seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin\u2019s demands in peace talks.",
      "The announcement comes at a critical time for Russia-Ukraine peace talks. U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Florida resort Sunday and insisted that Kyiv and Moscow were \u201ccloser than ever before\u201d to a peace settlement.",
      "However, Moscow and Kyiv remain deeply divided on key issues, including whose forces withdraw from where in Ukraine and the fate of Ukraine\u2019s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong U.S.-led negotiations could still collapse.",
      "Putin has sought to portray himself as negotiating from a position of strength as Ukrainian forces strain to keep back the bigger Russian army.",
      "Russia first tested a conventionally armed version of the Oreshnik \u2014 Russian for hazelnut tree \u2014 to strike a Ukrainian factory in November 2024. Putin has bragged that Oreshnik\u2019s multiple warheads plunge at speeds of up to Mach 10 and can\u2019t be intercepted, and that several of them used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack.",
      "The Russian leader has warned the West that Russia could use the Oreshnik next against allies of Kyiv that allowed it to strike inside Russia with their longer-range missiles.",
      "The Belarusian Defense Ministry said Tuesday that the Oreshnik has a range of up to 5,000 kilometers (3,100 miles).",
      "Russian state media boasted that it would take the missile only 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO headquarters in Brussels. There\u2019s no way to know whether it\u2019s carrying a nuclear or a conventional warhead before it hits the target.",
      "Intermediate-range missiles can fly between 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,400 miles). Such weapons were banned under a Soviet-era treaty that Washington and Moscow abandoned in 2019.",

      "Russia previously has deployed tactical nuclear weapons to the territory of its Belarus, whose territory it used to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Lukashenko has said that his country has several dozen Russian tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "While signing a security pact with Lukashenko in December 2024, Putin said that even with Russia controlling the Oreshniks, Moscow would allow Minsk to select the targets. He noted that if the missiles are used against targets closer to Belarus, they could carry a significantly heavier payload.",
      "In 2024, the Kremlin released a revised nuclear doctrine, noting that any nation\u2019s conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country. The threat was clearly aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal.",
      "The revised Russian doctrine also placed Belarus under the Russian nuclear umbrella.",
      "Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades. His government has been repeatedly sanctioned by the West for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory for the invasion of Ukraine. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya has said that the deployment of Oreshnik to Belarus deepens the country\u2019s military and political dependence on Russia.",

      "The Emirati Foreign Ministry hours later denied it shipped weapons but acknowledged it sent the vehicles \u201cfor use by the UAE forces operating in Yemen.\u201d It also claimed Saudi Arabia knew about the shipment ahead of time.

They issued a 72-hour ban on border crossings in territory they hold, as well as entries to airports and seaports, except those allowed by Saudi Arabia. It remained unclear whether that coalition, governed under the umbrella of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, would remain intact.",

      "South Korea is chasing a coal-free future in efforts to slash carbon emissions, an ambitious goal for the fossil fuel-dependent country",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is promising to shrink its reliance on coal power as part of its pledge to reduce carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but that ambition is at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s push for more U.S. natural gas exports.",
      "At recent United Nations climate talks, South Korea's new Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced plans to retire most of the country\u2019s coal-fired power plants by 2040 and to at least halve its carbon emissions by 2035.",
      "Experts say this shows that South Korea, a major coal importer with one of the world\u2019s largest fleets of coal plants, wants to speed up its renewable energy transition, which lags behind its neighbors and global averages.",
      "But as part of trade deals with President Donald Trump, Seoul is raising imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Climate activists contend such plans may conflict with the country\u2019s pledges to help curb climate change and could lock South Korea into a fossil fuel-dependent future.",
      "Talks are underway for South Korea to invest $350 billion in U.S. projects and purchase up to $100 billion worth of U.S. energy products, including LNG, a natural gas cooled to liquid form for easy storage and travel. It burns cleaner than coal, but still causes planet-warming emissions, especially of methane.",
      "South Korea\u2019s overall LNG imports may not increase if it offsets purchases of more U.S. natural gas by reducing imports from other sources such as Australia and the Middle East.",
      "Still, it's unclear how South Korea will \u201cmanage and consolidate all this somehow contradictory planning regarding its energy sector,\" said Michelle Kim, an energy specialist for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae Myung, who won a snap election in June, campaigned for stronger climate commitments. They had softened under his conservative predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after a short-lived martial law declaration.",
      "\u201cAs the global temperature rises, we all need to responsibly take climate action and Korea will have a stronger sense of responsibility in tackling the climate crisis,\" Kim Sung-hwan, the inaugural Minister of Climate, Energy and Environment, said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "South Korea's goal to cut carbon emissions by 53% to 61% of its 2018 level, fell short of climate activists\u2019 expectations. Business lobbies representing major manufacturers had proposed a 48% emissions reduction target.",
      "\u201cThis range presents an effort by the government to accommodate two very different ways of thinking about the economic and climate future of the nation,\u201d said Joojin Kim of the Seoul-based advocacy group, Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "The South Korean government made the ambitious commitment to increase its clean energy use even after Trump's sweeping \u2018America First\u2019 tariffs spurred energy negotiations between Seoul and Washington.",
      "As part of its broader efforts to avoid higher tariffs, South Korea offered to import more LNG from the U.S., but the final trade deal has not been announced.",
      "The agreement still under negotiation could last between three to 10 years, according to industry analysis and U.S. federal documents. Depending on the deal's duration, South Korea may import between 3 million to 9 million tons of American LNG a year.",
      "LNG made up almost a fifth of South Korea\u2019s total energy supply last year, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. The government's target was to cut that to 10.6% by 2038.",
      "South Korea risks its climate goals if the pending trade deal increases the total volume of imported LNG, which will likely lead to an oversupply issue and the excess burning of gas to justify the deal, said Insung Lee, with Greenpeace in Seoul.",

      "Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffett this week",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffettthis week.",
      "Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.",
      "Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.",
      "Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.",
      "Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.",
      "The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company\u2019s culture.",
      "Part of Buffett\u2019s sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.",
      "\u201cI think the investment community would likely applaud Greg\u2019s management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,\" Seifert said. \"And if it helps performance, that can\u2019t really be faulted.\u201d",

      "Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.",
      "Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.",
      "Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "But if Abel can\u2019t find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.",
      "Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.",
      "Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses \u201ccan almost take care of themselves.\" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.",
      "One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.",
      "\u201cAs a long-term shareholder, we aren\u2019t too concerned with Todd\u2019s departure and don\u2019t think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,\" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. \"Todd\u2019s situation is unique. It\u2019s just a reminder that Warren\u2019s pending departure is imminent and they\u2019re preparing for a new phase \u2014 one that we\u2019re still excited to see unfold.\u201d",

The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is by far the strongest contender.",

      "Critics of the current system say that the election is designed to add a facade of legitimacy to the status quo. Military rule began when soldiers ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. It blocked her National League for Democracy party from serving a second term despite winning a landslide victory in the 2020 election.",

      "However, the election may provide an excuse for neighbors like China, India and Thailand to say that the vote represents progress toward stability.

      "Dominion Energy Virginia said in its lawsuit filed late Tuesday that the government's order is \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and unconstitutional. The Richmond-based company is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a project it says is essential to meet dramatically growing energy needs driven by dozens of new data centers.",

      "The other projects are the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Connecticut and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind.

    "published": "Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:24:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The month after Christmas has been dubbed &ldquo;Returnuary&rdquo; for good reason",
    "story": [
      "The month after Christmas has been dubbed \u201cReturnuary\u201d for good reason",
      "The holiday season will soon come to a close, but the busiest time of the year for product returns is just beginning.",
      "The National Retail Federation estimates 17% of holiday purchases will be sent back this year. More retailers are reporting extended return windows and increased holiday staff to handle the rush this year.",
      "A major driver for returns is uncertainty. When we buy for other people, finding what they want is a bit of a guessing game. Online purchases have higher return rates because finding the right size and color is tough when you're just staring at images on screens.",
      "\u201cClothing and footwear, as you can imagine, because fit is such an important criteria, they have higher rates of returns,\u201d said Saskia van Gendt, chief sustainability officer at Blue Yonder, which sells software designed to improve companies' supply chain management.",
      "Returns come with an environmental cost, but there's a lot consumers and companies are doing to minimize it.",
      "If a company sells a thing, it's probably packaged in plastic. Plastic is made from oil, and oil production releases emissions that warm the planet. If that thing is bought online, it's put on a plane or a train or a truck that usually uses oil-based fuel.",
      "If you buy a thing and return it, it goes through most or all of that all over again.",
      "And once those products are back with the retailer, they may be sent along to a refurbisher, liquidator, recycler or landfill. All these steps require more travel, packaging and energy, ultimately translating to more emissions. Joseph Sarkis, who teaches supply chain management at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, estimates that returning an item increases its impact on the planet by 25% to 30%.",
      "Roughly a third of the time, those returns don't make their way to another consumer. Because frequently, it's not worth reselling.",
      "If, for example, you get a phone, but you send it back because you don't like the color, the seller has to pay for the fuel and equipment to get the phone back, and then has to pay for the labor to assess whether it has been damaged since leaving the facility.",
      "\u201cIt can be quite expensive,\u201d said Sarkis. \u201cAnd if you send it out to a new customer and the phone is bad, imagine the reputational hit you\u2019ll get. You\u2019ll get another return and you\u2019ll lose a customer who\u2019s unhappy with the product or material. So the companies are hesitant to take that chance.\u201d",
      "Something as expensive as a phone might get sold to a secondary or refurbishment market. But that $6 silicone spatula you got off Amazon? Probably not worth it. Plus, some stuff \u2014 think a bathing suit or a bra \u2014 is less attractive to customers if there's a chance it's been resold. The companies know that.",
      "And that's where the costs of returns are more than just environmental \u2014 and consumers wind up paying. Even free returns aren't really free.",
      "\u201cRefurbishment, inspection, repackaging, all of these things get factored into the retail price,\u201d said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "If you want to reduce the impact of your returns, the first move is to increase their chances of resale. Be careful not to damage it, and reuse the packaging to send it back, said Cardiff University logistics and operations management lecturer Danni Zhang.",
      "If you have to return something, do it quickly. That ugly Christmas sweater you got at the white elephant office party has a much better chance of selling on Dec. 20 than it does on Jan. 5. Zhang said it's not worth the cost to the company to store that sweater once it's gone out of season.",

      "Another tip: in-person shopping is better than online because purchases get returned less often, and in-person returns are better, too \u2014 because those items get resold more often. Zhang said it reduces landfill waste. Sarkis said it reduces emissions because companies with brick-and-mortar locations spread out across the country and closer to consumers thus move restocked goods shorter distances.",
      "\u201cIf I can return in-store, then I definitely will,\" Zhang said. \u201cThe managers can put that stuff back to the market as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Obviously the best thing consumers can do is minimize returns. Many shoppers engage in \u201cbracketing behavior,\u201d or buying multiple sizes of the same item, keeping what fits, and returning the rest.",
      "\u201cThis behavior of bringing the dressing room to our homes is not sustainable,\u201d said Faires.",
      "If you're buying for someone else, you can also consider taking the guesswork out of the equation and going for a gift card.",
      "\u201cI know we do really want to pick up something really nice to express our love for our friends or our family. But if we are more sustainable, probably the gift card will be much better than just purchasing the product,\u201d Zhang said.",
      "Sarkis wants to see companies provide more information in product descriptions about the environmental impact of returning an item, or how much of the purchase price factors in return costs.",
      "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if they want to send a negative message,\" he said. \u201cIf you're telling someone to stop something because of negative results, that's not going to sell.\u201d",
      "Sarkis and Zhang both say charging for returns would help. Already Amazon is requiring customers pay in certain situations.",
      "On the tech side, Blue Yonder\u2019s recent acquisition of Optoro, a company that provides a return management system for retailers and brands, uses a software to quickly assess the condition of returned products and route them to stores that are most likely to resell them.",
      "\u201cHaving that process be more digitized, you can quickly assess the condition and put it back into inventory,\u201d said van Gendt. \u201cSo that\u2019s a big way to just avoid landfill and also all of the carbon emissions that are associated with that.\u201d",
      "Clothing is returned most often. Many sizes do not reflect specific measurements, like women's dresses, so they vary a lot between brands. Zhang said better sizing could help reduce the need for returns. On top of that, Sarkis said more 3D imaging and virtual reality programs could help customers be more accurate with their purchases, saving some returns.",

      "Indiana football is rewriting its reputation and giving Bloomington something to be excited about",
      "Bill Murphy has been an Indiana football season ticket holder for 66 years. He says he has rarely missed a game even though 55 of them have been losing seasons in a historic stretch of bowl-less holidays.",
      "One of those rare misses stands out: The 1968 Rose Bowl, when Indiana lost 14-3 to O.J. Simpson and a USC team that went on to be crowned national champion. Murphy was 15 at the time, and his parents weren't on board with sending him to California alone. But neither Murphy nor his parents could have anticipated the bowl drought that followed. The Hoosiers didn't make another bowl until 1979, and after that, 1986.",
      "Now 77, Murphy wasn't sure this day would come again. So a backup plan was established in case of an emergency.",
      "\u201cI told my wife, son and daughter, I told them, \u2018If I die before we go to the Rose Bowl again, I want you to take my urn and buy a program, buy a seat, set the program and urn on the seat, and I\u2019ll be there with you guys,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Murphy's story would resonate with any lifelong Indiana football fan, though he warns there may not be many. He grew up a dedicated supporter of Indiana's losing football team in Bloomington, a city that rallied around the powerhouse and championship-winning basketball team.",
      "The script has since flipped a bit. Hoosiers fans have had more to cheer about the past season or two when it comes to football than basketball. A team that was once an afterthought in its community has a new brand of committed fans who have the chance to head to Pasadena for the program's biggest game in years: Top-seeded Indiana will play Alabama on Thursday in the Grandaddy of Them All for a chance to advance to the College Football Playoff semifinals.",
      "The program has reached new heights over the past two years under back-to-back AP Coach of the Year Curt Cignetti, finally abandoning the title of losingest program in the history of the Bowl Subdivision and handing the unwelcome crown to Northwestern earlier this year. Indiana finished the regular season as Big Ten champion with a perfect 13-0 record behind quarterback Fernando Mendoza, the school's first Heisman Trophy winner.",
      "Longtime fan Kevin Harrell wouldn\u2019t miss the Rose Bowl, even though his last trip to the stadium wasn't too long ago. When the Big Ten expanded with four West Coast teams in 2024, he took the opportunity to see his team play in the iconic stadium, thinking the mid-September matchup against UCLA could be the closest he\u2019d come to seeing Indiana in the Rose Bowl this century.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s beyond my wildest dreams,\u201d Harrell said, admitting that having this level of confidence in the team is an unfamiliar feeling. \u201cWe have always expected the worst. We could always find a new way to lose the game. It\u2019s been kind of weird how quickly I\u2019ve gone from that way of thinking to expecting to win. I expect this team to win every time they take the field, and I think that\u2019s just a testament to the job Curt Cignetti has done.\u201d",
      "Not all fans have earned their stripes like Harrell and Murphy. The Indiana football bandwagon is filling up.",
      "Memorial Stadium reached the brim with new followers this season. \u201cHeis-Mendoza\u201d chants on Saturdays become common this fall, and for the second straight year, all four home conference games sold out.",

      "So now, 58 years later, Murphy finally gets the chance to make up for the missed game that has haunted him for decades.",
      "\u201cFortunately for me, I get to go this year and actually sit in a seat and see the game,\" Murphy said. \u201cI'm still pinching myself, trying to make sure I'm not dreaming.\u201d",

      "Southern Hungary landowner Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti has been battling severe drought on his land",
      "KISKUNMAJSA, Hungary -- Oszk\u00e1r Nagyap\u00e1ti climbed to the bottom of a sandy pit on his land on the Great Hungarian Plain and dug into the soil with his hand, looking for a sign of groundwater that in recent years has been in accelerating retreat.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much worse, and it\u2019s getting worse year after year,\u201d he said as cloudy liquid slowly seeped into the hole. \u201dWhere did so much water go? It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Nagyap\u00e1ti has watched with distress as the region in southern Hungary, once an important site for agriculture, has become increasingly parched and dry. Where a variety of crops and grasses once filled the fields, today there are wide cracks in the soil and growing sand dunes more reminiscent of the Sahara Desert than Central Europe.",
      "The region, known as the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g, has been described by some studies as semiarid \u2014 a distinction more common in parts of Africa, the American Southwest or Australian Outback \u2014 and is characterized by very little rain, dried-out wells and a water table plunging ever deeper underground.",
      "In a 2017 paper in European Countryside, a scientific journal, researchers cited \u201cthe combined effect of climatic changes, improper land use and inappropriate environmental management\u201d as causes for the Homokh\u00e1ts\u00e1g's aridification, a phenomenon the paper called unique in this part of the continent.",
      "Fields that in previous centuries would be regularly flooded by the Danube and Tisza Rivers have, through a combination of climate change-related droughts and poor water retention practices, become nearly unsuitable for crops and wildlife.",
      "Now a group of farmers and other volunteers, led by Nagyap\u00e1ti, are trying to save the region and their lands from total desiccation using a resource for which Hungary is famous: thermal water.",
      "\u201cI was thinking about what could be done, how could we bring the water back or somehow create water in the landscape,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti told The Associated Press. \"There was a point when I felt that enough is enough. We really have to put an end to this. And that's where we started our project to flood some areas to keep the water in the plain.\u201d",
      "Along with the group of volunteer \u201cwater guardians,\u201d Nagyap\u00e1ti began negotiating with authorities and a local thermal spa last year, hoping to redirect the spa's overflow water \u2014 which would usually pour unused into a canal \u2014 onto their lands. The thermal water is drawn from very deep underground.",
      "According to the water guardians' plan, the water, cooled and purified, would be used to flood a 2\u00bd-hectare (6-acre) low-lying field \u2014 a way of mimicking the natural cycle of flooding that channelizing the rivers had ended.",
      "\u201cWhen the flooding is complete and the water recedes, there will be 2\u00bd hectares of water surface in this area,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"This will be quite a shocking sight in our dry region.\u201d",
      "A 2024 study by Hungary\u2019s E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University showed that unusually dry layers of surface-level air in the region had prevented any arriving storm fronts from producing precipitation. Instead, the fronts would pass through without rain, and result in high winds that dried out the topsoil even further.",
      "The water guardians hoped that by artificially flooding certain areas, they wouldn't only raise the groundwater level but also create a microclimate through surface evaporation that could increase humidity, reduce temperatures and dust and have a positive impact on nearby vegetation.",

      "Tam\u00e1s T\u00f3th, a meteorologist in Hungary, said that because of the potential impact such wetlands can have on the surrounding climate, water retention \u201cis simply the key issue in the coming years and for generations to come, because climate change does not seem to stop.\u201d",
      "\"The atmosphere continues to warm up, and with it the distribution of precipitation, both seasonal and annual, has become very hectic, and is expected to become even more hectic in the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Following another hot, dry summer this year, the water guardians blocked a series of sluices along a canal, and the repurposed water from the spa began slowly gathering in the low-lying field.",
      "After a couple of months, the field had nearly been filled. Standing beside the area in early December, Nagyap\u00e1ti said that the shallow marsh that had formed \"may seem very small to look at it, but it brings us immense happiness here in the desert.\u201d",
      "He said the added water will have a \u201chuge impact\u201d within a roughly 4-kilometer (2\u00bd-mile) radius, \"not only on the vegetation, but also on the water balance of the soil. We hope that the groundwater level will also rise.\u201d",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes because of high heat and low rainfall. Weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall gross domestic product, prompting Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce this year the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "After the water guardians' first attempt to mitigate the growing problem in their area, they said they experienced noticeable improvements in the groundwater level, as well as an increase of flora and fauna near the flood site.",
      "The group, which has grown to more than 30 volunteers, would like to expand the project to include another flooded field, and hopes their efforts could inspire similar action by others to conserve the most precious resource.",
      "\u201cThis initiative can serve as an example for everyone, we need more and more efforts like this,\" Nagyap\u00e1ti said. \"We retained water from the spa, but retaining any kind of water, whether in a village or a town, is a tremendous opportunity for water replenishment.\u201d",

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "After hours of walking up the volcano\u2019s flank, Cal\u00f2\u2019s team sets up camp in a pine grove at about 12,500 feet of elevation, an apparent safe spot from pyroclastic explosions, since the trees have managed to grow to significant height.",
      "A short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.",
      "They must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path. Now, the dry clearing provides a spectacular view: to the east the Pico de Orizaba \u2014 Mexico\u2019s tallest volcano and mountain \u2014 and the inactive volcano La Malinche; to the north, Iztacc\u00edhuatl, a dormant volcanic peak known as \u201cthe sleeping woman.\u201d",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl\u2019s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it\u2019s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.",
      "Karina Rodr\u00edguez, a 26-year-old master\u2019s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.",
      "Having direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "\u201cWe have a natural laboratory here,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cvery important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.\u201d",
      "At 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.",
      "Ash, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.",
      "At a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it\u2019s still working. They download its data and rebury it.",
      "A \u201cvolcanic bomb,\u201d a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",
      "Digging up one of the last seismic stations, Cal\u00f2\u2019s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines\u2019 wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.",
      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, the master's student, said.",

      "Many retirement developments serve as a tranquil refuge for older people who can no longer traveling to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures",
      "LOS GATOS, Calif. -- Like many retirement communities, The Terraces serves as a tranquil refuge for a nucleus of older people who no longer can travel to faraway places or engaging in bold adventures.",
      "But they can still be thrust back to their days of wanderlust and thrill-seeking whenever caretakers at the community in Los Gatos, California, schedule a date for residents \u2014 many of whom are in their 80s and 90s \u2014 to take turns donning virtual reality headsets.",
      "Within a matter of minutes, the headsets can transport them to Europe, immerse them in the ocean depths or soar them on breathtaking hang-gliding expeditions while they sit by each other. The selection of VR programming was curated by Rendever, a company that has turned a sometimes isolating form of technology into a catalyst for better cognition and social connections in 800 retirement communities in the United States and Canada.",
      "A group of The Terraces residents who participated in a VR session earlier this year found themselves paddling their arms alongside their chairs as they swam with a pod of dolphins while watching one of Rendever's 3D programs. \u201cWe got to go underwater and didn't even have to hold our breath!\u201d exclaimed 81-year-old Ginny Baird following the virtual submersion.",
      "During a session featuring a virtual ride in a hot-air balloon, one resident gasped, \u201cOh my God!\u201d Another shuddered, \u201cIt's hard to watch!\u201d",
      "The Rendever technology can also be used to virtually take older adults back to the places where they grew up as children. For some, it will be the first time they've seen their hometowns in decades.",
      "A virtual trip to her childhood neighborhood in New York City's Queens borough helped sell Sue Livingstone, 84, on the merits of the VR technology even though she still is able to get out more often than many residents of The Terraces, which is located in Silicon Valley about 55 miles south of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt isn't just about being able to see it again, it's about all the memories that it brings back,\u201d Livingstone said. \u201cThere are a few people living here who never really leave their comfort zones. But if you could entice them to come down to try out a headset, they might find that they really enjoy it.\u201d",
      "Adrian Marshall, The Terraces' community life director, said that once word about a VR experience spreads from one resident to another, more of the uninitiated typically become curious enough to try it out \u2014 even if it means missing out on playing Mexican Train, a dominoes-like board game that's popular in the community.",
      "\u201cIt turns into a conversation starter for them. It really does connect people,\u201d Marshall said of Rendever's VR programming. \u201cIt helps create a human bridge that makes them realize they share certain similarities and interests. It turns the artificial world into reality.\u201d",
      "Rendever, a privately owned company based in Somerville, Massachusetts, hopes to build upon its senior living platform with a recent grant from the National Institutes of Health that will provide nearly $4.5 million to study ways to reduce social isolation among seniors living at home and their caregivers.",
      "Some studies have found VR programming presented in a limited viewing format can help older people maintain and improve cognitive functions, burnish memories and foster social connections with their families and fellow residents of care facilities. Experts say the technology may be useful as an addition to and not a replacement for other activities.",
      "\u201cThere is always a risk of too much screen time,\" Katherine \u201cKate\u201d Dupuis, a neuropsychologist and professor who studies aging issues at Sheridan College in Canada, said. \u201cBut if you use it cautiously, with meaning and purpose, it can be very helpful. It can be an opportunity for the elderly to engage with someone and share a sense of wonder.\u201d",

      "VR headsets may be an easier way for older people to interact with technology instead of fumbling around with a smartphone or another device that requires navigating buttons or other mechanisms, said Pallabi Bhowmick, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is examining the use of VR with older adults.",
      "\u201cThe stereotypes that older adults aren\u2019t willing to try new technology needs to change because they are willing and want to adapt to technologies that are meaningful to them,\u201d Bhowmick said. \"Besides helping them to relieve stress, be entertained and connect with other people, there is an intergenerational aspect that might help them build their relationships with younger people who find out they use VR and say, \u2018Grandpa is cool!\u2019\"",
      "Rendever CEO Kyle Rand's interest in helping his own grandmother deal with the emotional and mental challenges of aging pushed him down a path that led him to cofound the company in 2016 after studying neuroengineering at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWhat really fascinates me about humans is just how much our brain depends on social connection and how much we learn from others,\u201d Rand said. \u201cA group of elderly residents who don't really know each other that well can come together, spend 30 minutes in a VR experience together and then find themselves sitting down to have lunch together while continuing a conversation about the experience.\u201d",
      "It's a large enough market that another VR specialist, Dallas-based Mynd Immersive, competes against Rendever with services tailored for senior living communities.",
      "Besides helping create social connections, the VR programming from both Rendever and Mynd has been employed as a possible tool for potentially slowing down the deleterious effects of dementia. That's how another Silicon Valley retirement village, the Forum, sometimes uses the technology.",
      "Bob Rogallo, a Forum resident with dementia that has rendered him speechless, seemed to be enjoying taking a virtual hike through Glacier National Park in Montana as he nodded and smiled while celebrating his 83rd birthday with his wife of 61 years.",
      "Sallie Rogallo, who doesn't have dementia, said the experience brought back fond memories of the couple's visits to the same park during the more than 30 years they spent cruising around the U.S. in their recreational vehicle.",
      "\u201cIt made me wish I was 30 years younger so I could do it again,\u201d she said of the virtual visit to Glacier. \u201cThis lets you get out of the same environment and either go to a new place or visit places where you have been.\u201d",
      "In another session at the Forum, 93-year-old Almut Schultz laughed with delight while viewing a virtual classical music performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado and later seemed to want to play with a puppy frolicking around in her VR headset.",
      "\u201cThat was quite a session we had there,\u201d Schultz said with a big grin after she took off her headset and returned to reality.",

    "story": [
      "The United States has announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance funding",
      "GENEVA -- The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration slashes U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies they must \u201cadapt, shrink or die\u201d in a time of new financial realities.",
      "The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is still a generous amount that will maintain America's status as the world\u2019s largest humanitarian donor.",
      "\u201cThis new model will better share the burden of U.N. humanitarian work with other developed countries and will require the U.N. to cut bloat, remove duplication, and commit to powerful new impact, accountability and oversight mechanisms,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media.",
      "The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the U.N. that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.",
      "The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-coordinated programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8 billion to $10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.",
      "\u201cThe piggy bank is not open to organizations that just want to return to the old system,\" Jeremy Lewin, the State Department official in charge of foreign assistance, said at a press conference Monday in Geneva. \"President Trump has made clear that the system is dead.\u201d",
      "The State Department said \u201cindividual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.\u201d Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease, and harmed U.S. soft power around the world.",
      "The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations, including its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid, prompting the agencies to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.",
      "The U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations \u2014 the world\u2019s top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money \u2014 takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.",
      "Fletcher, who has spent the past year lobbying U.S. officials not to abandon U.N. funding altogether, appeared optimistic at the deal's signing in Geneva.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very significant landmark contribution. And a month ago, I would have anticipated the number would have been zero,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd so I think, before worrying about what we haven\u2019t got, I\u2019d like to look at the millions of people whose lives will be saved, whose lives will be better because of this contribution, and start there.\u201d",
      "Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid contributions, needs have ballooned worldwide: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.",
      "The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the Biden administration \u2014 or even during Trump\u2019s first term.",

      "Asked by reporters if the U.S. language of \u201cadapt or die\u201d worried him, Fletcher said, \u201cIf the choices are adapt or die, I choose adapt.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA\u2019s annual appeal for money. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year.

      "At its core, the changes will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be initially targeted, including Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.",

      "Hawaii authorities are cracking down on illegal fireworks after a tragic explosion last New Year's Eve killed six people",
      "HONOLULU -- Mike Lambert heard fewer illegal fireworks exploding in his suburban Honolulu neighborhood in the months after a chain of blasts at a house party last New Year's Eve led to the deaths of six people, including a 3-year-old boy.",
      "As the director of Hawaii's Department of Law Enforcement, Lambert wondered if the tragedy had sparked a shift in Hawaii residents' penchant for igniting illegal fireworks. In some neighborhoods, it would be common to hear loud booms any time of day or night \u2014 for sporting events, celebrations or no apparent reason at all.",
      "But this year, authorities are armed with stiffer laws created in the wake of the tragedy and will be giving out citations to offenders, Lambert warned.",
      "\u201cWe have no delusions that you can have a tragedy New Year\u2019s, you can sign a law in July and then not have anything go off the following year,\u201d he said. Still, he expects that some people will decide not to set off fireworks, either because of last year's deadly accident or the stepped-up enforcement and new laws.",
      "\u201cBefore, you could shoot it off with impunity,\u201d said state Rep. Scot Matayoshi, who authored two of the five anti-fireworks bills. \u201cEveryone knew they weren\u2019t going to bust you.\u201d",
      "Police can now issue $300 tickets to those who shoot off fireworks, while repeat offenders and people whose actions cause serious injury or death could get prison time for felony crimes.",
      "Matayoshi said he began working on legislation the morning after the tragedy, which took place at a New Year's Eve 2025 celebration when crates of illegal fireworks tipped over and ignited in the Aliamanu neighborhood, illuminating the sky in a terrifying set of explosions that left more than a dozen people with severe burns.",
      "\u201cIt affected me a lot,\u201d Matayoshi said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being the neighbor of someone who had basically bombs in their house going off and hurting and killing my kids.\u201d",

      "Firecrackers to ring in the new year have long been popular in Hawaii, but about a decade ago, professional-grade aerials started becoming common.",
      "\u201cYou're seeing fireworks that were meant to be let off at like stadium and hotel events,\" Lambert said. Those pyrotechnics have a 900-foot (274-meter) blast radius, but are exploding in tightly packed neighborhoods where homes are often just a few feet apart, he said.",

      "Noem on Monday posted a video on the social platform X showing DHS officers going into an unidentified business and questioning the person working behind the counter. Noem said that officers were \u201cconducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.\"",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found,\u201d U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement posted.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Her iconic and provocative looks made her an international sex symbol on movie screens, and the embodiment of Marianne, the national emblem of France, her face replicated on statues, postage stamps and currency. Actress Brigitte Bardot (Sept. 28, 1934-Dec. 28, 2025) was also provocative in her activism, particularly in her support for animal rights.",
      "After studying ballet as a child, Bardot became a model, and acted in several films, before becoming an international sensation in 1956's \"And God Created Woman,\" directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim. The film, in which she played a teenage bride, was considered scandalous for her scenes dancing on tables. Bardot's vibrant, feline sensuality led to the press dubbing her a \"sex kitten.\"",
      "But she resented the limelight, blaming chronic depression and a suicide attempt on the constant media attention after the birth of her only child. When she divorced her second husband, Jacques Charrier, he won custody of their son.",
      "She made two dozen more films in the 1960s, including the Oscar-nominated \"La V\u00e9rit\u00e9,\" Jean-Luc Godard's \"Contempt,\" Louis Malle's \"Viva Maria!,\" \"Babette Goes to War,\" \"A Very Private Affair,\" \"Spirits of the Dead,\" and \"Shalako.\" She also recorded songs with Serge Gainsbourg. Yet, she said filmmaking was \"never a great passion of mine,\" and she turned down roles opposite Frank Sinatra, Steve McQueen and Marlon Brando. She retired from acting in 1973; she was just 39.",
      "Bardot's great passion was promoting the rights of animals, creating the Brigitte Bardot Foundation devoted to the prevention of animal cruelty. She shone a light on the slaughter of baby seals, condemned vivisection and bullfights, protested ritualized animal killings in Muslim ceremonies, and called for the end of wearing fur and the sale of horse meat.",
      "\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told the Associated Press in 2007. \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"",
      "She was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1985.",
      "However, her views later proved more controversial, as she opposed immigration, particularly by Muslims, into France. She shifted her politics during her fourth marriage, to a man who'd advised Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front. Bardot was convicted and fined five times in French courts for inciting racial hatred over her opposition to Muslim religious practices.",
      "Just as controversial were her opinions about actresses protesting sexual harassment in the film industry during the rise of the #MeToo movement, calling such remarks \"hypocritical.\"",
      "Reflecting on the tragic ends that some stars, like Marilyn Monroe, had faced, Bardot wrote in her 2019 book, \"Tears of Battle: An Animal Rights Memoir,\" \"Knowing that we are nothing and that this life is but a short passage, each person should spend his or her existence improving nature and the fate of human and animal beings. \u2026",
      "\"What I rejected the most during my life as an actress was the limelight. That intense focus on my little person ate at me from the inside. Narcissism is contrary to my nature. When I had to go to film premieres, and all of the spotlights were pointed at me, I hated it. Whenever it was time to decide whether or not to go, my manager usually had to kick me in the rear. This worship of celebrity \u2013 a life perpetually centered around myself \u2013 suffocated me. For quite some time, I could not accept this idolatry, the fact that I was known and recognized because of a few films or the new image of the modern woman they were forging. The second part of my life liberated me. My fame could at least be useful for something, my time on Earth could ease some animal suffering. Selfishness is cruel. When we no longer pay attention to anyone, how are we supposed to care about the way we behave toward others?\""

      "Rodriguez's lawsuit seeks at least $77 million in damages and accuses Perry of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Rodriguez also sued Lionsgate, which distributed \"Boo! A Madea Halloween\" in 2016, accusing the studio of overlooking Perry's alleged assault.",
      "Perry denied the allegations made in Rodriguez's suit.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Spiro also told the AP: \"I said it before and I will say it again. This is nothing but a $77 million money grab scam.\"",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one text message between Rodriguez and Perry that was sent on Thanksgiving 2024, Rodriguez thanked Perry for helping him through difficult periods in his life and wrote that he appreciated him \"to the moon,\" according to the screenshots. In another series of messages dated Aug. 31 this year, Rodriguez described ongoing health problems, said he lacked health insurance and told Perry he was scared and struggling financially.",
      "The messages were provided to the AP by a source close to the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Rodriguez has.",
      "The lawsuit follows a separate case filed in June by actor Derek Dixon, who alleged Perry groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit was originally filed in California state court and later moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry is based. Perry also has denied Dixon's allegations.",
      "AP reached out to Rodriguez's attorney, Jonathan Delshad, seeking comment on the text messages, but did not receive a response. Delshad also represents Dixon.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0 French politicians were divided on Monday over how to pay tribute to the late Brigitte Bardot who, despite her screen legend, courted controversy \u2014 and convictions \u2014 in later life with her far-right views.",
      "The film star died on Sunday at the age of 91 at home in the south of France. Media around the globe splashed iconic images of her and tributes following the announcement.",
      "Bardot shot to fame in the 1956 film \"And God Created Woman\" and went on to appear in about 50 films, but turned her back on cinema in 1973 to throw herself into fighting for animal rights.",
      "But her links to the far-right stirred controversy.",
      "Bardot was convicted five times for hate speech, mostly about Muslims but also about the inhabitants of the French island of Reunion, whom she described as \"savages.\"",
      "She died before dawn on Sunday morning with her fourth husband, Bernard d'Ormale, a former adviser to the far right, by her side.",
      "\"She whispered a word of love to him ... and she was gone,\" Bruno Jacquelin, a representative of her foundation for animals, told BFM television.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron hailed her as a \"legend\" of 20th century cinema who \"embodied a life of freedom.\"",
      "Right-wing politicians laud Bardot",
      "Far-right figures were among the first to mourn her.",
      "Marine le Pen, whose National Rally party is riding high in polls, called her \"incredibly French: free, untameable, whole.\"",
      "Bardot backed Le Pen for president in 2012 and 2017 and described her as a modern \"Joan of Arc\" she hoped could \"save\" France.",
      "Conservative politician Eric Ciotti suggested a national farewell like the one organized for French rock legend Johnny Hallyday.",
      "He launched an online petition that had garnered just over 7,000 signatures Monday.",
      "Left-wing politicians temper praise and some are sharply critical",
      "But few left-wing politicians have spoken about Bardot's passing.",
      "\"Brigitte Bardot was a towering figure, a symbol of freedom, rebellion, and passion,\"  Philippe Brun, a senior Socialist party deputy, told Europe 1 radio.",
      "\"We are sad she is gone,\" he said, adding he did not oppose a national homage.",
      "But he did hint at her controversial political views.",
      "\"As for her political commitments, there will be time enough -- in the coming days and weeks -- to talk about them,\" he said.",
      "Communist party leader Fabien Roussel called Bardot a divisive figure.",
      "But \"we all agree French cinema created BB and that she made it shine throughout the world,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Lawmaker Sandrine Rousseau, of the left-leaning Greens Party, was more critical.",
      "\"To be moved by the fate of dolphins but remain indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean -- what level of cynicism is that?\" she quipped on BlueSky.",
      "Bardot's remarks on her funeral raised some eyebrows",
      "Bardot said she wanted to be buried in her garden with a simple wooden cross above her grave -- just like for her animals -- and wanted to avoid \"a crowd of idiots\" at her funeral.",
      "Such a burial is possible in France if local authorities grant permission.",
      "Officials in Saint-Tropez said Monday that Bardot will be buried in a seaside cemetery there, without giving a date.",
      "Born on Sept. 28, 1934 in Paris, Bardot was raised in a well-off traditional Catholic household.",
      "Married four times, she had one child, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, with her second husband, actor Jacques Charrier.",
      "After quitting the cinema, Bardot withdrew to her home in Saint-Tropez to devote herself to animal rights.",
      "Her calling apparently came when she encountered a goat on the set of her final film, \"The Edifying and Joyous Story of Colinot.\" To save it from being killed, she bought the animal and kept it in her hotel room.",
      "\"I'm very proud of the first chapter of my life,\" she told AFP in a 2024 interview ahead of her 90th birthday.",
      "\"It gave me fame, and that fame allows me to protect animals -- the only cause that truly matters to me.\"",

      "Martha turned and fled through the crowd, down the wide flight of stone steps, and out into Beaumont Street, looking at nothing but the ground. Three corners later, she found a side road and turned into it. She put her back against the wall and tried to breathe.",
      "She had known there would be ghosts in Oxford. She wasn't afraid of any headless horsemen or nuns haunting the local ruins; it was Charlie, always Charlie she was afraid would find her. There had been times in the first year after her sister's disappearance when Martha's heart would stop as she spotted her through the crowd: the long blond hair, the shapeless cardigan draped over a thin cotton dress. She'd hear a laugh, throaty and sudden, or catch a movement, a walk, a twist in the shoulders, and she'd be certain. Just for a moment. Then the illusion would shatter, and the person she knew to be her sister would resolve into a stranger.",
      "As the years passed, so the ghost of Charlie aged. Now it was women in their midthirties who made Martha stop dead in the streets. In Berlin, once a month perhaps, she'd felt that same flickering certainty before realizing the woman with a child on her lap as she drank a coffee at a sidewalk caf\u00e9 was not her sister, just an echo of Martha's own image of who Charlie might be now, thirteen years after fleeing Oxford and her family.",
      "Martha pressed her palm against the wall behind her. She reminded herself of her therapist's mantra for the moments when she was in danger of being overwhelmed. What can you see now? The shiny cobbles of the side street, the white brick of the wall opposite. What can you feel? The bricks under my fingers, a breeze ruffling my hair. What can you smell? Cooking oil, the Black Opium perfume I put on this morning.",
      "Her breathing slowed.",
      "She pulled the letter out of her bag again and stared at it. Could it be from Charlie? Impossible. What could this Chorus know? Should she burn it? Throw it in the river? Take it to the police?",
      "Ah, the police. She heard the scrape of her mother's chair on the kitchen floor as she leaped up at the sound of the doorbell. They had found Charlie's bike not far from the ring road. Did she hitchhike? How was her PhD going? Martha couldn't remember their faces, just their hands around tea mugs as they sat at the table, the low rumble of their voices as they talked about stress and pressure. Most runaways come back in time, they'd said. They left literature, helpline numbers, and world-weary sympathy behind them.",
      "Martha realized she was at her own front door. Her body had picked her up and carried her here through the gathering dark. She looked up. All the lights were off; her father must be in bed.",
      "Charlie had been living here when she went missing, taking advantage of the space, their mum's cooking, and the glow of parental approval while she slogged through her PhD. Martha had just left for university and was starting to experiment with life out of Charlie's orbit.",
      "As she put her key in the lock, she remembered Alex's shadow moving across the folded letter at the museum. Now it was Charlie's. Always here: the shadows of the past thrown against the walls and floors. She pushed open the door\u2026.",

    "summary": "The band announced Perry Bamonte's death on their official website on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Perry Archangelo Bamonte, longtime guitarist and keyboardist for the influential goth band The Cure, has died. He was 65.",
      "The band announced\u00a0his death on their official website on Friday.",
      "\"It is with enormous sadness that we confirm the death of our great friend and bandmate Perry Bamonte, who passed away after a short illness at home over Christmas,\" the band wrote.",
      "\"Quiet, intense, intuitive, constant and hugely creative, 'Teddy' was a warm hearted and vital part of The Cure story,\" the statement continued. \"Our thoughts and condolences are with all his family. He will be very greatly missed.\"",
      "Bamonte worked with the band in various roles from 1984 to 1989, including as a roadie and guitar tech. He officially joined the band in 1990, when keyboardist Roger O'Donnell quit. It was then that he became a full-time member of the group, playing guitar, six-string bass and keyboard.",
      "Having joined just after the band's mainstream breakthrough, 1989's \"Disintegration,\" Bamonte is featured on a number of The Cure's albums, including 1992's \"Wish\" - which features the career-defining hits \u2033Friday I'm in Love\u2033 and \"High\" - as well as the 1996's \"Wild Mood Swings,\" 2000's \"Bloodflowers\" and 2004's self-titled release.",
      "Bamonte was fired from The Cure by its singer and leader, Robert Smith, in 2005. At that point, he had performed at over 400 shows across 14 years. Bamonte rejoined the group in recent years, touring with the band in 2022 for another 90 gigs.",
      "In 2019, Bamonte was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame alongside the rest of The Cure. He joined The Cure on their North American tour in 2024 when the band reduced tickets to as low as $20 after pledging to make the shows affordable for fans following complaints about exorbitant fees. \u00a0Lead singer Robert Smith said at the time he was \"sickened\" by the Ticketmaster fee debacle.",
      "His last performance with the band was on Nov. 1, 2024 in London for a special one-off event to launch their latest album and first in 16 years, \"Songs of a Lost World.\" The concert was filmed for \"The Cure: The Show of a Lost World,\" a film released in cinemas globally this month. It is also available to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD.",

    "summary": "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center has been canceled.",
    "story": [
      "A planned Christmas Eve jazz concert at the Kennedy Center, a holiday tradition at the Washington, D.C., performing arts center dating back more than 20 years, has been canceled.",
      "The show's host, musician Chuck Redd, told The Associated Press he called off the performance after the White House announced last week that President Trump's name would be added to the facility \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic lawmakers and some scholars, who say the change violates the law. According to the White House, the president's handpicked board approved the decision to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center. The revised name later appeared on the building's facade.",
      "\"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd told The Associated Press in an email Wednesday. Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player who has toured with everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Ray Brown, has been presiding over holiday \"Jazz Jams\" at the Kennedy Center since 2006, succeeding bassist William \"Keter\" Betts.",
      "The center's website lists the show as canceled.",
      "The Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, Roma Daravi, told CBS News in a statement: \"Any artist cancelling their show at the Trump Kennedy Center over political differences isn't courageous or principled \u2014 they are selfish, intolerant, and have failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.\"",
      "In a letter to Redd, Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell called the cancellation a \"political stunt\" and alleged that Jazz Jams have faced \"dismal ticket sales.\" Grenell also said the center plans to seek $1 million in damages.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Redd for comment.",
      "President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law naming the center as a living memorial to him.\u00a0The law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees adding any additional memorials to the site.",
      "The decision to rename the center has drawn steep criticism from congressional Democrats and some members of Kennedy's family. Democratic Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio sued over the renaming Monday, calling it a \"flagrant violation of the rule of law\" and noting that the name can't be changed without an act of Congress.",
      "Grenell, who was appointed by Mr. Trump,\u00a0has argued that the center's status as a memorial to Kennedy wasn't changed.",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been deeply involved with the center named for an iconic Democrat after mostly ignoring it during his first term. He has forced out its leadership, overhauled the board while arranging for himself to head it and personally hosted this year's Kennedy Center honors, breaking a long tradition of presidents mostly serving as spectators.",
      "Numerous artists have called off Kennedy Center performances since Mr. Trump returned to office, including Issa Rae and Peter Wolf. Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a planned production of \"Hamilton.\"",

    "summary": "It marks the second lawsuit in recent months accusing the filmmaker and studio mogul of leveraging his power in Hollywood to make sexual advances.",
    "story": [
      "Tyler Perry was sued for sexual assault by an actor who appeared in \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" marking the second lawsuit in recent months accusing the filmmaker and studio mogul of leveraging his power in Hollywood to make sexual advances.",
      "Mario Rodriguez filed the lawsuit Thursday in California, alleging Perry subjected him to repeated unwanted sexual advances over several years, including sexual battery and assault at Perry's Los Angeles home. Rodriguez is seeking at least $77 million in damages and also has sued Lionsgate, which distributed the 2016 film, accusing the studio of turning a blind eye to Perry's alleged misconduct.",
      "\"Having recently failed in another matter against Mr. Perry, the very same lawyer has now made yet another demand from more than a decade ago which will also be a failed money grab,\" Alex Spiro, an attorney for Perry, said in a statement Friday provided to CBS News.",
      "Lionsgate did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to the complaint, Rodriguez was approached in 2014 by a trainer at an Equinox gym in Los Angeles who said Perry wanted his phone number to discuss an acting role. Perry later encouraged Rodriguez to audition for \"Boo! A Madea Halloween,\" telling him, \"I'm not a bad person to know and have in your corner,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "After Rodriguez was cast, he was invited to Perry's home, where Perry allegedly touched him inappropriately while they watched a movie. The lawsuit describes additional alleged incidents in 2016, 2018 and 2019, including one encounter in which Perry allegedly attempted to unbuckle Rodriguez's pants and another in which Perry placed Rodriguez's hand on his genitals. The complaint says Perry gave Rodriguez $5,000 on multiple occasions following the encounters.",
      "Rodriguez says he resisted the advances and ultimately decided to file suit after learning of similar allegations made by another actor, Derek Dixon.",
      "Dixon sued Perry in June, alleging the filmmaker groped him while Dixon worked on Perry's television series \"The Oval\" and \"Ruthless.\" That lawsuit, which was originally filed in L.A. Superior Court, has reportedly since been moved to federal court in Georgia, where Perry's studio is based.",
      "Rodriguez's lawsuit includes claims of sexual assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.",

      "King Charles III and members of the royal family \u2014 minus his disgraced brother, the former Prince Andrew \u2014 gathered for Christmas at the king's private Sandringham Estate, where they traditionally spend the holiday. In the king's annual Christmas speech, broadcast across Britain and the Commonwealth, he stressed the importance of both unity and diversity.",
      "In the morning, Charles and Queen Camilla, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, their children and extended family members, walked to services at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, in Norfolk, about 100 miles north of London.",
      "Members of the royal family also stopped to greet people in the crowd outside.",
      "Andrew was not present for the holiday gathering, BBC News reported, in the wake of the\u00a0scandal over his ties to the late sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein. He\u00a0did not attend last year either. In October, he was\u00a0stripped of his remaining titles and honors, including prince, and is now known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",
      "Later in the day, the king's annual Christmas Day speech was watched by millions of people in the U.K. and across the Commonwealth, an association of 56 nations with historic ties to Britain.",
      "\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life,\" Charles said in his address, which was recorded earlier this month at Westminster Abbey.",
      "Amid \"division both at home and abroad,\" he said, there are \"values of which we must never lose sight.\"",
      "\"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"",

      "The speech is one of the rare occasions when Charles, 77, can voice his own views and doesn't seek guidance from the government. The remarks typically have a strong religious framework, reflect current issues and sometimes draw on the monarch's personal experiences.",
      "The king's speech was followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir and London's Royal Opera Chorus, in a sign of support for Ukraine in its war against Russia's invasion.",
      "This was Charles' fourth Christmas speech since ascending to the throne after his mother,\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II, died in September 2022.",
      "The address comes just two weeks after Charles made a deeply personal television appearance in which he said \"good news\" from his doctors meant that he would be able to reduce his treatment for cancer in the new year.",
      "The king was diagnosed with a still undisclosed form of cancer in early 2024. Buckingham Palace says his treatment is now moving to a \"precautionary phase\" and his condition will be monitored to ensure his continued recovery.",

      "Mr. Trump celebrated\u00a0the suspension\u00a0of the veteran late-night comic and his frequent critic, calling it \"great news for America.\" He also called for other late-night hosts to be fired.",

      "After yesterday's sharp selloff rattled the market, silver rebounded Tuesday, marking the latest twist in what has been a standout year for the precious metal, with prices more than doubling since January.",
      "Silver futures jumped to $78.03 per ounce on Tuesday, a 10% gain, after Monday's 8.7% decline, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "Gold futures have also soared this year, with the precious metal hitting record highs earlier in December.",
      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",
      "\"Silver saw a record rally in 2025. The 150% increase is significantly higher than that of gold and other assets in the sector,\" noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.",
      "Despite silver's price gains this year, the metal is still far from its inflation-adjusted price record, which was set in 1980, he noted. \u00a0\"To return to that level, silver would have to cost $200 per ounce today,\" he noted.",
      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",
      "The CME raised margin requirements for the contracts in a notice posted Friday. Such moves are designed to protect the exchange by reducing the risk that traders cannot cover their bets if prices swing sharply.",

    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

The rate is slated to drop another 0.05 percentage point to 2.9% in 2027.",
      "Kentucky",
      "Kentucky's individual income tax rate will be cut to 3.5% on Jan. 1, down from its current 4%.

    "summary": "The company's investment in safety prevention comes amid growing concerns over the potential harm of artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI is seeking a new \"head of preparedness\" to guide the company's safety strategy amid mounting concerns over how artificial intelligence tools could be misused.",
      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",
      "OpenAI first announced the creation of a preparedness team in 2023, according to TechCrunch.",

      "Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan said last week that, as President Trump searches for a new chair of the Federal Reserve, maintaining the banking system's independence is paramount.",
      "The market \"will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed,\" Moynihan said in a segment for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that was recorded on Dec. 17 and aired Sunday. \"And everybody knows that.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is the nation's central bank and sets the interest rates. At the agency's December meeting, it cut interest rates for the third consecutive time, reducing the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate at which banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates had dropped to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, but steadily began rising starting in 2022 to curb inflation. The December rate cut put the benchmark interest rates at their lowest level since Nov. 2022.",
      "Throughout this year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Jerome Powell, the current Federal Reserve chairman, whose term is set to expire in May 2026. Although the Fed chair is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, it is an independent agency and there is no legal precedent for Mr. Trump to fire the chair for anything but \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court\u00a0found in 1935\u00a0that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court\u00a0did allow\u00a0Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Moynihan said on \"Face the Nation\" that Mr. Trump has \"great candidates\" for when Powell retires in May. But Moynihan warned that he felt there is \"too much fascination with the Fed\" right now.",
      "\"We're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyers \u2014 all these people drive our economy,\" Moynihan said. \"The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack.\"",
      "Moynihan\u00a0 added that while he believed the Fed had a big role in \"stabilizing the economy,\" but \"you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.\"",

      "Stocks are mostly flat in quiet trading on Friday as investors return from the Christmas holiday. The session falls within the Santa Claus Rally, a historically strong seven-day stretch for stocks that spans the final days of December and early January, though trading volumes are often thin.",
      "The S&P 500 index slipped 8 points, or 0.1%, to 6,923 as of noon EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was down less than 0.1%.",
      "The Santa Claus Rally, which starts on the last five trading days of December and stretches into the first two trading days of January, was first identified by market technician Yale Hirsch in 1972. This year, that means the period began on Dec. 24 and will end on Jan. 5.",
      "\"History shows a clear pattern: since 1950, the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.3% return during this period, with positive results occurring 78% of the time,\" wrote Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, said in Dec. 23 research note.",
      "He added, \"For comparison, the market's typical seven-day average return is just 0.3%, with a positivity rate of 58%.\"",
      "The stock market has already had a strong year, with the S&P 500 climbing nearly 18% since the start of 2025. Wall Street has been buoyed by deregulatory policies from the Trump administration, as well as optimism about artificial intelligence's potential to boost corporate profits.",

      "Gold and silver prices continued to climb, with silver rising more than 4.5% to $74.88 an ounce. Gold was up 1.1%.",
      "Both precious metals have risen this year as investors have looked for safe havens outside of stocks and bonds, and silver has also risen sharply due supply constraints. Miners like Freeport-McMoRan were among the biggest gainers Friday.",

    "summary": "As many Americans head into 2026 with mounting money worries, reviewing your finances now could help put you on firmer footing next year.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are heading into 2026 with serious money worries as an affordability crisis collides with\u00a0stagnant wages, making it more important to take steps to shore up their finances.",
      "On top of that, a major tax overhaul is taking effect under Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" law, or OBBBA, creating opportunities to benefit from the new rules. Other financial changes, such as potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, could also impact your bank account next year, experts say.",
      "About 84% of Americans have new financial resolutions for 2026, including building an emergency fund or opening a high-yield savings account, according to a recent Vanguard survey. That resolve may be spurred by growing unease about the year ahead. About one in three Americans thinks their finances are likely to worsen in 2026, according to Bankrate, the highest share since the personal finance firm began tracking sentiment in 2018.",
      "\"The last few weeks of the year are a great time to review your finances, especially around saving, and it's important to know how you might be impacted by the new tax law,\" Sabino Vargas, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor for Vanguard, told CBS News.",
      "Here are some tips to get your financial house in order as you prepare for the new year.",
      "Prepare for new tax changes",
      "The OBBBA, the spending and tax bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4, establishes new tax deduction rules for many Americans, including seniors and workers who earn tips or overtime.",
      "Under a \"no tax on tips\" provision, employees may deduct up to $25,000 earned in tips before Dec. 31. To qualify for the deduction, it's important that workers track their earnings closely because of the IRS's\u00a0reporting requirements, experts say.",
      "\"Document the numbers,\" Vargas said, noting that the same applies to individuals who work overtime.",
      "Some seniors are also eligible for an enhanced senior deduction beginning in 2025. Individuals who are 65 and older may claim an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 per couple, if they qualify.",
      "Because the deduction phases out for single earners with modified adjusted gross income above $75,000 or $150,000 for joint filers, seniors should check that income measure to assess whether or not they are eligible for the deduction, according to Vargas.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is calculated by finding your AGI, which is on line 11 of your Form 1040, with some deductions and non-taxable items added back in.",
      "Make a budget that will stick",
      "Affordability is a top concern for Americans, whose paychecks aren't keeping pace with inflation. Making a budget that you can realistically follow is a good way to ensure you aren't wasting any money, financial experts say.",
      "It's essential, though, that any kind of budget you design \"matches the way you live,\" Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing director of Inspired Capital, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most budgets fail because they're too aspirational. The ones that stick are automated and grounded in your real patterns,\" she said.",
      "Von Tobel said she prefers the 50/30/20 budgeting rule, which portions half of your take-home pay to essentials; one-third to lifestyle expenses; and 20% to goals such as paying off debt or saving for a vacation.",
      "\"A new year is a perfect time to readdress how your budget aligns with this framework and see where you need to adjust,\" she said.",
      "If the 50/30/20 rule doesn't work for you, there are plenty of other budgeting approaches, including the envelope system and zero-based budgeting. The envelope system sets spending limits for categories like dining out, with that amount placed in cash and used throughout the month.",
      "Zero-based budgeting assigns every dollar of your take-home pay to a specific category \u2014 such as rent, groceries or savings \u2014 until there's nothing left unallocated.",
      "AI tools can remove the self-discipline part of the equation for people and automate savings processes, von Tobel noted.",
      "\"Money management is becoming less about discipline and more about system design. Automate what you can, use tools that give you back time and clarity, and let your financial plan run even when your schedule gets chaotic,\" she said.",
      "Pay down high-interest credit card debt",
      "It's important to prioritize paying down high-interest debt like credit card balances because it's the most expensive to carry and \"can get out of control quickly,\" Vanguard's Vargas said.",
      "When it comes to shedding debt, von Tobel recommends tackling credit card balances with the highest annual percentage rates (APRs) first.",
      "\"Line up your balances by APR, automate all minimum payments and aggressively target the highest-interest line first. Structure beats willpower every time,\" she said.",
      "Another popular strategy for paying down debt is the so-called snowball method. It involves listing your debts by balance and paying off the smallest ones first, regardless of interest rates, to build momentum and stay motivated as balances disappear.",
      "Borrowers have other options for tackling credit card debt as well. One approach is to move balances to a 0% balance transfer card, which can eliminate interest for as long as 21 months. Another is to contact your credit card issuer to ask for a lower annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "Lock in savings rates before they fall",
      "The Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points, its third consecutive cut this year, and hinted at an additional rate cut in 2026.",
      "With at least one additional rate cut expected next year, it may make sense to open a certificate of deposit or a high-yield savings account before rates fall further, said Sam Taube, a lead writer with financial advice site NerdWallet.",
      "Online financial institutions are offering some of the highest rates, with annual percentage yields around 4%.",
      "\"If the Fed lowers rates further from here, they will offer lower fixed yields, so it might make sense to open up a CD of fixed-yield savings instrument like that sooner rather than later,\" he said.",
      "Make sure you're getting the full employer match",
      "If you have a tax-advantaged savings account through your employer, such as a 401(k), financial professionals say it's important to make the most of it. If your company matches employee contributions, aim to contribute at least enough to receive the full match.",
      "Vargas said a good starting point is to find out what level of contribution your employer will match \u2014 typically it's between 3% to 6% of your salary\u2014 and to contribute at least that much to your account.",
      "\"Work toward maximizing that employer match, so you're not leaving money on the table,\" he said.",
      "Setting up an automatic payroll deduction is an easy way to ensure you're contributing to your 401(k), Von Tobel said, adding that \"small, consistent increases create enormous long-term compounding.\"",
      "Before year-end, you can also make a last-minute extra contribution to your 401(k), according to CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger.",
      "Because retirement contributions lower your taxable income, \"you may also reduce your tax bill in April,\" she noted.",

      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record is the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fifth-largest jackpot won in U.S. lottery history.",
      "Thirteen of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "The bigest one this year, Christmas Eve's $1.817 billion Powerball jackpot, is now the\u00a0second-largest U.S. jackpot ever won.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins before that:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a December 23 online\u00a0filing\u00a0that it received a complaint from a Tesla owner asking it to investigate the vehicle's emergency door handles, with the motorist claiming that the \"mechanical door release is hidden, unlabeled and not intuitive to locate during an emergency.\"",
      "The driver claimed he was forced to escape from the vehicle's rear window after the 2022 Model 3 caught fire, according to his account on an Atlanta local television news show.",

      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This isn't the first time the Model 3 has come under scrutiny. In 2023, a couple crashed in Tacoma, Washington, after a design flaw in the Model 3 they were driving caused it to accelerate out of control. A separate issue with the door handle prevented bystanders from helping to rescue the couple, according to court filings. The accident killed the woman, Wendy Dennis, while leaving her husband, Jeff Dennis, severely injured.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:22:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The new tourist tax imposes an 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers to address climate change threats to Hawaii.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge's ruling clears the way for Hawaii to include cruise ship passengers in a new tourist tax to help pay for the impacts of climate change, a levy set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake on Tuesday denied a request seeking to stop officials from enforcing the new law on cruises.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax will generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passengers, starting next year, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, along with a Honolulu company that provides supplies and provisions to cruise ships and tour businesses out of Kauai and the Big Island that rely on cruise ship passengers. Among their arguments is that the new law violates the Constitution by taxing cruise ships for the privilege of entering Hawaii ports.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers also argued that the tax would hurt tourism by making cruises more expensive. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "\"Cruise tourism generates nearly $1 billion in total economic impact for Hawaii and supports thousands of local jobs, and we remain focused on ensuring that success continues on a lawful, sustainable foundation,\" association spokesperson Jim McCarthy said in a statement.",
      "According to court records, the plaintiffs will appeal. They asked the judge to grant an injunction pending an appeal and requested a ruling by Saturday afternoon, given that the law takes effect Jan. 1.",
      "Hawaii will continue to defend the law, which requires cruise operators to pay their share of transient accommodation tax to address climate change threats to the state, state Attorney General Anne Lopez said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. government intervened in the case, calling the tax a \"scheme to extort American citizens and businesses solely to benefit Hawaii\" in conflict with federal law.",

    "title": "We asked experts to rate the U.S. economy in 2025. Here's what they said.",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/economists-grade-us-economy-2025/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:27:44 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy remained on track this year, defying the gloomiest predictions. That doesn't mean Americans are thrilled with how things are going.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy has been tested by a barrage of challenges in 2025, from sharply higher U.S. tariffs that drove up inflation and rattled consumer confidence, to rising unemployment amid a slowdown in hiring.",
      "Despite those headwinds, the economy has continued to chug along, defying early-year warnings from some economists that the nation could be headed for a recession or that the Trump administration's tariffs would reignite runaway inflation.",
      "The biggest surprise of the year has been the economy's durability, according to experts. Economic growth has surged\u00a0to its fastest pace in two years, inflation has risen less than feared and the stock market has climbed to\u00a0fresh highs.",
      "\"This has been another year of resilience for the economy,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"The economy has grown at a pretty steady pace.\"",
      "Yet Pearce hastens to add that the economy, although it has navigated some tricky waters, is \"not spectacular\" as the year comes to a close, assigning it a grade of a B or B-. Other experts who spoke with CBS News also graded the economy in the B range.",
      "That may strike many consumers as generous. Three-quarters of Americans surveyed by CBS News earlier this month said they would give the U.S. economy a C, D or F, while just 25% assigned it an A or a B. Recent consumer confidence surveys also indicate that many Americans are downbeat about the economy, mainly due to stubbornly high prices.",
      "The disconnect partly reflects the differences in how consumers and economists tend to judge the nation's economic performance. While financial pros tend to focus on macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, inflation and unemployment, consumers are more likely to assess the economy based on pocketbook issues like food prices and health care costs \u2014 both of which have risen in 2025.",
      "The White House said the economy has improved from last year under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"Although much work remains, the American economy is leaps... better now than it was a year ago under Joe Biden: cooled inflation, private-sector job growth, cheaper essentials like gas, lower taxes, and trillions in investments flowing in to make and hire in America,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He added, \"As President Trump's economic agenda continues taking effect, Americans can rest assured that 2026 will be even better.\"",
      "A turbulent year",
      "The economy has been marked by pronounced volatility and uncertainty in 2025, ranging from the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs to an\u00a0alarming downturn in growth\u00a0in the first three months of the year.",
      "\"It's rare that we've seen a president come in and, with a unified Congress, have such immediate impacts on the economy,\" Pearce said. \"Not all of those are impacting the economy right away, but we've seen a lot of those policies generate a lot of uncertainty.\"",
      "For instance, the Republicans' \"big beautiful bill\" act, signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, will likely impact the economy in 2026, with consumers expected to receive juicier tax refunds.",
      "Other effects of the new law could work against some consumers. Perhaps most concerning is the expiration of Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits, which experts warn will sharply drive up health insurance premiums for millions of Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, it's been a banner year for investors as the boom in artificial intelligence pushed the stock market to a succession of record highs. At the same time, the bullish sentiment on Wall Street has fueled questions about whether a possible\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0could turn to bust if the enormous investment in the technology fails to deliver the promised gains in productivity and corporate profits.",
      "Life on the \"K\"",
      "Economic turmoil often impacts consumer sentiment, making people feel less confident about their finances, economists have long noted. That dynamic has led experts to describe the economy this year as \"K-shaped,\" in which higher-income consumers spend robustly \u2014 thanks in part to the\u00a0strong stock market\u00a0\u2014 even as lower- and middle-income consumers\u00a0pull back.",
      "And it's no wonder. Although inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, prices remain elevated, squeezing many Americans and making it hard for them to cover even basic expenses, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "It isn't just routine purchases that are straining consumers \u2014 it's also the barriers in the way today of reaching once ordinary financial goals, such as buying a first home, saving for retirement or even just paying off debt, added Chen Zhao, head of economic research at online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "When it comes to homeownership, evidence of that barrier is visible in the median age of first homebuyers today \u2014 that hit 40 this year, a record high, according to the National Association of Realtors. With home values near all-time highs and mortgage rates hovering around 6.3%, many younger Americans are feeling priced out, she said.",
      "\"This situation that we're in right now, where [housing] affordability has gotten to be the worst it's really ever been in recent memory \u2014 and significantly worse than before the pandemic \u2014 it's really unfortunate for the younger generation,\" Zhao said. \"It means delaying the American dream for a lot of folks.\"",
      "In 160 U.S. cities, at least one-fifth of middle-class residents can't afford to live in that area, after factoring in local income levels and price differences, according to Brookings, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Hiring slowdown",
      "Another pressure point is the labor market, where hiring has slowed throughout 2025. The U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, its highest level in four years.",
      "Layoffs also\u00a0jumped to 1.1 million this year through November, up 54% from a year earlier and the highest level since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "While job seekers are finding it tougher to get a foothold in today's labor market, it's proving particularly challenging for young people, who are facing a decline in job listings and competition from more experienced workers, experts said.",
      "Cooling job growth in the second half of the year is partially a reflection of persistent economic uncertainty, which has led many businesses to throttle hiring. Some businesses are also trimming jobs as they invest in AI, which can perform some tasks previously handled by employees.",
      "\"Any type of uncertainty is going to lead to slower business decisions, whether it's hiring or investment,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Labor market headwinds in 2025 have prompted the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate three straight times since September. By lowering borrowing costs, the Fed is aiming to encourage businesses to expand and hire.",
      "Slower hiring and rising layoffs could pose a risk to consumer spending, which drives nearly two-thirds of economic activity, economists note.",
      "\"A slower labor market leads to slower income growth, which eventually ends up pulling consumer spending lower,\" Daco said.",
      "Muted tariff impact",
      "One of the biggest economic surprises of 2025 came with President Trump's sweeping tariffs, announced in April on what he termed \"liberation day.\" The plan caused U.S. stocks to plunge\u00a0and stoked fears that the levies would reignite inflation.",
      "Yet despite such concerns, tariffs so far have had a more muted impact on inflation than initially feared. That's partly because U.S. companies, which pay the import duties to the federal government, stockpiled goods before the tariffs kicked in and absorbed some of the costs rather than passing them on to consumers.",
      "\"Generally speaking, the economy outperformed expectations in the face of several large supply shocks,\" Daco said.",
      "Still, inflation remains sticky. The Consumer Price Index, which stood at 3% in January, remains near the same level as of November. Oxford Economics' Pearce estimates that the stepped-up import duties added 0.5 percentage points to the nation's inflation rate this year.",

      "The average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association (NEADA). Those who use electricity for heating were projected to see an even steeper jump of 12.2%, with the average bill swelling from $1,090 to $1,233, the group found.",

Audits are performed by certified home energy auditors, according to energystar.gov. Look to local government agencies or your utility company for home energy assessment tips.",
      "Tackle obvious leaks. Justin Castronova, a lead inspector at First Choice Inspectors in Illinois, told CBS News consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi that the best place to start is with doors and windows. Castronova recommends using caulk to seal gaps, maintaining weather stripping for doors and windows, and using spray foam around electrical outlets (make sure to turn off your power first).",
      "Invest in energy-efficient appliances. That can save you from $10 to $50 a month, depending on the size of the appliance and how many you have, Castronova said.",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security says it's replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with an approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\"The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which was challenged in court.",
      "At least one federal judge has upheld it, French news agency AFP reports. In a 56-page opinion Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell wrote that the president has \"broad statutory authority\" to address \"a problem he perceives to be a matter of economic and national security.\"",
      "At least two additional suits against the fee are ongoing.",
      "The president also rolled out a $1 million \"gold card\" visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \"in line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\"",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",
      "The new system will \"implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\" foreign workers, according to Tuesday's press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master's degree or higher.",

    "summary": "A prominent California farmer was arrested in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, authorities said.",
    "story": [
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro, Calif. and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family's tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn't immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "A Navajo County grand jury indicted Michael Tuesday and deputies got an arrest warrant for him, CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV reported.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region's early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri's forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",
      "The Abattis were sparring over finances, with Kerri telling the court the couple had lived an upper-class lifestyle during more than three decades of marriage. They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn't maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple's three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney's fees, court filings show.",
      "\"I am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\" she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn't afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700 and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\"The income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\" Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti's family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \"The Morality of Deceit.\"",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

    "summary": "Brian Cole was arrested and charged earlier this month for allegedly planting two pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on the eve of the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot is in court Tuesday as his lawyers and federal prosecutors argue over whether he should remain detained in the lead-up to a criminal trial.",
      "Justice Department lawyers have argued in court papers that Brian Cole, 30, poses an \"intolerable risk\" to the community and should continue to be detained. He faces two criminal charges stemming from the alleged planting of two improvised explosive devices in the vicinity of the RNC and DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C., nearly five years ago. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges.",
      "Prosecutors urged the court to keep Cole in custody \"considering the extreme and profoundly serious nature of his crimes, the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the years he has spent deceiving those around him to avoid accountability, and the intolerable risk that he will again resort to violence to express his frustration with the world around him.\"",
      "The Justice Department said in court filings Sunday that Cole has confessed to constructing the bombs, filling them with explosive power and setting their timers to detonate. Prosecutors argued that he evaded law enforcement and avoided accountability \"for actions that endangered lives and created a widespread sense of fear and terror.\"",
      "The devices were planted on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, and were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, as law enforcement in Washington, D.C., were overwhelmed when a mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The bombs did not detonate, but the FBI said they were viable. The perpetrator who planted the devices eluded federal investigators for years, even as the FBI continued to release new video and information in hopes of a break in the case. Then, earlier this month, authorities arrested Cole after investigators looked at cellphone provider records, purchasing history and vehicle movements.",
      "Cole told investigators during an interview after his arrest that he had driven to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5 to attend a protest over the outcome of the 2020 election and did not tell his family he was going to a protest in support of Mr. Trump, prosecutors said. He said that after the 2020 election, he began following the issue on YouTube and Reddit \"when it first seemed like something was wrong\" and \"stuff started happening,\" according to Justice Department filings. He said that \"if people feel that their votes are like just being thrown away, then . . . at the very least someone should address it,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that when asked about his motive, Cole said \"something just snapped\" and he wanted to target \"the parties\" because \"they were in charge.\" He denied that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to certification of the 2020 election results, which took place on Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Cole's lawyers have argued in court papers that he should not be kept in custody while awaiting a trial, as he has lived \"without incident\" for the past four years. They said that Cole has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Level 1 is the mildest form of Autism Spectrum Disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",
      "Cole's legal team also argued that he has no criminal history and said there is \"zero evidence\" to suggest he would flee ahead of a trial. He agreed to home detention with GPS monitoring, and would be supervised by his grandmother, according to court filings.",
      "\"There is no pattern of alarming conduct either prior to or after the alleged conduct at issue in this case. Mr. Cole does not pose a danger to the community,\" they wrote.",
      "Cole's lawyers have also asked the magistrate judge overseeing Tuesday's hearing to order any and all confessions or admissions Cole made to investigators to be turned over to his legal team.",
      "Cole, a Virginia resident, was arrested earlier this month after the yearslong search for the perpetrator of the alleged plot. In court documents, the FBI said Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge, Virginia, and works in a bail bondsman's office.",
      "His lawyers said that Cole \"can continue being a productive member of society upon release\" because he can return to his job, \"which will provide immediate structure and accountability.\"",

      "In a\u00a0radio interview Friday, the president said the U.S. hit the facility \"very hard\" two nights before. The president didn't offer the location of the facility, but he has been threatening land strikes in Venezuela following a string of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.",
      "\"We just knocked out, I don't know if you read or you saw, they have a big plant or a big facility where they send, where the ships come from,\" Mr. Trump said after calling into \"Sid and Friends in the Morning\" on 77 WABC Friday. \"Two nights ago, we knocked that out, so we hit them very hard.\"",
      "On Monday, he added that it had struck what he called \"the implementation area,\" adding, \"that is no longer around.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 13:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Kennedy Center board, whose members were appointed by President Trump, voted earlier this month to add his name to the building.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some artists have announced cancellations of their upcoming performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, following the addition of President Trump's name to the building. Richard Grenell, president of the Kennedy Center, referred to the artists who canceled their shows as \"far left political activists\" who \"were booked by the previous far-left leadership.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center board, whose members were selected by Mr. Trump, voted earlier this month to add his name to the building. An official name change\u00a0appears to require approval by Congress. The president and his allies assumed control of the board earlier this year, sparking the decision by some artists not to perform at the institution. In March, Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a production of \"Hamilton\" that was supposed to be part of the events planned around the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Recently, more artists announced cancellations, including the jazz ensemble The Cookers, scheduled to perform on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Jazz was born from struggle and from a relentless insistence on freedom: freedom of thought, of expression, and of the full human voice,\" The Cookers said in a statement on their website, although they didn't cite a specific reason for their cancellation. \"Some of us have been making this music for many decades, and that history still shapes us. We are not turning away from our audience, and do want to make sure that when we do return to the bandstand, the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it.\"",
      "Some artists who announced cancellations were more blunt.",
      "The New York City-based Doug Varone and Dancers company cited the renaming of the building as the catalyst for their decision to pull out of April shows.",
      "\"While we totally disagreed with the takeover by the Trump Administration at the Kennedy Center, we still believed it was important to honor our engagement out of respect for both Jane Raleigh and Alicia Adams, who curated a first-rate dance season, as well as for the dance audiences in DC,\" the dance company wrote. \"However, with the latest act of Donald J. Trump renaming the Center after himself, we can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"",
      "A post shared by Doug Varone and Dancers (@dovadance)",
      "American Folk singer Kristy Lee posted on Instagram last week to announce the cancelation of her concert scheduled for Jan. 14, citing the decision to \"rebrand\" American history.",
      "\"I won't lie to you, canceling shows hurts,\" Lee wrote. \"This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck. When American history starts getting treated like something you can ban, erase, rename, or rebrand for somebody else's ego, I can't stand on that stage and sleep right at night. America didn't get built by branding. It got built by people showing up and doing the work. And the folks who carry it don't need their name on it, they just show up.\"",
      "Grenell responded to the cancellations in a post on X.",
      "\"The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership,\" he wrote on X. \"Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs.  Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome.  The arts are for everyone and the left is mad about it.\"",
      "When Kennedy Center leadership was revamped earlier this year, the president was trying to move away from what he views as \"woke culture.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:19:05 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

    "summary": "The removal by a U.S. military cemetery in the Netherlands of two displays recognizing Black troops who fought in World War II has spurred anger there.",
    "story": [
      "Margraten, Netherlands \u2014 Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.",
      "Sometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.",
      "The move came after President Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. \"Our country will be woke no longer,\" he said in an address to Congress in March.",
      "The removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. \"The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,\" he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment.",
      "One display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.",
      "Some 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.",
      "Cor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.",
      "Linssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn't learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier.",
      "\"When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I was the only dark child at school.\"",
      "Linssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels.",
      "\"It's an important part of history,\" Linssen said. \"They should put the panels back.\"",
      "After months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations - the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News - this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump's DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.",
      "The White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.",
      "The American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation \"did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''",
      "It also said that the panel about Pruitt was \"rotated\" out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten.",
      "Chair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is \"strange\" that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.",
      "\"Something has changed in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Bovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier's birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.",
      "Both the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November, a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them.",
      "The Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch.",
      "On America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands.",
      "In his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.",
      "When Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ''what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were. And that includes the Netherlands,\u2033 said Linda Hervieux, whose book \"Forgotten\" chronicles Black soldiers who fought on D-Day and segregation they faced back home.",
      "The removal of the panels, she said, \"follows a historical pattern of writing out the stories of men and women of color in the United States.\"",

      "Standing alongside Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Mr. Trump also claimed dozens of other countries that supported the peace deal are ready to \"wipe out\" the terrorist group if Hamas doesn't disarm, but he did not name any of them.",
      "The president said of Hamas, \"They're going to be given a very short period of time to disarm.\" Standing alongside Netanyahu, Mr. Trump added, \"And we'll see how that works out. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be in charge of that, from our side. But if they don't disarm, as they agreed to do \u2014 they agreed to it \u2014 then there will be hell to pay for them. And we don't want that. We're not looking for that. But they have to disarm within a fairly short period of time.\"",
      "\"We have 59 countries that signed on, big countries, countries that are outside of the Middle East as you know the Middle East,\" the president added. \"They want to go in and wipe out Hamas. They don't want Israel, they don't need Israel; they want to do it because it's the right thing to do. Because they were for the deal, based on the fact that Hamas pledged, they swore, that they were going to disarm. Now, if they're not going to disarm, those same countries will wipe out Hamas.\"",

Hamas has refused to disarm and has not yet returned all Israeli hostage remains, while Israel has recently conducted some strikes in Gaza. The family of Israeli Sgt. Maj. Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose remains have not yet been returned, was at Mar-a-Lago Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also said ahead of the meeting that he would support an Israeli attack on Iran, should Iran begin again to build up its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The president praised Netanyahu, telling reporters \"he's a wartime prime minister who's a hero.\" And the president said he has spoken with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about a pardon for Netanyahu, who is facing bribery and fraud charges.",
      "\"How do you not give a pardon, you know?\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think it's a very hard thing not to do it. ... He tells me it's on its way.\"",
      "Herzog's office, however, said in a statement, \"There has not been a conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted.\" The statement also said that Herzog spoke several weeks ago with a representative of Mr. Trump who had \"inquired about the U.S. President's letter\" and who was told \"any decision on the matter will be made in accordance with the established procedures.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Netanyahu ahead of Mr. Trump's meeting. Netanyahu's visit comes a week after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, met with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss next steps in the peace plan.",
      "The Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect in November, more than two years after the war began with the attack by Hamas-led terrorists on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.",
      "This was the sixth meeting between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu since the president took office in January.",
      "Netanyahu's visit came on the heels of Mr. Trump's\u00a0meeting\u00a0Sunday at Mar-a-Lago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the U.S. president continues to try to to broker a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. After that meeting, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy said they're nearly in agreement on a peace plan for Ukraine, and the Ukrainian leader praised what he called \"strong security guarantees\" from the U.S. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Mr. Trump spoke before and after his meeting with Zelenskyy, hasn't shown a willingness to compromise on his territorial demands. Russia attacked Kyiv shortly before Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "Mr. Trump has been spending the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago estate, mixing in golf with meetings with world leaders. The president will return to the White House after New Year's Day.",

      "\"Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations. Two male narco-terrorists were killed,\" Southern Command said.",
      "The U.S. military has hit at least 30 alleged drug vessels in the region since early September, killing 107 people \u2014 part of a monthslong campaign of boat strikes near Latin America. President Trump has argued that boat strikes have been effective at quelling drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, but critics have questioned the president's legal authority to carry out the strikes.",

      "Mr. Trump had said Friday in a\u00a0radio interview\u00a0that the U.S. hit the facility \"very hard\" two nights before. The president didn't offer the location of the facility, but he has repeatedly floated land strikes on alleged drug traffickers in Venezuela and other countries.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump was referring to a drug facility in Venezuela. CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",

      "The U.S. has built up a heightened military presence in the region over the last few months, and Mr. Trump has also said he is instituting a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil vessels entering or exiting Venezuela, impacting a key economic sector for the South American country.

    "summary": "The U.S. announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as the Trump administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014 The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Trump's administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
      "The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States' status as the world's largest humanitarian donor.",
      "\"This new model will better share the burden of U.N. humanitarian work with other developed countries and will require the U.N. to cut bloat, remove duplication, and commit to powerful new impact, accountability and oversight mechanisms,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media.",
      "The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.",
      "The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.",
      "Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease, and harmed U.S. soft power around the world.",
      "The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.",
      "The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations \u2014 the world's top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money \u2014 takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.",
      "Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change \u00a0have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.",
      "The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration, or even during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Now, the idea is that Fletcher's office \u2014 which last year set in motion a \"humanitarian reset\" to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent \u2014 will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid.",
      "The United States wants to see \"more consolidated leadership authority\" in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.",
      "Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office \"are going to control the spigot\" on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.",
      "\"This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars \u2014 providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.",
      "U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA's annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year.",
      "\"The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.\"",
      "\"Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.'s most critical work,\" the department added. \"Today's agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump's commitment to remaining the world's most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.\"",
      "At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.",
      "One of the world's most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Mr. Trump's as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan.",
      "The project, months in the making, stems from Mr. Trump's longtime view that the world body has great promise but has failed to live up to it and has, in his eyes, drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.",
      "Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, \"At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.",

      "Russia's top diplomat said Monday, hours after President Trump touted progress toward a ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine, that Moscow's negotiating position would change following an alleged attempt by Ukraine to attack one of President Vladimir Putin's far-flung residences.",
      "Sergey Lavrov, a close Putin confidant and Russia's longtime foreign minister, said the Kremlin had already decided on retaliatory measures against Ukraine, which he did not elucidate.",
      "Lavrov accused Ukraine of launching dozens of drones to target Putin's residence in the Novgorod region, hundreds of miles from Moscow and near Russia's western borders with the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Lavrov said 91 Ukrainian drones were intercepted and there were no casualties and no damage caused.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly issued a statement calling the Russian accusation \"lies\" and an effort to undermine the peace talks being spearheaded by the Trump administration.",
      "President Trump met with Zelenskyy Sunday at the American leader's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, after which Mr. Trump claimed again that Putin was committed to peace and that, \"Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed.\"",
      "That remark drew considerable attention, given that Putin and his aides have repeatedly\u00a0dismissed Ukraine's right to even exist as an independent nation.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt\u00a0said in a social media post that Mr. Trump held another \"positive call with President Putin concerning Ukraine\" on Monday, but she offered no further detail of the discussion, and it was unclear whether the presidents had spoken before or after Moscow accused Kyiv of targeting Putin's residence.",
      "Lavrov did not say how or when Russia would change its negotiating position in the talks to end the war, nearly four years since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which his government still refers to only as a special military operation. But Putin himself said earlier on Monday, during a meeting with his military commander, that \"in the near future, it is necessary to continue the offensive.\"",
      "Putin even voiced optimism that Russian forces would be able to seize control of all four regions of eastern Ukraine that he declared dominion over about seven months into the full-scale invasion \u2014 Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas, along with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Ukraine and its European partners have long warned that Putin's ongoing engagement with the Trump administration on Ukraine is really a play for time, as his military further expands its control over Ukrainian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy said after his Sunday talks with Mr. Trump that he believed the U.S. and Ukraine had reached about 90% agreement on a draft 20-point peace plan, but both men acknowledged there were lingering issues. These include Russia's unflinching demand that it be given sovereignty over the entire Donbas.",
      "Ukraine, along with its European partners, has consistently rejected the idea of rewarding Russia's unilateral assault with territorial concessions, noting that it could set a dangerous precedent unseen in Europe since the landgrab by Adolf Hitler at the beginning of what would become World War II.",
      "Despite Putin having shown no willingness to bend on his demand for an expansion of Russia's territory, Mr. Trump claimed Sunday that Ukraine and Russia were \"closer than ever before\" to a peace settlement.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you for making time.",
      "BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's great to be here. Good to see you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about the state of the economy, because our CBS polling is showing that the most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?",
      "MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.",
      "BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--",
      "MOYNIHAN\u00a0 \u00a0Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?",
      "MOYNIHAN \u00a0 Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --and medium size businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.",
      "MOYNIHAN: The sheer size, the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera. What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.",
      "BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--",
      "MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.",
      "BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.",
      "BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.",
      "BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.",
      "BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--",
      "BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--",
      "BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.",
      "BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.",
      "MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.",
      "BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.",
      "BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --even\u2013",
      "BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --20 years ago--",
      "BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--",
      "BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?",
      "MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--",
      "BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.",
      "MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 Happy Holidays, thank you.",
      "BRENNAN: Happy Holidays to you.",

    "summary": "Brian Cole told investigators he believed that the 2020 election had been tampered with and he felt \"someone needs to speak up,\" the DOJ alleges in court documents.",
    "story": [
      "The man\u00a0accused of planting pipe bombs\u00a0outside the Democratic and Republican national committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, told investigators that he believed that the 2020 election had been tampered with and he felt \"someone needs to speak up,\" the Justice Department said in a court filing Sunday.",
      "The Justice Department said that over the course of 90 minutes, Brian Cole, who was arrested in Virginia on Dec. 4, \"walked the interviewing agents in detail through his construction, transportation, and planting of the pipe bombs.\"",
      "Cole, 30, has yet to enter a plea. He has been charged with transplanting and planting the two IEDs at the DNC and RNC headquarters, neither of which exploded.",
      "Cole is due in court on Tuesday for a detention hearing.",
      "Cole's attorneys on Monday asked that all evidence be turned over sooner rather than later, including any copies of an alleged confession. His attorneys on Sunday also asked for Tuesday's hearing to be not just a detention hearing but also a probable cause hearing.",
      "According to the court documents from prosecutors, Cole told investigators that he wasn't targeting the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021. Supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, interrupting the counting of the electoral votes and delaying the official validation of the 2020 election results. Mr. Trump has falsely claimed that he won the 2020 election.",
      "Cole allegedly told investigators that he disliked both political parties and didn't consider himself a \"political person.\" But after the 2020 election, \"when it first seemed like something was wrong\" and \"stuff started happening,\" he began following the issue closely on YouTube and Reddit and felt \"bewildered,\" the court documents said.",
      "\"I didn't agree with what people were doing, like just telling half the country that they \u2014 that their \u2014 that they just need to ignore it,\" Cole told investigators, according to the court documents. \"I didn't think that was a good idea, so I went to the protest.\"",
      "Cole allegedly told investigators that \"someone up top\" needed to \"speak up\" if people \"feel that, you know, something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with, is being, you know, being \u2014 you know, relegated null and void.\" Cole said he felt the \"people up top, public figures,\" should not \"ignore[e] people's grievances\" or call them \"conspiracy theorists,\" \"bad people,\" \"Nazis,\" or \"fascists.\" Instead, \"if people feel that their votes are like just being thrown away, then . . . at the very least someone should address it,\" the court documents said.",
      "Prosecutors said Cole told them that he bought the bomb-making materials between 2018 and 2020. He told investigators the idea to use pipe bombs came from his interest in history, specifically The Troubles in Northern Ireland, in which pipe bombs were frequently used over a three-decade period of conflict between Protestants and Catholics.",
      "According to the court documents, when asked about his motive, Cole said \"something just snapped\" after \"watching everything, just everything getting worse.\"",
      "Investigators also say Cole told them he wasn't thinking of the reaction if the devices detonated, although he hoped there would be news about it. He said he was \"pretty relieved\" that the bombs didn't explode.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation, as 2025 comes to an end, we will look ahead to 2026 and what's on the horizon for the economy, national security, and more.",
      "2025 is almost behind us. It's been a year filled with change that's turned Washington norms upside down and a year filled with news of great tragedy, but also moments of true triumph. What's ahead for Americans in 2026 when it comes to the economy?",
      "We will turn to Wall Street and the chairman and CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, for the industry's economic forecast. We will look at national security threats and challenges from the increasing use of artificial intelligence with CBS News contributors Samantha Vinograd and Chris Krebs.",
      "And we will wrap up and look to the new year with our CBS News Washington correspondents in our annual roundtable.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin again with the top issue this year for Americans, the economy.",
      "Earlier this month, we spoke with the head of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, about the state of the economy as we head in to 2026.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our CBS polling is showing that the \u2013 most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN (CEO, Bank of America): Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story when you look at the upper- income brackets.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you see data of actual transactions.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We not only see it in the aggregate. We also see it in pieces.",
      "And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend on Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's \u2013 it's up 4, 4.25, 4.5 percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing.",
      "And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending at a little faster growth rate, but still growing, and in the middle and upper faster.",
      "So, you know, what they're telling you is what they feel. What they're actually seeing, is spending is reasonably solid \u2013 reasonably solid heading into the end of the year. And it's been kind of going along like that all of December.",
      "Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are \u2013 you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending. They have good credit quality. They are employed. And we can see wages growing in \u2013 as people's paychecks come in at a 3 percent clip. So it's a \u2013 it's pretty solid right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper-income brackets? Is it that K-shaped economy some people talk about?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, our team puts the \u2013 looks at this.",
      "Yes, it \u2013 the growth rate difference is higher, but all of \u2013 all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and that's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think people have sentiment that's low, but spending that's higher?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's \u2013 you hear about it. You've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that \u2013 because we had a very \u2013 a very strange process from '20 through to now.",
      "We had COVID lockdown. Then we had all the stimulus. Then we had high inflation. And then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's \u2013 they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times.",
      "And so they saw the inflation in '20 \u2013 in, yes, '20 and '23 and '24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist. And it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into '26, having come through '25, the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at it, they think inflation keeps working its way down.",
      "But it's \u2013 it's what people feel. And you can't discount that. And it's also, at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on.",
      "But \u2013 but it's \u2013 it's not widespread. At 4 \u2013 you know, 4.6 percent unemployment is the last number they published. That's still in the \u2013 in - - our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so, in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a big concern. But Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de-escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I think, if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses and medium-sized businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was shock. There was shock on liberation day.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There was shock, the size, sheer size, at the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera.",
      "What you have seen now, as time has moved on, it's sort of a 15 percent on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the U.S. or won't commit to lowering their non-tariff barriers and things like that.",
      "And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean or foreign CEOs, you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be \u2013 drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15 percent.",
      "To go from a 10 percent across the board to 15 percent, for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to \u2013 it's starting to de-escalate, in that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15 percent here, 17 \u2013 different numbers.",
      "When you put China, China's a different question, because of the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just A.I., all that stuff. It's a very different case.",
      "And I think also, between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly, in the world, you can see sort of the end point here, and now they've just got to \u2013 it's got to work through the system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B-of-A is the largest small business lender.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So we're the largest small business lender.",
      "And as you're \u2013 if we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very \u2013 because rates had gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow at floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them, I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit?",
      "But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit. So they're more \u2013 their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do \u2013 to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern.",
      "It's not that they agree with them or are disagree with them. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So, if you think across four policy regimes, tax, trade, tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation, you have seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability.",
      "How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable, they're here, so give me a set of rules and I will go play with them. But I need to be clarified of what the rules are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it.",
      "One is, the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So, if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So that's slowing down that activity.",
      "The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country, some single-family \u2013 you could have single-family, multi \u2013 small multifloor units, things like that, or even more, bigger multifamily in major cities. But there's a universal housing shortage, because, for so many years, it's been hard to get housing permitted.",
      "And so the advice I give to anybody is, you're probably not going to see the 10-year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of 3, and but the 10-year rate stays between 4 and 4.5, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than it is today.",
      "But if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that. It's probably the solution.",
      "Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people with 3 percent mortgage rates, that's not going to be a change. And, by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low a rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession.",
      "So we shouldn't be cheering for 3 percent mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down as a good thing.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Because there's 60 million \u2013 there's 130-odd million households in America. Half of them don't have a mortgage. This is \u2013 this whole lock-in question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: \u2026 is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring \u2013 rental affordability is a question, or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that.",
      "So it's a very complex thing. But simplistic \u2013 simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie.",
      "Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The treasury secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake.",
      "Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But \u2013 but, for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, I don't talk about client relationships.",
      "But, look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And \u2013 and the administration knows that and Secretary Bessent knows it. That guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30-year mortgage, because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee, for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels there are more advantageous to borrow.",
      "You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be OK, or a lot of years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So that guarantee is critical to the U.S. getting fixed- rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability.",
      "And then they've run the things pretty responsible since the financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason \u2013 one of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them.",
      "And as soon as rate \u2013 prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful of all that. And I think the \u2013 but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been.",
      "They're a great company. They're an iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May.",
      "How much does that job matter to the consumer? How do you explain that?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things.",
      "So the president's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's \u2013 he should do it.",
      "There's \u2013 in my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not \u2013 we're a country \u2013 we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer \u2013 all these people drive our economy.",
      "The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get \u2013 since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: That's what they're supposed to do. That went away a number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID.",
      "They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and prices. But, other than that, you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't worry about all this, you know, hand- wringing of political interference with the Fed once that new position is filled?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The market is a \u2013 will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And everybody knows that.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS News and The Free Press have secured a partnership with Bank of America \"For Things That Matter,\" a series of town halls and debates designed to revive conversation on topics that matter the most.",
      "We will be back in one minute with more of our interview.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with more of our interview with the chairman and CEO of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You pushed back pretty hard in that moment.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six-page report.",
      "There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been \u2013 have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on.",
      "So, if you read the Web site, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was, that's not what was going \u2013 never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clearer, so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others.",
      "And we'll \u2013 we'll look at anybody who feels we \u2013 believe me, they \u2013 people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, you closed my account. Why? And we can tell them.",
      "But I think people are forgetting, the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And they \u2013 and, believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be \u2013 fail as a company, and, therefore, we're going to write you up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration, that kind of social pressure, you're saying?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Even 20 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty years ago. OK.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up.",
      "And the second thing is that \u2013 that, for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at $10,000. And you have two things. If it goes above that, you have to report on it and if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972.",
      "That number would be $80,000 today. So what we thought was material then\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes, and so there's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to \u2013 if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful.",
      "So there's sort of the ESG side of it. Those things, I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff, because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter, and then the reputation risk, which, to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this issue, the president himself really dug into. And he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, is \u2013 do you know what he's talking about?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: We \u2013 I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we banked everybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said it on television about you.",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: I know that. I know that. People \u2013 if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television, it \u2013 I would be rich. So, in the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers.",
      "We have tens of thousands \u2013 we are the biggest small business lender in the country, period, end, stop. You know, and so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's \u2013 it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their \u2013 and their points of view.",
      "But, look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center, and America ought to feel good about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think the \u2013 things are copacetic now?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have put this behind you with the White House?",
      "BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview is available on our YouTube channel, our Web site, and our podcast.",
      "And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look ahead to the top national security threats in 2026, we're joined now by two CBS contributors.",
      "Chris Krebs was director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency during the first Trump administration, and Sam Vinograd, a former counterterrorism official at the Department of Homeland Security during the Biden administration.",
      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Good to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have heard so much in the past year about A.I., artificial intelligence, in virtually every sector of the business world and national security.",
      "You have said A.I., it's not just an app on your phone. It's not just a computer chip. It's energy. It's data centers. There are some really complex challenging \u2013 challenges here. What are you looking at in the year ahead?",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, starting exactly there, just the diversity of sectors that are impacted by A.I., it is an incredibly complex global value chain.",
      "It's chips. We have heard a lot about the Nvidia H200 chips and then competing against Huawei in China. It is software.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Trying not to sell them to China and the debate over\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Right. Right. And there's a significant tension in the national security space on, should we give China chips or should we deprive them of chips?",
      "And it seems for now that the side that wants to give China chips and then extract value and revenue from it, that team has won for now. But, broader than that, there's software. There's infrastructure. There's data centers. There's water. There's thermal management. There is training. There's work force.",
      "So it is not just about the app that manifests on your phone. It's the entirety of the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's reshaping so many sectors of the economy.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: It's reshaping the way virtually every business operates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: If you go talk to CEOs, they're talking about how they can be an A.I.-first company. Are they happy with the results that they're seeing right now? Absolutely not. But they know, two years, we're going to face this equivalent of a Cambrian explosion of A.I. capabilities across the economy.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: And, Margaret, if I can just add, it's not just reshaping how businesses operate. It's also reshaping how governments operate.",
      "If you look at A.I., nothing is zero sum in national security. It's not a net positive or a net negative. A.I., and I have seen this firsthand, is changing the way that investigations are performed. It allows law enforcement officials to comb through so much data and to do investigations more efficiently.",
      "It is allowing the U.S. military to use certain autonomous vehicles and weapons that can reduce civilian risk, if managed appropriately, and more effectively engage in war fighting. It's changing the way the intelligence community is able to both collect and review data.",
      "At the same time, it is opening up a whole new host of threats. A.I. doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors. It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said something that was a little frightening to me. You said, as technology gets more advanced, the ability to anonymously hurt people exponentially increases.",
      "What does that mean on the homeland security front?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: A.I. gives actors, not just in the homeland, but literally all around the world, to very credibly pretend to be somebody else. It is upending the whole notion of what identity is in today's day and age.",
      "A.I. is allowing bad actors to very authentically and credibly pretend to be someone else, both with their voices, with their faces, and then to deliver threats in a way that actually resonates. So it's impersonating someone, but then also using A.I. to figure out where vulnerabilities are in a system and what a target audience or a target entity is going to respond to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want both of you to weigh in on this, but, Chris, we heard just last month the first documented case of a fully automated cyberattack by a foreign government. This was the A.I. chatbot Claude.",
      "They said the suspected Chinese hackers had used their A.I. to breach about 30 global organizations, just to do it really quickly and efficiently, as I understand it. So whose job is it to protect against it? Is it the government's job or is it a private corporation to figure out how to protect against all these risks you laid out?",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think there are two things in play right now.",
      "One is, what's the regulatory environment look like that requires the safe use of these platforms? And we have seen a pullback on the regulatory front from this administration. The Biden administration had an A.I. executive order that required certain notifications and safety testings. That's been pulled back.",
      "Instead, we're in this innovation-first model. And so\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was light touch. This is even \u2013 this is no touch, you're saying.",
      "FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: This is \u2013 yes, I \u2013 again, this is really putting the full weight of the government behind the U.S. technology industry winning the global A.I. race. That is the top priority.",
      "And so what's happening in the meantime is, you would normally say, OK, the states are going to regulate, but now you have the White House weighing in saying states cannot regulate in the A.I. space. And, again, CEOs want some guidance. They want governance. So they have to do it themselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, switching gears for a moment here, we're looking at 2026, a huge number of mass gatherings in the United States. You have got FIFA, World Cup, the Super Bowl, the nation's 250th anniversary. Are you concerned about homeland security in the new year?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: There are always a lot of threats facing the homeland. What is materially different in the coming year, in 2026, is that there are structural issues that I fear make us more vulnerable to successful attack.",
      "That includes the fact that the United States probably for the first time in our history is no longer viewed globally as the leader and poster child for rules-based international order. Other actors feel like they don't have to follow the rules if we're not going to. That could introduce new threats.",
      "At the same time, there has been a degradation in the systems of government that do identify threats and then work to prevent them, not just today, but over the medium and longer term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break here, come back on the other side of it. More \u2013 more things to worry about in the new year in just a minute.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half-hour, more of our conversation on national security, plus our annual CBS News correspondents roundtable.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Samantha Vinograd and Chris Krebs. Both are CBS contributors.",
      "Sam, you worked in Homeland Security under the Biden administration. And we heard at that time that the administration was just hamstrung unless Congress did something on the immigration front. This administration took a completely different approach. I mean let's just look at what they did this year. Mass deportation campaign. Significant change to legal immigration. Border crossings are now at the lowest level in decades. Secured major funding for ICE and CBP. Half a million arrests conducted. They repealed protected status for many immigrants. And now there's a travel ban or restrictions on about 39 countries total.",
      "What is the longer-term impact of these kind of really massive changes?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, to be clear, the Biden administration did take action in July of 2024 to try to curtail unlawful immigration. December 2023 we saw almost 250,000 individuals unlawfully crossing our border. By January of 2025, that was down about 85 percent before Biden took office \u2013 left office as a result of his executive order.",
      "We are seeing, and likely will continue to see, a systemic dismemberment of lawful immigration pathways to the United States. And the administration has shared a variety of reasons for that. Failure for refugees, for example, to assimilate into the United States. Security concerns and other matters.",
      "But if you just look at the numbers, immigrants today account for over 15 percent of the U.S. labor force. Millions of people in this country are immigrants. And if we look at the economic impact of removing that talent, removing those people from this country, there will certainly be an economic impact, as well as, I do believe, a technological and innovative impact as we look at the individuals coming here on student visas, on H-1B visas, and more. They are direct contributors to innovation in this country. And I fear that we risk losing out on that and getting the balance wrong between security, economic growth, and innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on that point, Chris, the administration says you can financially sort of arrange for more H-1B visas. These are the highly skilled workers. Are we losing a competitive edge because of the restrictions?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: I think this has been in play for several years, in fact. Going back even several administrations. What the Chinese, for instance, have figured out is that if they put their own capital into their Silicon Valley equivalent, they can retain high Chinese talent that has typically gone to the U.S. Gone to university in the U.S. and then stayed here because our venture capital space is booming. The Chinese have figured it out.",
      "And what we're seeing now, back to the risks piece, is that the Chinese are using their financial resources to pull highly advanced, highly capability engineers out of the U.S. and European workforce, bringing them back, and then copy much of the technology that's giving us the edge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there is a connection here, back to immigration policy changes, too?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, I want to ask you about another big event that's coming, the midterm races. We have seen a lot of political violence or concern about political violence in months past. The assassination of Charlie Kirk, the murder of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. We saw Governor Shapiro's Pennsylvania residence burnt. These are just some of the high-profile things. There's more that's happened. What do you anticipate? Should we be fearful of a political environment and elections?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Politically motivated violence is probably the threat that keeps me up the most at night, particularly as we look at the year ahead. Undoubtedly, the United States is viewed as one of the largest sources of conflict and homes of conflict in the world today, which is a seismic change if you think about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Heading into the midterms and, of course, looking ahead to the presidential, we have already seen terrorism becoming a tool of choice in the homeland to settle both personal grievances and political vendettas. The reasons for that are, of course, enhanced rhetoric, but also, frankly, enhanced access to like-minded individuals, enhanced access to tactics and techniques online. The ability to find out where your target is going to be and when, and more. The rhetoric needs to be calmed down.",
      "But there also needs to be the right investments in critical infrastructure protection, and in, appropriately, identifying foreign influence to try to stoke up political violence and other threats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And there have been actual cutbacks in the things you just laid out as necessary tools in terms of the FBI, their task force on foreign influence operations.",
      "Chris, the agency you used to work for, CISA, it's seen, not just budget cuts, but just open jobs here.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is going on? Why not build up protection going into an environment like this?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: It's just not a priority right now for this administration. I think they believe that there were missteps in the past on with the Biden administration, and even the first Trump administration did on identifying, encountering information operations, particularly as they relate to elections.",
      "But we know that these threats are real. We know these risks are real. And we also know that they're multiplying. Sam talked earlier about the exponential explosion of capabilities in the hands of bad actors and the explosion of bad actors themselves because of tools like A.I.",
      "When I think about the '26 midterms, we are going to be two to three generations beyond what the current A.I. model capabilities are. So, they're only going to be more sophisticated, more advanced, more capabilities in the hands of those foreign and domestic that want to disrupt our ability to choose who represents us in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, both, for sharing your expertise with us.",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Thank you.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's ahead in 2026? It's time to check in with some of our exhausted Washington beat reporters, including chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, who also hosts \"The Takeout,\" on our 24/7 digital network, chief Washington analyst Robert Costa, justice correspondent Scott MacFarlane, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, and senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs.",
      "It's great to have you all here.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Exhausted but also energized. You know, we've got to keep the energy going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, keep the coffee coming, Major. We're going to need it for the year ahead.",
      "But we looked at the polling, Costa. I want to get your take on this. Because a majority of Americans disapprove of the president's signature policy issue, immigration. It came in at 54 percent. His approval of his handling of the economy, which is his other signature issue he was elected on, is now at 37 percent according to our latest CBS poll.",
      "Is the president frustrated with the perception of his first year?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Margaret, the Democrats are looking at those numbers, and that's why they're making their whole argument to the country of affordability. They see real vulnerability for this administration on the economy. But inside the White House, I would say the phrase is not affordability, it's self-confidence.",
      "This president, behind the scenes, is telling his advisers to stay steady, to not have alarm. There is frustration about press coverage. There's frustration about how Republicans in Congress seem to be so worried ahead of the midterm. Some headed for the exits with retirement.",
      "The president, again and again in private conversations with his top officials, is insistent that the trade policy is working. He's not going to pull off \u2013 pull back on tariffs at all. He believes he can have a new start with a new Fed chairman coming in in 2026. And so, it's President Trump at the center, driving this conversation and staving off any concern.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jennifer, what do your sources tell you about how the president's going to tackle specifically some of these economic issues?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Housing costs are really eating into wages. And the president has been shown polling that showed this is a really hot issue for both Democratic voters and Republican voters alike. The president has about a dozen proposals before him that have all sorts of ideas of how to lower mortgage costs, decrease rental costs. They're thinking about creating a new savings account that would be similar to the 529 college savings account, but this would be for first-time home buyers. They're talking about federal lands, opening up federal lands for new housing construction. He has scheduled meetings down in Florida while he's there for Christmas break to talk to his advisers about this. I'm told that the president wants the housing cost issue to be the very first big policy decision that he launches in the new year, sometime January or February.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Focusing in on that biggest contributor to inflation, shelter costs.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, tariffs are at the very heart of the president's agenda. And we know the court is expected to decide soon on the legality on a certain set of the president's tariffs that he justified by citing fentanyl. Should the White Gouse be so confident that they're going to win?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I certainly didn't get that impression from the argument. I mean the chief justice, Justice Gorsuch, solid conservatives were asking questions, really skeptical of the administration's arguments on tariffs. It was kind of a tale of two arguments, though, because as that case kind of progressed, then they started asking questions skeptical of the other side.",
      "So, I mean, I think that anyone that comes out and like confidently predicts how the court's going to rule in this case is just wishful thinking. I mean it could be very close. I could see a 5-4 ruling, Trump losing. I could see a 6-3 decision, perhaps, Trump wins.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, on the legal front, the president has gone after some perceived enemies in things like executive orders, announced, you know, stripping away of security clearances, even of people who don't even currently have one, but he's made his point. But his attempt to prosecute opponents hasn't been quite as simple. What are you seeing?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: He campaigned a year ago arguing he'd end the weaponization of the Department of Justice against political enemies. And what did we see in 2025? An awful lot of investigations and criminal cases against his political critics. We saw these flailing attempts to charge James Comey and Letitia James, the New York attorney general. Those cases were dismissed. And twice in the past few weeks grand juries have said no to efforts to try to resuscitate the case against Letitia James. Grand juries rarely say no to prosecutors. That was a profound thing.",
      "And I think more fundamentally, Margaret, it's not just the cases or the investigations or the calls. It's the changes inside of the Department of Justice. They have purged out prosecutors who handled cases Trump doesn't like, bringing in potentially new voices that critics would say are poised to weaponize against critics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And a tacit administration from the White House chief of staff that there is a retribution campaign in the article written by \"Vanity Fair\" Chris Whipple. Susie Wiles said, yes, she was going to try to put a time limit on that, unsuccessfully, but acknowledging what Scott just said is a real thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on this question, though, of limits to authority, Major, we've seen some limits to congressional power, or at least willingness to exert its authority. Do you think it's going to change this year?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The political contours of the Congress going into 2026 are going to really flow through how anxious are Republicans about their own ability to obtain re-election. And do they have to create some noticeable difference between themselves and the president and the Trump administration Through all 2025 the answer to that was, no, we're good, we're staying in with Trump. But if the atmosphere, which currently exists, leading to some retirements, continues to worsen, you will see more congressional pushback. Does it manifold in a way that stops Trump and the administration cold? No, but it complicates things. And if anyone leaves the cabinet, the idea of who the nominee is and what their Senate confirmation prospects are will be filtered through this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Costa, on that point, do you see departures from the cabinet happening?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's very possible, though President Trump is not one to just make a move immediately because there's a flurry of news, negative news, about one of his cabinet members. We see he often takes his time to make some of the decisions, and he doesn't like to be pressured to get rid of anybody.",
      "But there are so many people in the so-called MAGA universe who wants these slots. And they are able to get access to this president. A lot of these cabinet officials I've spoken to privately, and their top aides, say they're going to try to make it through the midterm elections and then leave. But if the president is feeling pressure to make some kind of significant change ahead of the midterms, I wouldn't rule anything out based on my reporting.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I can tell you, Margaret, this is not cabinet members, but this \u2013 in the West Wing, that main pack of inner circle advisers is going to stay intact. And that includes Susie Wiles and Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt, on the way down, that core group of people. They're not going anywhere. I think we will see some senior advisers in the West Wing leave. Just keep in mind that there are some advisers that have young children. So, they might be leaving for family reasons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, there is a perception that the Supreme Court has shown limited resistance to the president's efforts to expand the powers of the executive. Do you think that's fair? And do you think on that big case that's coming with birthright citizenship, that they will find in his favor?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I think there is the perception because of the way the court has handled some of these emergency requests from the Trump administration to step in to these cases and put lower court rulings on hold while the litigation plays out. So, that would let the policies take effect. And the Trump administration has had tremendous success, I mean well over 20 such requests have been granted to let some of these policies go into effect, whether it's on deportations, on immigration stops, mass firings. But those are temporary, interim orders. And the administration has been very strategic and only appealing these adverse rulings from courts below that it thinks it can win. Again, these are just interim orders. Once we do get to the merits, I don't think Trump's going to win all these cases. And I certainly don't think he's going to win the birthright citizenship case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: No, absolutely not. He may not win the tariff's case. Right now it's looking great for Trump in the Supreme Court, but it may look very different come June when we have kind of gotten through some of these big, landmark rulings.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And, Jan's beat is going to be at the center of the 2026 politics, tariffs, Voting Rights Act, and birthright citizenship. All will have massive, political consequences.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, and so many social issue cases as well. Transgender participation in girl's sports. We've got two huge gun rights cases. This is a highly consequential term for the court.",
      "And, you know, it's going to be in conflict, I think, with President Trump by the end of the term because he's not going to like all these rulings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with more from our panel.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with our panel.",
      "Predictions for 2026.",
      "Robert Costa.",
      "ROBERT COSTA: My motto as a reporter is assume nothing. And we're very early in the 2028 presidential cycle and discussion. Governor Newsom of California, Governor Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Pritzker of Illinois, the list goes on. But my prediction is, in 2026, we're going to see some names we're not discussing at all start to emerge as possible contenders for the Democrats in 2028. Some celebrities might come into the mix. And one name I would venture, based on some recent reporting, Stephen A. Smith, the sports personality, is talking to people in the Democratic Party about whether he has a future. Whether he runs or not, TBD. But something to watch, celebrity politics in the age of Trump on both sides.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan Crawford.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I'm going to revisit a prediction I made last year when I kind of confidently said that Justice Alito was probably going to retire and give President Trump his fourth nomination to the Supreme Court. Sources close to Justice Alito say he has not made up his mind. He, in many ways, is too young to retire. He's 75 years old. But then there's the concern that he's too old not too, because if he cares about his legacy, and he is that intellectual leader of the conservative wing, if he cares about his legacy with a Republican in the White House or a Republican- controlled Senate, this year would be the best time for him to retire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I think Americans will begin or increasingly feel the effects of DOGE. There's an awful lot of people that lost their jobs in the last 12 months. A lot of long-time career civil servants who were good at delivering products for the American citizens. In my world, the Department of Justice, there have been 5,000 people. That can't help but slow down prosecutions, investigations, and doing right by American people. And that's true across the board in Washington.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jennifer.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: Fraud investigations. I think you're going to see this administration really dig in deeper to try to find evidence that proves fraud in various government programs. People cheating the system, trying to fleece taxpayers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Major.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, I'm going to be the glue for this process because we have predictions and underreported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We get \u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mine merge together.",
      "So, prediction is, data centers and A.I. expansion will be an underappreciated but potent political issue in 2026. Eight executive ordered signed by President Trump related to artificial intelligence just behind tariffs and immigration. He has made himself the A.I. president. Yet, let me give you some names of state, Indiana, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, all in one way or another, on the Republican side, are up in arms about either A.I. regulation, lack thereof, or data centers and their implications. Sixty percent in our most recent poll, nearly 60 percent of Americans believe artificial intelligence will not increase jobs but take jobs away. And 44 percent in our most recent poll want more regulation of A.I. than less. This is a wedge issue that Democrats have identified because it is not cohered on the MAGA side. The president has already put down his chips on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Underreported . What did you want to report that you couldn't?",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: I love, to Scott's point, I'm going to build on it Elon Musk and the DOGE team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JENNIFER JACOBS: They promised to cut the federal workforce. We're at the end of the year. So, what is the tally for the year? It is 271,000 workers. That's according to the latest jobs report that showed how many workers the federal government shed. So, just to put that into perspective, that's roughly the population of Madison, Wisconsin. So, imagine if every single person in Madison, Wisconsin, were to lose their job, either ousted or they leave their job.",
      "So, the bottom line on DOGE is that they did not succeed in cutting overall government spending, but they did fulfill their mission to trim the federal headcount by roughly about 10 percent. And I think it's going to be important to track those workers and to see where they end up, what their fates are, because they are not being scooped up in the private sector, at least not yet.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There was some attention, but not the requisite attention to the thermonuclear use of pardons in 2025. Blanket pardons, family pardons, preemptive pardons. Is the next person going to bring it back to what we've enjoyed over the past couple centuries, the traditional controversies around pardons?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, under reported?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: You know, there is a narrative that the Supreme Court is corrupt. I mean we saw that emerge in the wake of the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe versus Wade. And now we see it, that they're in the tank for Trump. Not only is that narrative overreported, it is patently false, and it is dangerous for the institution and the public's faith and confidence in the rule of law. This is a conservative Supreme Court. It has been a conservative Supreme Court for 20 years. People can disagree and do disagree with their opinions, but it's profoundly wrong to call it \u2013 or say corruption where there, in fact, is none.",
      "What's underreported is any understanding of what this court's been doing for the past 20 years. Its views of its role, vis-a-vis the other branches. How it sees the law. How it's trying, in its focus, to restore some kind of accountability and our constitutional structure.",
      "Again, this is a court that is functional. It is consistent. They are nine justices. They don't necessarily see the Constitution the same way by any means or how to interpret federal law. There's a struggle over the proper way to interpret the Constitution. But that is as it should be. And I think as we approach our 250th anniversary of this country, it's important to think about the court and their rule of law as the justices are doing, especially if we hope to keep democracy intact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a big statement, Jan, if we hope to keep democracy intact. My goodness.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: If we lost \u2013 if the public loses confidence in the rule of law, I don't know what that means for democracy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And that's why I think some of the rhetoric about corruption is so, so profoundly irresponsible.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And it causes threats.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, yes. Which, again, I mean the justices are under tremendous, and federal judges as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's all institutions, including for (ph) the state.",
      "Bob Costa, your underreported?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Just briefly. One of the most striking stories of the year politically, Zohran Mamdani. Young \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's underreported?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, no. Let me \u2013 let me make my point. One of the most striking stories was Mamdani's victory. The big question a lot of people have is, well, how does this happen? How does this young, Democratic socialist win in New York City? In my view, the most underreported story of the year is how someone laid the foundation for Zohran Mamdani. Someone near 50 years older, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent, Democratic socialist of Vermont, had what's called a \"Fight Oligarchy Tour\" earlier in 2025, drawing thousands of people in red states and blue states. Sanders enabled Mamdani, and others like him, to start to gain traction for Democratic socialism inside of the Democratic construct in this country in 2025.",

      "The market \"will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed,\" Moynihan said in a segment for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that was recorded on Dec. 17 and aired Sunday. \"And everybody knows that.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is the nation's central bank and sets the interest rates. At the agency's December meeting, it cut interest rates for the third consecutive time, reducing the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate at which banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates had dropped to nearly zero during the COVID-19 pandemic, but steadily began rising starting in 2022 to curb inflation. The December rate cut put the benchmark interest rates at their lowest level since Nov. 2022.",
      "Throughout this year, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his displeasure with Jerome Powell, the current Federal Reserve chairman, whose term is set to expire in May 2026. Although the Fed chair is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, it is an independent agency and there is no legal precedent for Mr. Trump to fire the chair for anything but \"for cause.\" The Supreme Court\u00a0found in 1935\u00a0that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court\u00a0did allow\u00a0Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Moynihan said on \"Face the Nation\" that Mr. Trump has \"great candidates\" for when Powell retires in May. But Moynihan warned that he felt there is \"too much fascination with the Fed\" right now.",
      "\"We're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium-sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyers \u2014 all these people drive our economy,\" Moynihan said. \"The idea that we are, like, hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack.\"",
      "Moynihan\u00a0 added that while he believed the Fed had a big role in \"stabilizing the economy,\" but \"you shouldn't know they exist, quite frankly.\"",

    "story": [
      "As prosecutors contend with a massive trove of documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, President Trump suggested Friday the Justice Department is spending too much time on the issue \u2014 but said prominent Democrats linked to Epstein should be named.",
      "The Justice Department has released scores of records on Epstein over the last week, responding to a law requiring it to publish its files on Epstein by Dec. 19. The files cover more than 20 years worth of investigations into the disgraced financier, and highlighted the relationships he cultivated over the years with well-known people like Mr. Trump and former President Bill Clinton \u2014 neither of whom have been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "And on Wednesday, the department announced that the federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan had discovered upwards of 1 million more records \"potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.\" It said that combing through the newly discovered documents and making necessary redactions could take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump addressed the discovery on Truth Social late Friday, writing: \"Now 1,000,000 more pages on Epstein are found. DOJ is being forced to spend all of its time on this Democrat inspired Hoax. When do they say NO MORE, and work on Election Fraud etc.\"",
      "The president went on to allege that Democrats, not Republicans, are \"the ones who worked with Epstein.\"",
      "\"Release all of their names, embarrass them, and get back to helping our Country,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has long been wary of the Epstein issue, periodically calling it a \"hoax\" and arguing that Republican lawmakers who supported the release of more records on Epstein had fallen for a diversion tactic spearheaded by Democrats.",
      "He eventually said last month that Republicans should vote for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated the files' release, writing, \"it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax.\"",
      "Simultaneously, the president has zeroed in on Democrats with links to Epstein. In mid-November, he asked the Justice Department to investigate Epstein's ties to Clinton and two other Democrats. The department had previously said in July that there is no evidence to justify prosecuting any uncharged third-parties in the Epstein case.",
      "Last week's initial release of Justice Department files on Epstein featured multiple photos of Clinton, including an image of the former president sitting in a hot tub and several images of him at events with celebrities like Michael Jackson.",
      "Another release of files earlier this week included references to Mr. Trump. One 2020 email from a federal prosecutor said flight logs revealed that the president flew on Epstein's private jet \"many more times\" than was previously known.",
      "The files do not indicate wrongdoing on the part of Clinton or Mr. Trump. A Clinton spokesperson has long acknowledged that the former president traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but said he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes.",
      "A Clinton spokesperson\u00a0on Monday\u00a0pushed the Justice Department to release \"any remaining records\" in the Epstein files that mention Clinton or include a photo of him, arguing the former president has nothing to hide.",
      "Mr. Trump ran in the same social circles as Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, but says he cut off ties with Epstein many years ago. The president called the release of photos of Clinton and others a \"terrible thing\" on Monday, saying that many people who appear in images with Epstein \"really had nothing to do with\" him.",
      "\"I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown. I think it's a terrible thing,\" the president told reporters. \"I think Bill Clinton's a big boy, he can handle it. But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago ... and they're highly respected bankers and lawyers and others.\"",

    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

      "According to the job posting, the new hire will be paid $555,000 to lead the company's safety systems team, which OpenAI says is focused on ensuring AI models are \"responsibly developed and deployed.\" The head of preparedness will also be tasked with tracking risks and developing mitigation strategies for what OpenAI calls \"frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.\"",
      "\"This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,\" CEO Sam Altman wrote in an\u00a0X\u00a0post describing the position over the weekend.",
      "He added, \"This is a critical role at an important time; models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges.\"",
      "Reached for comment, an OpenAI spokesperson referred CBS News to Altman's post on X.",
      "The company's investment in safety efforts comes as scrutiny intensifies over artificial intelligence's influence on mental health, following multiple\u00a0allegations\u00a0that OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT, was involved in interactions preceding a number of suicides.",
      "In one case earlier this year\u00a0covered by CBS News, the parents of a 16-year-old sued the company, alleging that ChatGPT encouraged their son to plan his own suicide. That prompted OpenAI to announce new safety protocols for users under 18.",
      "ChatGPT also allegedly fueled what a lawsuit filed earlier this month described as the \"paranoid delusions\" of a 56-year-old man who murdered his mother and then killed himself. At the time, OpenAI said it was working on improving its technology to help ChatGPT recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations and guide people toward real-world support.",
      "Beyond mental health concerns, worries have also increased over how artificial intelligence could be used to carry out cybersecurity attacks. Samantha Vinograd, a CBS News contributor and former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, addressed the issue on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "\"AI doesn't just level the playing field for certain actors,\" she said. \"It actually brings new players onto the pitch, because individuals, non-state actors, have access to relatively low-cost technology that makes different kinds of threats more credible and more effective.\"",
      "Altman acknowledged the growing safety hazards AI poses in his X post, writing that while the models and their capabilities have advanced quickly, challenges have also started to arise.",
      "\"The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025; we are just now seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,\" he wrote.",
      "Now, he continued, \"We are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused, and how we can limit those downsides ... in a way that lets us all enjoy the tremendous benefits.\"",
      "According to the job posting, a qualified applicant would have \"deep technical expertise in machine learning, AI safety, evaluations, security or adjacent risk domains\" and have experience with \"designing or executing high-rigor evaluations for complex technical systems,\" among other qualifications.",

She underwent grueling treatment, including chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants and a clinical trial for a type of immunotherapy, but the cancer returned and she was eventually given a prognosis of one year to live, she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg was the second of Caroline Kennedy Sclossberg and Edwin Schlossberg's three children.",
      "She published the essay announcing her diagnosis in November, 62 years to the day after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. She wrote that she struggled with the impact of her diagnosis on her family.",

      "Schlossberg married George Moran in September 2017. The pair met as undergraduates at Yale University, The New York Times reported, and wed in a ceremony at her family's home on Martha's Vineyard. They had two children, a son born in 2022 and a daughter born in May 2024.",

Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't.

    "summary": "Brian Cole was arrested and charged earlier this month for allegedly planting two pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Virginia man accused of planting two pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic Party headquarters on the eve of the\u00a0Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot is in court Tuesday as his lawyers and federal prosecutors argue over whether he should remain detained in the lead-up to a criminal trial.",
      "Justice Department lawyers have argued in court papers that Brian Cole, 30, poses an \"intolerable risk\" to the community and should continue to be detained. He faces two criminal charges stemming from the alleged planting of two improvised explosive devices in the vicinity of the RNC and DNC headquarters in Washington, D.C., nearly five years ago. He has not yet entered a plea to the charges.",
      "Prosecutors urged the court to keep Cole in custody \"considering the extreme and profoundly serious nature of his crimes, the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the years he has spent deceiving those around him to avoid accountability, and the intolerable risk that he will again resort to violence to express his frustration with the world around him.\"",
      "The Justice Department said in court filings Sunday that Cole has confessed to constructing the bombs, filling them with explosive power and setting their timers to detonate. Prosecutors argued that he evaded law enforcement and avoided accountability \"for actions that endangered lives and created a widespread sense of fear and terror.\"",
      "The devices were planted on the night of Jan. 5, 2021, and were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021, as law enforcement in Washington, D.C., were overwhelmed when a mob of President Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The bombs did not detonate, but the FBI said they were viable. The perpetrator who planted the devices eluded federal investigators for years, even as the FBI continued to release new video and information in hopes of a break in the case. Then, earlier this month, authorities arrested Cole after investigators looked at cellphone provider records, purchasing history and vehicle movements.",
      "Cole told investigators during an interview after his arrest that he had driven to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5 to attend a protest over the outcome of the 2020 election and did not tell his family he was going to a protest in support of Mr. Trump, prosecutors said. He said that after the 2020 election, he began following the issue on YouTube and Reddit \"when it first seemed like something was wrong\" and \"stuff started happening,\" according to Justice Department filings. He said that \"if people feel that their votes are like just being thrown away, then . . . at the very least someone should address it,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that when asked about his motive, Cole said \"something just snapped\" and he wanted to target \"the parties\" because \"they were in charge.\" He denied that his actions were directed toward Congress or related to certification of the 2020 election results, which took place on Jan. 6, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Cole's lawyers have argued in court papers that he should not be kept in custody while awaiting a trial, as he has lived \"without incident\" for the past four years. They said that Cole has been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1, and obsessive compulsive disorder. Level 1 is the mildest form of Autism Spectrum Disorder, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.",
      "Cole's legal team also argued that he has no criminal history and said there is \"zero evidence\" to suggest he would flee ahead of a trial. He agreed to home detention with GPS monitoring, and would be supervised by his grandmother, according to court filings.",
      "\"There is no pattern of alarming conduct either prior to or after the alleged conduct at issue in this case. Mr. Cole does not pose a danger to the community,\" they wrote.",
      "Cole's lawyers have also asked the magistrate judge overseeing Tuesday's hearing to order any and all confessions or admissions Cole made to investigators to be turned over to his legal team.",
      "Cole, a Virginia resident, was arrested earlier this month after the yearslong search for the perpetrator of the alleged plot. In court documents, the FBI said Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge, Virginia, and works in a bail bondsman's office.",
      "His lawyers said that Cole \"can continue being a productive member of society upon release\" because he can return to his job, \"which will provide immediate structure and accountability.\"",

    "story": [
      "New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows flu cases continuing to spike around the country, with some areas seeing record cases of the illness.",
      "The CDC estimated there have been at least 7.5 million flu cases this season as of Dec. 20, as well as at least 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths. There have been eight flu-related pediatric deaths, the CDC said.",
      "The CDC\u00a0says\u00a032 jurisdictions are showing \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of flu. Last week, just 17 jurisdictions were in those categories. Jurisdictions include all 50 states and some territories, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City.",
      "The New York State Department of Health said\u00a0that it had seen about 71,000 cases for the week that ended Dec. 20 \u2014 the most ever recorded in one week since the department began tracking the illness in 2004. There were over 3,600 flu hospitalizations recorded in the state during the week.",
      "The Massachusetts Department of Public Health also recorded \"high\" flu activity. Boston announced a 114% increase in recent flu cases, with children seeing the biggest increase in cases. Meanwhile, a spike in cases prompted a Minnesota school to shift to online learning before Christmas. CBS News Minnesota reported that the state had seen 113 flu-related hospitalizations in 2025, more than double the number recorded last year.",
      "Experts have expressed concern about this year's flu season. A new subtype of influenza A called H3N2 is spreading quickly. The CDC reported that of 2,086 specimens that tested positive for flu between Dec. 13 and Dec. 20, 2,029 of them had influenza A. When 1,627 of those specimens were subtyped, 1,493, or nearly 92%, were found to be H3N2.",
      "Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution, told CBS News that the virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize the illness. The strain is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors.",
      "Fewer people have also gotten\u00a0flu shots\u00a0this year. About 130 million doses of the flu vaccine have been administered nationwide, the CDC said.",
      "Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that while experts are expecting a \"H3N2 mismatch,\" the vaccine's \"match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good.\" Meanwhile, early season data from the United Kingdom suggests that the vaccines are still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children.",
      "\"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do,\" Bloom said. \"It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk.\"",

      "Gold futures have also soared this year, with the precious metal hitting record highs earlier in December.",
      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",
      "\"Silver saw a record rally in 2025. The 150% increase is significantly higher than that of gold and other assets in the sector,\" noted Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, in an email.",
      "Despite silver's price gains this year, the metal is still far from its inflation-adjusted price record, which was set in 1980, he noted. \u00a0\"To return to that level, silver would have to cost $200 per ounce today,\" he noted.",
      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",
      "The CME raised margin requirements for the contracts in a notice posted Friday. Such moves are designed to protect the exchange by reducing the risk that traders cannot cover their bets if prices swing sharply.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some artists have announced cancellations of their upcoming performances at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts, following the addition of President Trump's name to the building. Richard Grenell, president of the Kennedy Center, referred to the artists who canceled their shows as \"far left political activists\" who \"were booked by the previous far-left leadership.\"",
      "The Kennedy Center board, whose members were selected by Mr. Trump, voted earlier this month to add his name to the building. An official name change\u00a0appears to require approval by Congress. The president and his allies assumed control of the board earlier this year, sparking the decision by some artists not to perform at the institution. In March, Lin-Manuel Miranda canceled a production of \"Hamilton\" that was supposed to be part of the events planned around the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Recently, more artists announced cancellations, including the jazz ensemble The Cookers, scheduled to perform on New Year's Eve.",
      "\"Jazz was born from struggle and from a relentless insistence on freedom: freedom of thought, of expression, and of the full human voice,\" The Cookers said in a statement on their website, although they didn't cite a specific reason for their cancellation. \"Some of us have been making this music for many decades, and that history still shapes us. We are not turning away from our audience, and do want to make sure that when we do return to the bandstand, the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it.\"",
      "Some artists who announced cancellations were more blunt.",
      "The New York City-based Doug Varone and Dancers company cited the renaming of the building as the catalyst for their decision to pull out of April shows.",
      "\"While we totally disagreed with the takeover by the Trump Administration at the Kennedy Center, we still believed it was important to honor our engagement out of respect for both Jane Raleigh and Alicia Adams, who curated a first-rate dance season, as well as for the dance audiences in DC,\" the dance company wrote. \"However, with the latest act of Donald J. Trump renaming the Center after himself, we can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"",
      "A post shared by Doug Varone and Dancers (@dovadance)",
      "American Folk singer Kristy Lee posted on Instagram last week to announce the cancelation of her concert scheduled for Jan. 14, citing the decision to \"rebrand\" American history.",
      "\"I won't lie to you, canceling shows hurts,\" Lee wrote. \"This is how I keep the lights on. But losing my integrity would cost me more than any paycheck. When American history starts getting treated like something you can ban, erase, rename, or rebrand for somebody else's ego, I can't stand on that stage and sleep right at night. America didn't get built by branding. It got built by people showing up and doing the work. And the folks who carry it don't need their name on it, they just show up.\"",
      "Grenell responded to the cancellations in a post on X.",
      "\"The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership,\" he wrote on X. \"Their actions prove that the previous team was more concerned about booking far left political activists rather than artists willing to perform for everyone regardless of their political beliefs.  Boycotting the Arts to show you support the Arts is a form of derangement syndrome.  The arts are for everyone and the left is mad about it.\"",
      "When Kennedy Center leadership was revamped earlier this year, the president was trying to move away from what he views as \"woke culture.\"",

      "Quarterback Drew Brees and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald headlined a group of four modern era finalists in their first year of eligibility for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.",
      "Tight end Jason Witten and running back Frank Gore were the two other first-year eligible players who were also announced Tuesday among the 15 finalists.",
      "Willie Anderson, Torry Holt, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri were guaranteed spots after advancing to the final seven in voting for the 2025 class. There are six other returning finalists with Eli Manning, Reggie Wayne, Jahri Evans, Marshall Yanda, Terrell Suggs and Darren Woodson all making it back to this stage.",
      "Defensive tackle Kevin Williams made it to the finalist stage for the first time in his sixth year of eligibility.",
      "The 50-person selection committee will vote on the 15 finalists next month with the results announced Feb. 5 at \"NFL Honors.\" Between three and five of the finalists will be inducted in the second year of this current format.",
      "In addition to the modern era finalists, the selection committee will also consider seniors candidates Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood, coaching candidate Bill Belichick and contributor Robert Kraft. Between one and three of those finalists will make it into the Hall.",
      "Only four people got in last year for the smallest class in 20 years.",
      "Brees and Fitzgerald are the top new candidates this year.",
      "Brees is second all time to Tom Brady with 80,358 yards passing and 571 touchdown passes. He spent the first five seasons of his career with the San Diego Chargers before signing as a free agent with the Saints in 2006, where his career took off as he helped lift a city still recovering from Hurricane Katrina.",
      "Brees delivered to New Orleans its first Super Bowl title following the 2009 season, when he won MVP of the game after beating Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts. Brees made the Pro Bowl 13 times in his career, won AP Offensive Player of the Year in 2008 and 2011, was an All-Pro in 2006 and was a second-team All-Pro four times.",
      "Fitzgerald spent his entire career with the Arizona Cardinals after being drafted third overall in 2004. His 1,432 catches and 17,492 yards receiving in 17 seasons rank second all time to Jerry Rice.",
      "Fitzgerald topped 1,000 yards receiving nine times \u2014 tied for the fourth most ever \u2014 and helped the Cardinals reach their only Super Bowl following the 2008 season. Fitzgerald set single-season records that postseason with 546 yards receiving and seven TD catches, including a go-ahead 64-yard score with 2:37 to play in the Super Bowl before Pittsburgh rallied for a 27-23 win over Arizona.",
      "Witten was one of the most prolific tight ends with his 1,228 catches and 13,046 yards ranking second best all time. Witten was a two-time All-Pro for Dallas and was a second-team All-Pro two other times.",
      "Gore ranks third all time with 16,000 yards rushing with nine 1,000-yard seasons and five Pro Bowl honors.",
      "Kuechly's career was brief but impactful. The first-round pick by Carolina in 2012 was an All-Pro five times, with seven Pro Bowl nods and a Defensive Rookie of the Year award.",
      "Over his eight-year career, Kuechly led all linebackers in the NFL in tackles (1,090), takeaways (26), interceptions (18) and passes defensed (66).",
      "Vinatieri was one of the most clutch kickers in NFL history, making the game-winning field goals in the first two Super Bowl victories during New England's dynasty.",
      "He helped launch the run with one of the game's greatest kicks \u2014 a 45-yarder in the snow to force overtime in the \"Tuck Rule\" game against the Raiders in the 2001 divisional round. He made the game-winning kick in OT to win that game and then hit a 48-yarder on the final play of a 20-17 win in the Super Bowl against the Rams.",
      "Vinatieri is the NFL's career leader in points (2,673) and made field goals (599) over a 24-year career with New England and Indianapolis. He also leads all players with 56 field goals and 238 points in the postseason.",
      "Holt was a key part of the Rams' \"Greatest Show on Turf,\" helping the team win the Super Bowl in his rookie season in 1999 and getting back there two years later. Holt led the NFL in yards receiving in 2000 and in catches and yards in 2003 when he made his only All-Pro team.",
      "Holt finished his career with 920 catches for 13,382 yards and 74 TDs.",
      "Anderson was considered one of the top right tackles in his era after being a first-round pick by Cincinnati in 1996. He spent nearly his entire career with the Bengals and made three straight All-Pro teams from 2004-06.",
      "Among the candidates who didn't advance from the 26 semifinalists were quarterback Philip Rivers, who was taken off the ballot when he came out of retirement, and offensive lineman Steve Wisniewski, who was in his final year of eligibility as a modern era candidate.",

    "summary": "The bad news from the past year (and there was a lot of it) drowned out much of the GOOD news that made smaller headlines. David Pogue reports on some of 2025's best underreported stories.",
    "story": [
      "Good morning! And this is \u2026 the good news of the year!",
      "Yeah, I know, I know. I've heard the jokes. \"The good news in 2025? This is gonna be a really short broadcast!\" But that's only because the good news got drowned out by all the bad news.",
      "We begin today with \u2026 plastics!",
      "Compostable plastics",
      "Plastic is made of petroleum. And when we throw it away, it breaks down into tiny particles that wind up in our bodies, our blood, and our brains.",
      "So, where's the good news? Material that may look like ordinary plastic, but this stuff is made from sugar cane, and it's completely biodegradable. \"It's compostable plastic,\" said Andrew Brousseau, who runs Black Earth Compost near Boston. \"The key is that they break down, and they don't leave microplastics in our soils.\"",
      "At Black Earth Compost, these better plastics break down along with household food scraps to become valuable compost for farms and gardens.",
      "The finished product? Compost \u2013 \"Black gold\" \u2013 that's safe, with no microplastics in our brain.",
      "Max Senechal is an executive at CJ Biomaterials in Woburn, Mass., one of several companies now making completely compostable plastics.",
      "\"The good news now in '25 is that we've reached a point where we can produce these at large scale,\" Senechal said.",
      "Take for example a biodegradable plastic straw. Senechal said it \"gives you all the functionality without the guilt!\"",
      "Disagreement",
      "If we can all agree on anything, it's that we can't agree on anything.",
      "\"We certainly have gotten to a place where disagreement is mostly just corrosive,\" said Northwestern University professor Eli Finkel. \"We need to find a way to do it better.\"",
      "Finkel may have found it. He co-created the Litowitz Center for Enlightened Disagreement at Northwestern University, one of several new projects to help us disagree better, such as running exercises that teach students how to disagree.",
      "\"In fact, the first program involved the use of improv techniques,\" Finkel said. \"For example, imagine that your job is to rant for one full minute about something that makes you very, very angry. My job is to take that information and present to everybody what it is that you value \u2013 not why you're angry, not what you are opposed to, but what is underneath the anger that you feel.\"",
      "Does it work? \"I feel very hopeful,\" said Finkel. \"The students are really leaning in to this idea that, to be a productive member of a multicultural society, we need to be able at least to listen and understand what the people who disagree with us believe.\"",
      "He said the goal is to apply this dynamic to the demographic at large: \"If we can achieve here what it looks like we're achieving, I think it won't take us long before we're able to spread this not only to other institutions of higher education, but to high schools and perhaps even beyond,\" Finkel said.",
      "Popup Wetlands",
      "Everyone knows that birds fly South for the winter, and back again in the spring. But these are not nonstop flights; they need places along their long journeys to stop, eat, and sleep.",
      "According to The Nature Conservancy's Katie Riley, California has lost at least 90% of the lakes and marshes that were once layover spots, thanks to urban growth, modern agriculture, and climate change. Her team's radical idea: Pay farmers to flood their fallow fields during migration times, creating \"pop-up\" wetlands.",
      "Riley said, \"Some birds, like the sandhill cranes we're seeing out here today, use those flooded fields actually to sleep. Much smaller birds, they need flooded fields to be able to feed and access little bugs in the field.\"",
      "I asked, \"If you weren't paying farmers to flood their fields here, what would happen to those birds that are trying to migrate?\"",
      "\"They would not survive,\" Riley replied. \"We would see populations go down.\"",
      "This year, the farmers in the BirdReturns program are offering about 50,000 acres of bird rest stops.",
      "Ben Leacox, general manager of Zuckerman Family Farms in Lodi, Calif., said not only do birds benefit from it, but farmers do, too: \"This program may be the difference between me being in the black or the red this year,\" he said. \"This is a win-win transaction for everybody.\"",
      "AI and Med",
      "You might not expect to find artificial intelligence on a \"good-news\" show. [\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f] But in healthcare, AI is bringing enormous advances in predicting disease, discovering new drugs and, especially, diagnosing illnesses.",
      "\"It's pretty darned good,\" said Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. He's also author of an upcoming book about artificial intelligence in medicine: \"A Giant Leap: How AI Is Transforming Healthcare and What That Means for Our Future.\"",
      "He gave us a demonstration, by providing a patient's symptoms to ChatGPT: \"I have a 28-year-old patient, she's lost a bunch of weight in the last six weeks. She's kind of tremulous, she's shaking. She's pretty sweaty, and her stools are loose. Can you gimme a sense of what might be going on?\"",
      "ChatGPT replied: \"Based on those symptoms, it sounds like she could be dealing with something like hyperthyroidism. Of course, you'd want to confirm that with some thyroid function tests.\"",
      "But we know that AI sometimes can make stuff up \u2013 what's known as \"AI hallucinations.\" Isn't that a risk? \"It can be, and it's something we worry about,\" Wachter said. \"And it's why, at least for now, you don't want this thing diagnosing by itself. We talk about the doctor in the loop.",
      "\"It's getting better every year, and I think this was the year that we turned a corner, where this is going to be something of a golden era in medicine over the next five or ten years,\" he said.",
      "Wrap",
      "Well, I'm afraid that's all the time we have. We won't have time to mention how U.S. homicides dropped almost 20 percent this year \u2026",
      "Or how Paris cleaned up the Seine River so completely that people are now swimming in it for the first time in 100 years \u2026",
      "Or how a British charity cleared 300,000 land mines left over from a civil war in Sri Lanka, foot by foot. It took 16 years, but now 280,000 people have returned safely home \u2026",
      "Or how four old dams on the Klamath River in California and Oregon had cut off salmon from their traditional spawning grounds for over 100 years \u2013 but once the old dams were removed last year, the salmon returned within days. Somehow, they remembered!",
      "Have a joyous New Year, and remember: Bad news breaks suddenly, but good news happens everywhere, all the time. Good morning, everyone!",

      "NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin's father died from injuries he suffered in a house fire Sunday in North Carolina, officials said. Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 winner, has always credited his father's sacrifices and support for his success on the track.",
      "The father, Dennis Hamlin, was 75. Denny Hamlin's mother, 69-year-old Mary Lou Hamlin, was critically injured in the blaze at the couple's home in Gaston County and is currently hospitalized. The fire is under investigation.",
      "Firefighters arrived at the two-story house Sunday night to find it mostly engulfed by the fire, and the structure ultimately collapsed, The Associated Press reported. The house is located in the town of Stanley, about 20 miles northwest of Charlotte.",
      "Firefighters found Hamlin's parents outside after they narrowly escaped the flames and both were rushed to the hospital. Mary Lou Hamlin was taken to Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Burn Center in Winston-Salem, where officials said she was in critical condition. Dennis Hamlin did not survive his injuries.",
      "The tragedy for Denny Hamlin, 45, comes after the NASCAR champion won his 60th race in October \u2014 a victory he dedicated to his father, whose health had been on the decline for some time. It was a milestone that Hamlin said he could not have achieved without his father's sacrifices.",
      "\"He's the one who got me into racing, took me to the track when I was five, sold everything they had, you know, we almost lost our house a couple times, and just tried to keep it all going,\" Hamlin said at the October race, adding: \"I'm just glad he was able to see 60.\"",
      "Hamlin also spoke about his father's health in October, telling AP that his dad was battling a serious illness and did not have a lot of time left.",
      "\"I know for a fact this is my last chance for my dad to see it. I don't want him going and never getting to see the moment,\" Hamlin said.",

      "Homeland Security agents were in Minneapolis on Monday \"conducting a massive investigation on child care and other rampant fraud,\" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said.",
      "Two DHS officials told CBS News that agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations branch were expected to inspect over 30 sites in the city on Monday alone.",
      "Noem and DHS posted videos of HSI agents inspecting several sites, including one that appears to be a smoke shop.",
      "Many of their targets came not from tips from the FBI, but from a video posted on social media over the weekend. The viral video, posted by conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley, alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any service.",
      "HSI has historically investigated criminal activity with an international or immigration nexus, such as child exploitation, drug smuggling, identity theft and fraud. Under the second Trump administration, many HSI agents have been assigned to work alongside ICE's immigration enforcement branch to find and arrest immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Asked whether the effort in Minneapolis is focused on the suspected fraud there or immigration enforcement, a senior DHS official said, a \"little of everything.\"",
      "The HSI investigation comes a day after FBI Director Kash Patel called previous fraud arrests in Minnesota \"just the tip of a very large iceberg.\" He said that the agency has \"surged personnel and investigative resources\" to the state to investigate fraud.",
      "Earlier this month, federal prosecutors said the total fraud in Minnesota's Medicaid programs could be as much as $9 billion, a figure that Gov. Tim Walz and other state officials have disputed.",
      "The accusations from federal prosecutors prompted a group of Minnesota House and Senate Republicans on Monday to call on Walz to resign. In response, the governor's office said Walz has been working for years to crack down on fraud and has asked the state Legislature for more authority to take aggressive action.",
      "This summer, Walz\u00a0agreed with a previous estimate from First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson\u00a0that fraud across all programs, including the\u00a0Feeding Our Future scheme, which is not a DHS-administered program, could total $1 billion.",

    "story": [
      "A Utah judge on Monday ordered the release of a transcript from a closed-door hearing in October over whether the man charged with killing Charlie Kirk must be shackled during court proceedings.",
      "State District Judge Tony Graf said public transparency was \"foundational\" to the judicial system before ordering the release of details from the Oct. 24 closed hearing. Attorneys for media outlets, including The Associated Press, had argued for access because they said it was also the first time defense attorneys suggested a ban on cameras in the courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder in the Sept. 10 shooting of the conservative activist on the Utah Valley University campus in Orem. They plan to seek the death penalty. Robinson has not yet entered a plea.",
      "In a 97-page transcript released later Monday, attorneys for Robinson argued that widespread videos and photos of him shackled and in jail clothing could create bias against him among potential jurors. Defense attorney Richard Novak said prohibiting cameras would be \"very easy\" for the court to enforce and could help curb visual prejudice.",
      "\"We're not litigating this case in the press,\" Novak said during the Oct. 24 hearing.",
      "The transcript contained limited redactions to remove discussions of security protocols in the closely watched case. Graf also ordered the release of an audio recording of the hearing, again with redactions.",
      "Robinson was not present in court Monday and appeared via audio feed from the Utah County Jail.",
      "Graf has not ruled on the defense's suggestion to ban cameras, but he has implemented other limitations.",
      "Days after the closed-door hearing, Graf ruled that Robinson could wear civilian clothes in pretrial hearings but must also wear restraints to ensure the safety of court staff and Robinson himself. Utah court rules require defendants who are in custody to be restrained or supervised at all times unless otherwise ordered.",
      "Graf also prohibited media outlets from publishing photos, videos and live broadcasts that show Robinson's restraints to help protect his presumption of innocence before a trial.",
      "The judge briefly stopped a media livestream of a hearing earlier this month and ordered the camera be moved after Robinson's attorneys said the stream showed the defendant's shackles. Graf said he would terminate future broadcasts if there were further violations.",
      "Lawyers for the media wrote in recent filings that an open court \"safeguards the integrity of the fact-finding process\" while fostering public confidence in judicial proceedings. Criminal cases in the U.S. have long been open to the public, which the attorneys argued is proof that trials can be conducted fairly without restricting reporters.",
      "In a separate ruling Monday, Graf denied a request from attorneys for the media who sought to intervene in the case. The judge said members of the press do not need to be formal parties in the proceedings to access court records.",
      "Still, Graf said the involved publications must be notified of future requests to close hearings or restrict access to court filings.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to lay out their case against Robinson at a preliminary hearing scheduled to begin May 18.",

      "Just after 9:30 p.m. on Christmas, Southfield Police were called to the Riverstone Apartments on Shiawassee Road for reports of a shooting. Investigators said that, earlier that day, a 23-year-old woman and her 30-year-old boyfriend got into an argument.",
      "\"They began arguing over damaged property and allegations of infidelity, where she believed that he had been unfaithful,\" Barren said. \"The female victim told officers that she was slapped, strangled and kicked multiple times during the assault.\"",
      "Instead of calling 911, the woman called her friend to help gather her boyfriend's belongings.",
      "\"The victim stated that she did not contact law enforcement due to the relationship she had with the suspect's 3-year-old child, and she didn't want the suspects arrested, which would prevent him from being with his child,\" Barren said.",
      "That friend brought her 20-year-old boyfriend from Madison Heights, who was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun.",
      "They say the 30-year-old returned later that night, and when they wouldn't let him inside, he kicked down the door. After another brief altercation between the couple, the 30-year-old gained possession of his AR-15 rifle.",
      "\"Both men immediately began shooting at each other,\" Barren said. \"Guns will get you in more trouble than they will ever get you out of.\"",
      "The friend took her boyfriend to the hospital, where he later died.",
      "Meanwhile, the 23-year-old victim hid in a bedroom, but she could hear her boyfriend, who had been shot eight times, pleading for help.",
      "\"She exited the nearby bedroom and walked towards the living room to check on him. She observed him hunched over the couch. She observed the assault rifle next to him. He made eye contact with her and shot three rounds at her,\" Barren said.",
      "She walked away with only a gunshot wound to her thumb. Her boyfriend eventually succumbed to his injuries. The 3-year-old boy was in the apartment at the time. He wasn't hurt and has since been reunited with his biological mother.",

      "Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez, the Spanish woman whose botched restoration of a century-old painting of Jesus Christ captured global headlines more than a decade ago, has died. She was 94.",
      "Officials in Borja, northeastern Spain, confirmed Gim\u00e9nez's death on Facebook. Mayor Eduardo Arilla told a local newspaper she died in a nursing home, The New York Times reported.",
      "The foundation that manages the church in Borja where the \"Ecce Homo\" fresco is displayed\u00a0said she was a great lover of painting from a young age. The foundation called her \"one of the most famous figures of 2012\" and noted that she had, \"with the best intentions, decided to repaint\" the fresco at the Sanctuary of Mercy Church because of its poor condition.",
      "Gim\u00e9nez's attempt left Christ's face cartoonish and unrecognizable, sparking a flood of online reactions, memes, and parodies featuring famous figures such as Michael Jackson and Homer Simpson.",
      "Her restoration added what appeared to be a mane to the figure of Christ, leading the small painting by local artist Elias Garcia Martinez, created in the 1910s, to be nicknamed the \"Monkey Christ.\"",
      "At the time, Gim\u00e9nez acknowledged the damage, but she told a state-run broadcaster that the parish priest authorized the restoration.",
      "\"The priest knew! He did! How could we do something like that without permission? He knew,\" Gim\u00e9nez said. \"Everybody who came into the church could see me as I was painting. I didn't do anything secretly.\"",
      "The controversy quickly turned Borja into a tourist destination, with about 57,000 visitors coming to see the previously little-known church the following year.",
      "When the controversy subsided, supporters helped Gim\u00e9nez put on an art exhibition featuring 28 of her own paintings, CBS News partner BBC News\u00a0reported.",

      "No one was seriously injured following the incident on the Macugnaga cable car, which travels up to the Moro Pass at an altitude of 2,800 meters (9,000 feet) near the Swiss border, a spokesman for the Alpine rescue services told the Agence France-Press news agency.",

      "The crash happened at about 11:30 a.m. local time. Authorities said it took about three hours for all of those stranded to be evacuated by helicopter.",
      "Filippo Besozzi, administrator of the company that manages the cable car, told the ANSA news agency that the most seriously injured was a 59-year-old man who hurt his arm.",

      "Sydney residents Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram spent most of November in Davao City in the southern Philippines, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "They returned on a flight from Manila on Nov. 29. Two weeks later, they are accused of killing 15 and wounding another 40 in a mass shooting that targeted a Hannukah festival at Bondi Beach.",

Jojo, who works at at the GV Hotel, said the father and son checked in on Nov. 1 and left on Nov. 28. He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",

      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Barrett said she was limited in what she could disclose about the investigation in the Philippines because she did not want to prejudice Naveed Akram's trial.",
      "He has yet to enter pleas to dozens of charges including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. Police shot him in the abdomen during a gunfight at Bondi on Dec. 14 and he spent a week in a hospital before he was transferred to a prison. Police shot his father dead at Bondi.",
      "Authorities are promising the largest police presence ever at New Year's Eve festivities at Sydney Harbor on Wednesday. More than 2,500 officers will be on duty. Many will be openly carrying automatic rifles, a sight rarely seen on Sydney streets.",
      "The first police responders to the Bondi massacre were armed with Glock pistols that lacked the lethal range of the Akrams' rifles and shotguns. Two police officers were among the wounded.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the state was not moving toward a more militarized police force in response to the attack.",
      "\"Given we've just had the worst terrorism event in Australia's history inside the last month, it would be self-evidently the case that things need to change and the security needs to change,\" Minns said.",
      "\"I understand that there'll be some people that oppose this or regard it as the militarization of the police. My sense is far more families would fully support that kind of police operation because they will feel far safer in that environment,\" Minns added.",
      "More than 1 million revelers crowd the waterfront each year to see a world-famous fireworks display centered on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.",

      "Berlin \u2014 Robbers used a large drill to break into a German savings bank's vault room and steal cash, gold and jewelry worth some 30 million euros ($35 million), police said Tuesday.",
      "The heist in the western city of Gelsenkirchen saw the thieves break into more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes, they said.",
      "While the criminals remained at large, hundreds of distressed bank customers massed outside the branch on Tuesday demanding information, but were kept at bay by police.",
      "According to police, the robbers drilled their way into the underground vault room of the Sparkasse savings bank from a parking garage.",
      "Investigators suspect the gang spent much of the weekend inside, breaking open the deposit boxes.",
      "The break-in came to light after a fire alarm was triggered in the early hours of Monday and emergency services discovered the hole.",

      "Footage from security cameras has also shown a black Audi RS 6 leaving the parking garage early Monday morning, with masked persons inside.",
      "The car's license plate had been stolen earlier in the city of Hanover, police said.",

The four suspected thieves have been arrested, but none of the state treasures have been recovered.",
      "Several victims of the robbery in Germany had told police officers that their losses far exceeded the insured value of their safe deposit boxes.",

    "summary": "After meeting with Israel's Netanyahu, Trump said he'd heard Iran is trying to rebuild its nuclear program, \"and if they are, we're going to have to knock them down.\"",
    "story": [
      "Tehran, Iran\u00a0\u2014 Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian promised on Tuesday a harsh response to any attack, appearing to respond to a warning the previous day by President Trump over Iran's purported attempts to rebuild its nuclear program.",
      "\"Answer of Islamic Republic of Iran to any cruel aggression will be harsh and discouraging,\" Pezeshkian said in a social media post.",
      "Pezeshkian did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Mr. Trump suggested the U.S. could carry out new military strikes if Iran attempts to reconstitute its nuclear program.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment during wide-ranging talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the U.S. leader's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.",
      "\"Now I hear that Iran is trying to build up again,\" Mr. Trump said during a news conference with Netanyahu after their meeting. \"And if they are, we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"",
      "The two leaders discussed the possibility of renewed military action against Tehran months after a 12-day air war in June that killed nearly 1,100 Iranians, including senior military commanders and scientists. Iran's retaliatory missile barrage killed 28 people in Israel.",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" of Iran's nuclear program after three sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. in June, but questions were raised\u00a0about the extent of the damage inflicted. An\u00a0initial classified assessment\u00a0determined that the strikes had set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said it was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers, after a classified briefing on the strikes, argued that Mr. Trump had misled the American people about the level of success achieved.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested Monday that he could order another U.S. strike against Iran if he believes it's needed.",
      "\"If it's confirmed, they know the consequences, and the consequences will be very powerful, maybe more powerful than the last time,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he had heard Iran was rebuilding its capabilities after his closed-door meeting on Monday with Netanyahu, who has pressed successive U.S. administrations for decades to take a harder line against Iran.",
      "\"Netanyahu remains focused on reducing threats from Iran to Israel, which he has been for the almost 30 years he's been in office,\" CBS News national security contributor Samantha Vinograd, a former top Homeland Security official in the Obama administration, said Tuesday.",
      "But Vinograd added that \"the United States and Israel may have different intelligence assessments of what Iran's intentions are, what their capabilities are.\"",
      "She said the U.S. strikes over the summer \u2014 known as Operation Midnight Hammer \u2014 \"did inflict damage to Iran's nuclear facilities, however Iran does retain highly enriched uranium which could be used to breakout to a bomb.\"",
      "Vinograd said, however, the most immediate threat posed by Iran \u2014 not only to Israel but to U.S. forces in the region \u2014   may well be its massive stockpile of conventional ballistic missiles, not its potential to try to build a viable nuclear weapon.",
      "\"Iran has had more ballistic missiles than any other nation in the region, other than Israel, and it's really their leverage when it comes to wreaking havoc across the region, both against targets in Israel, American troops overseas, via proxies and more.\"",
      "\"It does appear that there is some kind of intelligence gap between what the U.S. thinks Iran is doing and capable of, and what Israeli intelligence is saying on those fronts.\"",
      "Pezeshkian said Saturday that tension between the two sides had already risen again, claiming: \"We are in a full-scale war with the U.S., Israel and Europe; they don't want our country to remain stable.\"",
      "Iran has insisted it is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program.",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies and the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency assessed Iran last had an organized nuclear weapons program in 2003, though Tehran had continued enriching uranium up to 60%, which is a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:53:52 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S.-British firm Ocean Infinity intends to scour almost 6,000 square miles of seafloor for the missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777.",
    "story": [
      "Almost 12 years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished over the Indian Ocean with 239 people on board, the search for the Boeing 777's wreckage was scheduled to resume Tuesday in the Indian Ocean \u2014 supported by the latest advancements in deep-sea, self-guided drone technology.",
      "MH370 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur shortly after midnight on March 8, 2014. It should have been a routine, roughly six-hour flight north to Beijing.",
      "About 40 minutes later, the aircraft's transponder switched off, which made it disappear from civilian air traffic control monitors. Military radar, however, picked up the plane banking sharply west, back over the Malay Peninsula and out over the third largest body of water in the world, the vast Indian Ocean.",
      "The initial search for the aircraft covered more than 46,000 square miles off the coast of western Australia, an area larger than the state of Virginia. But using drift analysis, incorporating data on the history of ocean currents and winds, the people in charge of the search have now narrowed down the area of highest probability for success to around 5,800 square miles.",
      "British-American deep sea robotics company Ocean Infinity has not revealed the location of the new search, but it hopes to finally solve the tragic mystery by deploying a fleet of the world's most advanced underwater drones.",
      "The drones, or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), are capable of diving nearly 20,000 feet and running for up to 100 hours before they need to resurface. They're equipped with side-scan sonar to create detailed 3D images of the seafloor \u2014 and anything on it \u2014   as they cruise near the bottom, following the contour up and down mountains and into trenches hidden in the abyss.",
      "The AUVs can also use ultrasound imaging to peer beneath seafloor sediment that's built up over the years, as well as magnetometers that could detect metals in the wreckage of the lost aircraft.",
      "If an object of interest is detected, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) would then be deployed to take a closer look.",
      "To date, fewer than 30 fragments believed to be from MH370 have washed up on different shores across the Indian Ocean.",
      "The first was found in 2015, on the French island of La R\u00e9union, more than 400 miles off the eastern coast of Madagascar. A beach cleaner found a flaperon that would have helped the plane roll to the left or right during flight.",
      "Through 2016, more fragments were found washed ashore on Madagascar itself, as well as in Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Mauritius, including a door that covered the front landing gear, a flap from the right wing, and a panel from where a wing joined onto the aircraft's fuselage \u2014 what should have been one of the aircraft's strongest joints.",
      "So far, no remains of the aircraft's crew or passengers \u2014   who came from 14 countries including China, Australia, France, the United States, Ukraine and Russia \u2014   have been found.",
      "Malaysia's government agreed to pay Ocean Infinity $70 million, but it has been labelled a \"no-find, no fee\" contract, meaning the company only gets paid if it finds the missing plane.",
      "Given the huge amount of money invested in the search effort, $70 million wouldn't actually be a massive payout, but Ocean Infinity would also be able to boast solving one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries since American aviator Amelia Earhart vanished in 1937 somewhere over the central Pacific Ocean.",

    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

    "summary": "The removal by a U.S. military cemetery in the Netherlands of two displays recognizing Black troops who fought in World War II has spurred anger there.",
    "story": [
      "Margraten, Netherlands \u2014 Ever since a U.S. military cemetery in the southern Netherlands removed two displays recognizing Black troops who helped liberate Europe from the Nazis, visitors have filled the guestbook with objections.",
      "Sometime in the spring, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the U.S. government agency responsible for maintaining memorial sites outside the United States, removed the panels from the visitors center at the American Cemetery in Margraten, the final resting place for roughly 8,300 U.S. soldiers, set in rolling hills near the border with Belgium and Germany.",
      "The move came after President Trump issued a series of executive orders ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs. \"Our country will be woke no longer,\" he said in an address to Congress in March.",
      "The removal, carried out without public explanation, has angered Dutch officials, the families of U.S. soldiers and the local residents who honor the American sacrifice by caring for the graves.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands Joe Popolo seemed to support the removal of the displays. \"The signs at Margraten are not intended to promote an agenda that criticizes America,\" he wrote on social media following a visit to the cemetery after the controversy had erupted. Popolo declined a request for comment.",
      "One display told the story of 23-year-old George H. Pruitt, a Black soldier buried at the cemetery, who died attempting to rescue a comrade from drowning in 1945. The other described the U.S. policy of racial segregation in place during World War II.",
      "Some 1 million Black soldiers enlisted in the U.S. military during the war, serving in separate units, mostly doing menial tasks but also fighting in some combat missions. An all-Black unit dug the thousands of graves in Margraten during the brutal 1944-45 season of famine in the German-occupied Netherlands known in the Hunger Winter.",
      "Cor Linssen, the 79-year-old son of a Black American soldier and a Dutch mother, is one of those who opposes the removal of the panels.",
      "Linssen grew up some 30 miles (50 kilometers) away from the cemetery and although he didn't learn who his father was until later in life, he knew he was the son of a Black soldier.",
      "\"When I was born, the nurse thought something was wrong with me because I was the wrong color,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I was the only dark child at school.\"",
      "Linssen together with a group of other children of Black soldiers, now all in their 70s and 80s, visited the cemetery in February 2025 to see the panels.",
      "\"It's an important part of history,\" Linssen said. \"They should put the panels back.\"",
      "After months of mystery around the disappearance of the panels, two media organizations - the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and online media Dutch News - this month published emails obtained through a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request showing that Trump's DEI policies directly prompted the commission to take down the panels.",
      "The White House did not respond to queries from AP about the removed panels.",
      "The American Battle Monuments Commission did not respond to queries from AP about the revelations. Earlier, the ABMC told the AP that the panel that discussed segregation \"did not fall within (the) commemorative mission.''",
      "It also said that the panel about Pruitt was \"rotated\" out. The replacement panel features Leslie Loveland, a white soldier killed in Germany in 1945, who is buried at Margraten.",
      "Chair of the Black Liberators foundation and Dutch senator Theo Bovens said his organization, which pushed for the inclusion of the panels at the visitors center, was not informed that they were removed. He told AP it is \"strange\" that the U.S. commission feels the panels are not in their mission, as they placed them in 2024.",
      "\"Something has changed in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Bovens, who is from the region around Margraten, is one of thousands of locals who tend to the graves at the cemetery. People who adopt a grave visit it regularly and leave flowers on the fallen soldier's birthday and other holidays. The responsibility is often passed down through Dutch families, and there is a waiting list to adopt graves of the U.S. soldiers.",
      "Both the city and the province where the cemetery is located have demanded the panels be returned. In November, a Dutch television program recreated the panels and installed them outside the cemetery, where they were quickly removed by police. The show is now seeking a permanent location for them.",
      "The Black Liberators is also looking to find a permanent location for a memorial for the Black soldiers who gave their lives to free the Dutch.",
      "On America Square, in front of the Eijsden-Margraten city hall, there is a small park named for Jefferson Wiggins, a Black solider who, at age 19, dug many of the graves at Margraten when he was stationed in the Netherlands.",
      "In his memoir, published posthumously in 2014, he describes burying the bodies of his white comrades who he was barred from fraternizing with while they were alive.",
      "When Black soldiers came to Europe in the Second World War, ''what they found was people who accepted them, who welcomed them, who treated them as the heroes that they were.

      "President Trump said Monday that the U.S. wasn't given advance notice about the Chinese exercises, but he was not particularly concerned about them, either. He brushed aside the possibility of counterpart Xi Jinping ordering an invasion of Taiwan, noting that China has conducted exercises around the island for many years.",

      "Taiwan said the zones, some of which are within 12 nautical miles of its coast, had affected international shipping and aviation routes.",
      "Dozens of flights to Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands were cancelled, according to the island's Civil Aviation Administration, affecting around 6,000 passengers, while more than 850 scheduled international flights will be \"affected\" and could face delays.",

      "Standing alongside Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Mr. Trump also claimed dozens of other countries that supported the peace deal are ready to \"wipe out\" the terrorist group if Hamas doesn't disarm, but he did not name any of them.",
      "The president said of Hamas, \"They're going to be given a very short period of time to disarm.\" Standing alongside Netanyahu, Mr. Trump added, \"And we'll see how that works out. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be in charge of that, from our side. But if they don't disarm, as they agreed to do \u2014 they agreed to it \u2014 then there will be hell to pay for them. And we don't want that. We're not looking for that. But they have to disarm within a fairly short period of time.\"",
      "\"We have 59 countries that signed on, big countries, countries that are outside of the Middle East as you know the Middle East,\" the president added. \"They want to go in and wipe out Hamas. They don't want Israel, they don't need Israel; they want to do it because it's the right thing to do. Because they were for the deal, based on the fact that Hamas pledged, they swore, that they were going to disarm. Now, if they're not going to disarm, those same countries will wipe out Hamas.\"",

Hamas has refused to disarm and has not yet returned all Israeli hostage remains, while Israel has recently conducted some strikes in Gaza. The family of Israeli Sgt. Maj. Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose remains have not yet been returned, was at Mar-a-Lago Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also said ahead of the meeting that he would support an Israeli attack on Iran, should Iran begin again to build up its ballistic missile and nuclear programs. The president praised Netanyahu, telling reporters \"he's a wartime prime minister who's a hero.\" And the president said he has spoken with Israeli President Isaac Herzog about a pardon for Netanyahu, who is facing bribery and fraud charges.",
      "\"How do you not give a pardon, you know?\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think it's a very hard thing not to do it. ... He tells me it's on its way.\"",
      "Herzog's office, however, said in a statement, \"There has not been a conversation between President Herzog and President Trump since the pardon request was submitted.\" The statement also said that Herzog spoke several weeks ago with a representative of Mr. Trump who had \"inquired about the U.S. President's letter\" and who was told \"any decision on the matter will be made in accordance with the established procedures.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Netanyahu ahead of Mr. Trump's meeting. Netanyahu's visit comes a week after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, met with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss next steps in the peace plan.",
      "The Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect in November, more than two years after the war began with the attack by Hamas-led terrorists on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.",
      "This was the sixth meeting between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu since the president took office in January.",
      "Netanyahu's visit came on the heels of Mr. Trump's\u00a0meeting\u00a0Sunday at Mar-a-Lago with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the U.S. president continues to try to to broker a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. After that meeting, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy said they're nearly in agreement on a peace plan for Ukraine, and the Ukrainian leader praised what he called \"strong security guarantees\" from the U.S. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Mr. Trump spoke before and after his meeting with Zelenskyy, hasn't shown a willingness to compromise on his territorial demands. Russia attacked Kyiv shortly before Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.",

The president didn't offer the location of the facility, but he has repeatedly floated land strikes on alleged drug traffickers in Venezuela and other countries.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump was referring to a drug facility in Venezuela. CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of drug trafficking and working with gangs designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations, which Maduro denies.",
      "The U.S. has built up a heightened military presence in the region over the last few months, and Mr. Trump has also said he is instituting a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil vessels entering or exiting Venezuela, impacting a key economic sector for the South American country. The U.S. recently seized two\u00a0sanctioned oil tankers\u00a0off Venezuela's coast.",
      "The military began conducting boat strikes on Sept. 2, which the administration has justified by\u00a0arguing\u00a0the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with cartels.",
      "The strikes have drawn pushback from congressional Democrats and a handful of Republicans who argue the operations haven't been authorized by Congress and the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the vessels were carrying drugs. The Colombian and Venezuelan governments have also criticized the strikes.",

    "summary": "The U.S. announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as the Trump administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
    "story": [
      "Geneva \u2014 The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Trump's administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to \"adapt, shrink or die\" in a time of new financial realities.",
      "The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States' status as the world's largest humanitarian donor.",
      "\"This new model will better share the burden of U.N. humanitarian work with other developed countries and will require the U.N. to cut bloat, remove duplication, and commit to powerful new impact, accountability and oversight mechanisms,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media.",
      "The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services.",
      "The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.",
      "Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven millions toward hunger, displacement or disease, and harmed U.S. soft power around the world.",
      "The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.",
      "The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations \u2014 the world's top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money \u2014 takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official.",
      "Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden Sudan and Gaza, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change \u00a0have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.",
      "The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the International Organization for Migration, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration, or even during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Now, the idea is that Fletcher's office \u2014 which last year set in motion a \"humanitarian reset\" to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent \u2014 will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid.",
      "The United States wants to see \"more consolidated leadership authority\" in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.",
      "Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office \"are going to control the spigot\" on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.",
      "\"This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars \u2014 providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,\" said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.",
      "U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA's annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, already slashed the request this year. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year.",
      "\"The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.\"",
      "\"Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.'s most critical work,\" the department added. \"Today's agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump's commitment to remaining the world's most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.\"",
      "At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine.",
      "One of the world's most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Mr. Trump's as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan.",
      "The project, months in the making, stems from Mr. Trump's longtime view that the world body has great promise but has failed to live up to it and has, in his eyes, drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending.",
      "Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, \"At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.",

    "story": [
      "Russia's top diplomat said Monday, hours after President Trump touted progress toward a ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine, that Moscow's negotiating position would change following an alleged attempt by Ukraine to attack one of President Vladimir Putin's far-flung residences.",
      "Sergey Lavrov, a close Putin confidant and Russia's longtime foreign minister, said the Kremlin had already decided on retaliatory measures against Ukraine, which he did not elucidate.",
      "Lavrov accused Ukraine of launching dozens of drones to target Putin's residence in the Novgorod region, hundreds of miles from Moscow and near Russia's western borders with the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Lavrov said 91 Ukrainian drones were intercepted and there were no casualties and no damage caused.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy quickly issued a statement calling the Russian accusation \"lies\" and an effort to undermine the peace talks being spearheaded by the Trump administration.",
      "President Trump met with Zelenskyy Sunday at the American leader's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, after which Mr. Trump claimed again that Putin was committed to peace and that, \"Russia wants to see Ukraine succeed.\"",
      "That remark drew considerable attention, given that Putin and his aides have repeatedly\u00a0dismissed Ukraine's right to even exist as an independent nation.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt\u00a0said in a social media post that Mr. Trump held another \"positive call with President Putin concerning Ukraine\" on Monday, but she offered no further detail of the discussion, and it was unclear whether the presidents had spoken before or after Moscow accused Kyiv of targeting Putin's residence.",
      "Lavrov did not say how or when Russia would change its negotiating position in the talks to end the war, nearly four years since Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which his government still refers to only as a special military operation. But Putin himself said earlier on Monday, during a meeting with his military commander, that \"in the near future, it is necessary to continue the offensive.\"",
      "Putin even voiced optimism that Russian forces would be able to seize control of all four regions of eastern Ukraine that he declared dominion over about seven months into the full-scale invasion \u2014 Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas, along with Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Ukraine and its European partners have long warned that Putin's ongoing engagement with the Trump administration on Ukraine is really a play for time, as his military further expands its control over Ukrainian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy said after his Sunday talks with Mr. Trump that he believed the U.S. and Ukraine had reached about 90% agreement on a draft 20-point peace plan, but both men acknowledged there were lingering issues. These include Russia's unflinching demand that it be given sovereignty over the entire Donbas.",
      "Ukraine, along with its European partners, has consistently rejected the idea of rewarding Russia's unilateral assault with territorial concessions, noting that it could set a dangerous precedent unseen in Europe since the landgrab by Adolf Hitler at the beginning of what would become World War II.",
      "Despite Putin having shown no willingness to bend on his demand for an expansion of Russia's territory, Mr. Trump claimed Sunday that Ukraine and Russia were \"closer than ever before\" to a peace settlement.",
      "Zelenskyy said after the meeting in Mar-a-Lago that Putin's words must match his actions. Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump met just a day after Russia launched another blistering attack on Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you for making time.",
      "BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's great to be here. Good to see you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about the state of the economy, because our CBS polling is showing that the most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?",
      "MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.",
      "BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--",
      "MOYNIHAN\u00a0 \u00a0Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?",
      "MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?",
      "MOYNIHAN \u00a0 Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --and medium size businesses--",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.",
      "BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.",

What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.",
      "BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--",
      "MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.",
      "BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.",
      "BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.",
      "BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?",
      "MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.",
      "BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.",
      "BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?",
      "MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.",
      "BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--",
      "BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.",
      "BRENNAN:\u00a0 Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.",
      "MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--",
      "BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.",
      "BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.",
      "MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.",
      "BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?",
      "MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.",
      "BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--",
      "MOYNIHAN: --even\u2013",
      "BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 --20 years ago--",
      "BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--",
      "MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--",
      "BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.",
      "BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?",
      "MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--",
      "BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.",
      "MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.",
      "BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?",
      "MOYNIHAN: Yes.",
      "BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.",
      "MOYNIHAN:\u00a0 Happy Holidays, thank you.",
      "BRENNAN: Happy Holidays to you.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-korea-mine-could-soon-supply-us-with-critical-mineral-tungsten/",
    "published": "Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "China dominates the supply of critical minerals such as tungsten, but a U.S. push for alternative sources has found one, deep inside a South Korean mountain.",
    "story": [
      "Sangdong mine, South Korea \u2014 Over the course of decades, China has come to dominate the rare earths and critical minerals industries, virtually cornering the market on raw materials that are essential to every aspect of modern life, from cellphones to armor piercing ammunition and AI missile guidance systems.",
      "Beijing's stranglehold on the production of these valuable metals and minerals has driven a hasty search by U.S. authorities to secure alternative supply options.",
      "Lewis Black says his company is ready to help fill the void, at least when it comes to the supply of tungsten, a mineral he calls \"vital\" to U.S. defense needs.",
      "Black, CEO of the Canadian mining company Almonty Industries, flew from New York to South Korea last week to give CBS News a tour of the mine he hopes will soon be producing enough tungsten to meet at least the most urgent of America's needs.",
      "In the days before his flight to the Sangdong mine, Black met with U.S. officials, including at the White House, and he signed a deal guaranteeing that Almonty will, in the future, supply enough tungsten for U.S. security needs.",
      "Black said he couldn't discuss the details of the agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Tungsten's superpower",
      "The power of tungsten is rooted in the fact that it has the highest melting point of any element. While used in everyday items from electrical wiring to semiconductors and batteries, its applications in the defense industry make it truly indispensable.",
      "\"It's vital. It's further than critical, it's vital,\" Black told CBS News, standing in an enormous red building covered in corrugated steel sheeting that houses his processing plant in Sangdong.",
      "As he spoke, machinery that breaks down the ore \u2014 the rocks embedded with tungsten \u2014 ground in a slow circular motion, undergoing tests in preparation for being fully commissioned later this year.",
      "\"It's not just in the things you can see like munitions and armor,\" Black said. \"You want to build armored vehicles? All the engineering, all the AI chips, AI chips you can't build without tungsten gas. You want to build a plane? The rockets, it's in everything. It's a vital component, a small one, but without it, you can't do it.\"",
      "The Sangdong tungsten mine's rise, fall and renaissance",
      "Tungsten was first discovered in a rocky outcrop at the Sangdong site, about 115 miles southeast of Seoul, in 1906. A Japanese company started mining there about a decade later, and the tungsten extracted was later used for Japan's war machine during the Second World War.",
      "The end of that war brought an end to Japan's occupation of the Korean Peninsula, and the Sangdong mine returned to Korean control. It would go on to have a profound effect on South Korea's economy, at one point accounting for 30% of the nation's GDP.",
      "South Korean presidents visited the mine at least six times \u2014 it was a source of national pride. But in the 1990s, it fell victim to China's price dumping policies and was mothballed.",
      "For the ensuing three decades, the U.S., along with many other Western nations, benefited from the cheap, government subsidized materials being produced by China.",
      "But that benefit became a reliance, and it left Washington exposed and vulnerable amid a tense trade war with China that's seen Beijing impose export restrictions on some rare earths and other critical materials.",
      "In response, there's been a rush to establish alternative supply chains.",
      "China controls at least 80% of the world's current tungsten supplies, according to Almonty, with Russia and North Korea both holding a smaller but significant share of the assets.",
      "Almonty Industries is in the process of relocating its headquarters to New York. It's a clear indication that the U.S. government has become a very important part of Black's business \u2014 his biggest customer, in fact.",
      "Almonty took ownership of the Sandong mine in 2015.",
      "Catching up with China is \"going to be disruptive\"",
      "Almonty also has tungsten mines in Spain and Portugal, and it recently purchased one in Montana, specifically in the interest, Black said, of U.S. national security.",
      "\"With the U.S. government, that's one of the reasons why we've taken a mine in the U.S. \u2014 bringing our technology to the country so that we can start to generate more human capital for the long term,\" he said. \"To me it feels good for the legacy of the company to fill a gap that has been left hugely exposed.\"",
      "Black said the mine in Montana won't be operational for years, however, as Almonty still needs to secure permits and train personnel. It's all analogous, he notes, to the overarching problem the U.S. and its Western partners have as they seek to untangle themselves from supply chain reliance on China; it's going to take a long time.",
      "\"China dominates so many different sectors, whether it be rare earths, lithium, graphite, tin, lead, aluminum,\" Black said, adding that over the last eight decades many such industries simply \"fell out of favor in the West, and we abandoned raw materials.\"",
      "There are more recently discovered sources of some key materials, particularly in Africa, and the U.S. has sought to build business ties there \u2014 but Black says China has \"covered most bases,\" already securing investment in many African nations through its \"Belt and Road\" initiative.",
      "He believes it will take at least a decade for the U.S. to completely diversify its supply chains, not least because of the need to train a workforce.",
      "\"We don't have the people to run these mines,\" Black told CBS News. \"The U.S. and the West have some catching up to do.\"",
      "In the interim, he expects American industry to face some disruption.",
      "\"I bought this 10 years ago,\" he said of the Sangdong facility. \"Mines in democracies are a journey, and not for the faint hearted.\"",
      "Black expects \"it's going to be a really tough, miserable journey\" as industries such as the American automotive sector work to wean themselves off cheap Chinese raw materials.",
      "\"You want to onshore all this production but you have no way of producing the components to supply this production. This has got to be done \u2026 It's going to be disruptive, there are going to be times when some sectors are going to run out of components \u2014 that's inevitable. In this particular instance, everyone is going to just suck it up and just power forward, because it's the only way it can be done.\"",
      "A few months ago the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency put out a Request for Information (RFI) for tungsten \u2014 effectively an SOS call for the critical mineral, which surprised some in the industry as it effectively exposed the U.S. shortage.",
      "\"I think the U.S. government is saying, 'all right, whatever we can find, we'd better stash it while we build this supply chain,'\" said Black.",
      "He expects the Sangdong to be operational by the first quarter of 2026, and once it is, it should be running 16 hours a day, with the associated processing plant operational 24 hours per day, producing an estimated 1.2 million tons of tungsten ore per year.",

      "Al Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner, has received international praise for disarming one of two gunmen accused of perpetrating the Dec. 14 mass shooting, which was Australia's worst since 1996. Surveillance footage showed him leap out from behind a parked car along the beachfront and wrestle one assailant to the ground, successfully disarming him before al Ahmed became wounded himself.",

I hold him with my right hand and start saying a word, you know, like to warn him, drop your gun, stop doing what you're doing, and it's come all in fast,\" al Ahmed said of his struggle to remove the weapon from the gunman's grasp. \"And emotionally, I'm doing something, which is I feel something, a power in my body, my brain ... I don't want to see people killed in front of me, I don't want to hear his gun, I don't want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help, and that's my soul asking me to do that.\"",
      "He added, \"Everything in my heart, in my brain, everything, it's worked just to manage to save the peoples' life.\"",

      "\"The brain consumes around 20% of your body\u2019s energy and has high demand for NAD+ for cellular energy production and DNA repair,\" Brenner, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"This is because NAD+ plays a key role in the way that neurons adapt to a range of physiological stressors and support processes associated with brain health.\"",

      "The ACS estimates that 67,440 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2025, and about 51,980 are expected to die from it. The tumor\u2019s biology creates physical and chemical barriers that reduce the effectiveness of many traditional treatments.",

      "The treatment uses special immune cells called natural killer T (NKT) cells, which are genetically modified so they can specifically recognize and attack pancreatic cancer cells.",
      "Early research is exploring new approaches to pancreatic cancer, including experimental immunotherapies and studies of risk factors, but many findings are still in preclinical or observational stages. (iStock)",
      "Unlike personalized therapies, the NKT cells are naturally compatible with different immune systems and can be mass-produced from donor stem cells.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Researchers estimate that one donor could supply cells for thousands of treatments, with a potential cost of around $5,000 per dose. All testing so far has been done in mice, and human trials have not yet begun.",

      "Those who are experiencing symptoms should consult with a healthcare professional.",
      "Pancreatic cancer risk is influenced by a combination of genetic, medical and lifestyle factors.",

      "As New York City voters began heading to the polls for early voting, billionaires, including Red Apple Media CEO John Catsimatidis and hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, urged Sliwa to drop out of the race to consolidate support for Cuomo, but the Republican nominee refused.",
      "Similar pressure mounted following the primary for either Cuomo or Adams to drop out to boost the anti-Mamdani vote. After Adams suspended his campaign, he ultimately endorsed Cuomo. Trump's Justice Department dropped bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy charges against Adams earlier this year.",

      "His campaign played into the hands of an evolving \u2014 and chronically online \u2014 New York City electorate.",
      "Scrolling through Mamdani's social media, his TikTok and Instagram pages resemble that of a New York City influencer. From the film-like filters and consistent fonts on his vertical videos to the cameos from celebrities, including model Emily Ratajkowski and comedian Bowen Yang, Mamdani's videos regularly amass millions of views.",
      "During the general election, Mamdani's campaign collaborated with content creators, inviting New York City's micro-influencers to a \"New Media\" briefing, which is typically reserved for legacy media, and continuing to walk through the revolving door of podcast appearances, akin to such efforts by Trump in 2024.",
      "Also similar to Trump in 2024, Mamdani centered his mayoral campaign on affordability, vowing to deliver a New York City that voters could actually afford to live in.",

      "\"It tells me that no matter what your politics are, you're feeling the same crisis, and this is a movement that looks to address that crisis [of affordability],\" Mamdani said. \"No matter who you are, no matter where you live.\"",

      "Department of Justice officials are facing threats of legal action after the department missed the Epstein Files Transparency Act's stated deadline to publish all its documents related to Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 but the law may lean in the DOJ's favor.",
      "DOJ officials have continued to review and upload the files more than a week after the congressionally mandated Dec. 19 due date, spurring Democrats and some Republicans to call for a range of consequences, from contempt to civil litigation. The DOJ is, however, defending the drawn-out release process, suggesting that rushing to publish piles of unexamined material would also flout the law.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a recent interview on \"Meet the Press\" there was \"well-settled law\" that supported the DOJ missing the transparency bill's deadline because of a need to meet other legal requirements in the bill, like redacting victim-identifying information.",

      "The bill required the DOJ to withhold information about potential victims and material that could jeopardize open investigations or litigation. Officials could also leave out information \"in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,\" the bill said, while keeping visible any details that could embarrass politically connected people.",
      "Last week, the DOJ revealed that two of its components, the FBI and the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York, had just gathered and submitted more than 1 million additional pages of potentially responsive documents related to Epstein\u2019s and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s sex trafficking cases for review.",
      "The \"mass volume of material\" could \"take a few more weeks\" to sift through, the DOJ said in a statement, adding that the department would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump\u2019s direction to release the files.\"",
      "Blanche notified Congress in a letter on Dec. 19 that new documents were still surfacing. The DOJ must, therefore, \"publicly produce responsive documents on a rolling basis,\" Blanche said. The deputy attorney general said \"rolling productions\" aligned with court precedents that said laws like the transparency act cannot be interpreted to \"[demand] the impossible.\"",
      "The DOJ\u2019s concerns about page volume and redaction requirements also echo those frequently raised in similar litigation surrounding compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests, where courts have routinely stepped in to balance competing interests of parties in the cases rather than force compliance on an unrealistic timetable.",

      "In a separate case, the appellate court sided with Judicial Watch by reversing a lower court ruling as part of a longstanding legal battle the watchdog waged with the DOJ over obtaining Acting Attorney General Sally Yates' emails. The D.C. Circuit Court found that the DOJ could not withhold email attachments from Yates' account and ordered further review on the matter.",

      "This attack relies on how people read. Your brain predicts words instead of scanning each letter. When something looks familiar, you fill in the gaps automatically. On a large desktop monitor, a careful reader might spot the flaw. On a phone, the risk jumps. The address bar often shortens URLs, and the screen leaves little room for close inspection.

Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",

      "Typosquatting scams work because they rush you into trusting what looks familiar. These steps slow that moment down and help you spot fake domains before damage is done.",
      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story.

      "OpenAI says it is taking stronger steps to protect teens using its chatbot. Recently, the company updated its behavior guidelines for users under 18 and released new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. The move comes as pressure mounts across the tech industry. Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users. Several recent tragedies have raised serious questions about the role AI chatbots may play in teen mental health.

      "OpenAI announced tougher safety rules for teen users as pressure grows on tech companies to prove AI can protect young people online. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",
      "Put teen safety first, even when it limits freedomEncourage real-world support from family, friends, or professionalsSpeak with warmth and respect without treating teens like adultsBe transparent and remind users that the AI is not human",

      "The company updated its chatbot guidelines for users ages 13 to 17 and launched new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",
      "How parents can help teens use AI safely",
      "OpenAI says parents play a key role in helping teens use AI responsibly. The company stresses that tools alone are not enough. Active guidance matters most.",
      "OpenAI encourages regular conversations between parents and teens about how AI fits into daily life. These discussions should focus on responsible use and critical thinking. Parents are urged to remind teens that AI responses are not facts and can be wrong.",
      "OpenAI provides parental controls that let adults manage how teens interact with AI tools. These tools can limit features and add oversight. The company says safeguards are designed to reduce exposure to higher-risk topics and unsafe interactions. Here are the steps OpenAI recommends parents take.",
      "Confirm your teen's account statusParents should make sure their teen's account reflects the correct age.

      "Parents are encouraged to ask what teens use AI for, when they use it and how it makes them feel. These conversations can reveal unhealthy patterns early.",
      "Experts advise parents to look for increased isolation, emotional reliance on AI or treating chatbot responses as authority. These can signal unhealthy dependence.",

Another option sends 6-digit verification codes by text message through SMS or WhatsApp, depending on the country code. Enabling multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond a password and helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to teen accounts.",
      "Also, consider adding a strong antivirus software that can help block malicious links, fake downloads, and other threats teens may encounter while using AI tools. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond any single app or platform.\u00a0 Using strong antivirus protection and two-factor authentication together helps reduce the risk of account takeovers that could expose teens to unsafe content or impersonation risks.",

      "OpenAI's updated teen safety rules show the company is taking growing concerns seriously. Clearer limits, stronger safeguards, and more transparency are steps in the right direction. Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions. Protecting teens will depend on consistent enforcement, independent oversight, and active family involvement.",

      "Kurt 'The Cyber Guy' Knutsson shares his tips and tricks to avoid holiday shopping scams this winter season on 'Fox Report.'",
      "Data breaches tied to financial services companies are no longer rare, but they still hit harder when Social Security numbers are involved. In the latest incident, U.S.-based fintech company 700Credit has confirmed that the personal data of more than 5.8 million people was exposed. The breach did not originate from a direct compromise of 700Credit's internal network, which makes it more concerning. It began with a third-party integration partner and quietly snowballed over several months before it was detected. By the time the issue was contained, hackers had managed to steal a significant amount of sensitive consumer data.",

      "What went wrong at 700Credit",
      "The company says the breach traces back to July, when a threat actor compromised one of its third-party integration partners, as reported by Bleeping Computer. During that intrusion, the attacker discovered an exposed API that could be used to access customer information linked to 700Credit's dealership clients. The integration partner failed to inform 700Credit about the compromise, allowing the access to continue unnoticed.",
      "Suspicious activity was only detected on October 25, when 700Credit flagged unusual behavior on its systems and launched an internal investigation. The company says it brought in third-party computer forensic specialists to assess the scope of the incident and determine what data had been affected.",
      "According to the company's findings, certain records within its web application were copied without authorization. These records are related to customers of auto dealerships that use 700Credit's services. Managing Director Ken Hill later confirmed that roughly 20% of the consumer data accessible through the affected system was stolen between May and October.",
      "What data was exposed and why it matters",
      "While 700Credit has not published an exhaustive list of every data field involved, the company has confirmed that highly sensitive personal information was exposed. This includes Social Security numbers, which significantly raises the risk of identity theft and financial fraud. When SSNs are compromised, the impact is long-term. You cannot simply change them like a password.",
      "The company has published a dedicated page on its website outlining the breach and the types of information impacted. As part of its response, 700Credit is offering affected individuals 12 months of free identity protection and credit monitoring through TransUnion. You have a 90-day window to enroll in this service after receiving the notification.",
      "Notably, audio streaming platform SoundCloud and adult video sharing platform Pornhub also suffered data breaches tied to third-party vendors. There is no indication that the same vendor was involved in all three incidents, but the cases highlight how risky third-party access can be when vendors handle sensitive consumer data.",

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Data from Happy Returns, a UPS-owned reverse logistics company, shows that nearly one in every 10 retail returns in the United States involves fraud. Retailers now lose an estimated $76.5 billion a year to the problem.",
      "To slow those losses, Happy Returns, which specializes in boxless in-store returns for online purchases, is testing a new artificial intelligence tool that flags fraudulent returns before refunds go out.",

      "Return fraud is costing U.S. retailers billions, with nearly 1 in 10 returns flagged as suspicious, according to data from Happy Returns. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",
      "How return fraud works in the real world",
      "Return fraud often looks harmless on the surface. A shopper requests a refund for a legitimate item. Instead of sending back the real product, they ship something cheaper, damaged or completely different. Retailers often issue refunds before anyone inspects the item. That speed allows fraud to slip through and drives up costs.",
      "Industry data from Happy Returns and the National Retail Federation shows retailers will handle nearly $850 billion in returned goods in 2025, representing almost 16% of total retail sales. According to the same research, an estimated 9% of those returns are fraudulent. The report also finds that many shoppers admit to some form of return policy abuse. Importantly, because Happy Returns conducts in-person item verification and uses AI-powered automated flagging plus audit processes to catch mismatches, the rate of confirmed fraud in its network is much lower than the industry-wide estimate.",
      "Why boxless returns changed the equation",
      "Happy Returns operates nearly 8,000 in-person return drop-off locations inside stores such as Ulta Beauty and Staples, as well as at UPS locations. Shoppers can return eligible items without a box or shipping label, and refunds are often issued quickly after verification. Like any returns channel, fraud attempts can happen, but in-person drop-off, item verification, ongoing flagging and audits help keep confirmed fraud far lower than broader industry averages.",
      "Happy Returns says its boxless, in-person model already blocks many common fraud tactics, including empty boxes, partial returns and fake tracking numbers.\u00a0\"If you never touch the product, you can't actually know what's being returned matches what was sold,\" the company says. Everlane says that physical handling alone acts as a deterrent. \"Just the fact of knowing an individual will physically handle and verify the product at the Return Bar deters fraudsters from even attempting to commit fraud,\" said Jim Green, director of logistics and fulfillment at Everlane.",
      "Still, Happy Returns acknowledges that fraud tactics continue to evolve. Lookalike products and knockoffs can closely resemble the real thing, making subtle differences hard to spot without close inspection.",

      "This holiday season, Happy Returns is piloting its new AI system with select retailers, including Everlane, Revolve and Under Armour, as return volumes spike.",
      "The new AI tool is called Return Vision. It starts working the moment a shopper initiates a return online. The system looks for unusual patterns across return timing, frequency and location. A single return may appear normal on its own. When those signals overlap in suspicious ways, the return is flagged for review before a refund is issued.",
      "At drop-off points, workers can scan item barcodes and see photos of what the item should look like. They can reject obvious mismatches on the spot. Once returns reach Happy Returns hubs in California, Pennsylvania and Mississippi, flagged packages are sent to human auditors. The items are opened and photographed, including images of the front, back and identifying labels.",
      "Those photos are fed back into the AI system, which compares them against official product images and past transaction data. Human teams review the AI assessment and make the final decision. The goal is not automation alone. It is adding multiple layers of review where fraud is harder to hide.",
      "Early results show how effective AI is at catching return fraud",
      "While still in pilot, Happy Returns says Return Vision is showing early results. Less than 1% of returns flowing through its network are flagged as high risk. Of those flagged returns, about 10% are ultimately confirmed as fraud. The average prevented loss per confirmed case is just over $200.",
      "Happy Returns says the system focuses on high-confidence cases, allowing most shoppers to move through returns without delay. The company notes that the tool does not address every form of abuse, such as wardrobing, when customers return worn items.",

The U.S. Postal Service is rolling out similar services. Across retail, 85% of surveyed merchants say they use AI or machine learning to combat fraud. Many say the results have been mixed.

      "How Mixpanel is connected to the breach",
      "The alleged breach appears linked to a separate November security incident involving Mixpanel, a data analytics vendor that previously worked with Pornhub. That earlier breach occurred after a\u00a0smishing attack gave threat actors access to Mixpanel systems. However, Mixpanel says it does not believe Pornhub data came from that incident. The company stated it found no evidence that the data was taken during its November 2025 breach. Pornhub has also clarified that it stopped working with Mixpanel in 2021. That means the stolen data would be several years old. Reuters contacted some Pornhub customers to verify the claims. Those users confirmed the data tied to their accounts was accurate but outdated, which aligns with the Mixpanel timeline.",

      "A VPN helps protect your browsing activity by masking your IP address and encrypting your internet traffic. That is especially relevant in breaches like this one, where exposed activity data may include location signals or usage patterns. While a VPN cannot erase past exposure, it reduces how much new information is visible going forward and makes it harder to link future activity back to you. Using a VPN consistently can also limit tracking across sites, which helps lower your overall digital footprint after a breach.",

      "Apple has released emergency security updates to fix two zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploited in highly targeted attacks.",
      "The company described the activity as an \"extremely sophisticated attack\" aimed at specific individuals. Although Apple did not identify the attackers or victims, the limited scope strongly suggests spyware-style operations rather than widespread cybercrime.",
      "Both flaws affect WebKit, the browser engine behind Safari and all browsers on iOS. As a result, the risk is significant. In some cases, simply visiting a malicious webpage may be enough to trigger an attack.",
      "Below, we break down what these vulnerabilities mean and explain how you can better protect yourself.",

      "NEW IPHONE SCAM TRICKS OWNERS INTO GIVING PHONES AWAY",
      "What Apple says about the zero-day vulnerabilities",
      "The two vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2025-43529 and CVE-2025-14174, and Apple confirmed that both were exploited in the same real-world attacks. According to Apple's security bulletin, the flaws were abused on versions of iOS released before iOS 26, and the attacks were limited to \"specific targeted individuals.\"",
      "CVE-2025-43529 is a WebKit use-after-free vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution when a device processes maliciously crafted web content. To put it simply, it allows attackers to run their own code on a device by tricking the browser into mishandling memory. Apple credited Google's Threat Analysis Group with discovering this flaw, which is often a strong indicator of nation-state or commercial spyware activity.",
      "The second flaw, CVE-2025-14174, is also a WebKit issue, this time involving memory corruption. While Apple describes the impact as memory corruption rather than direct code execution, these types of bugs are often chained together with other vulnerabilities to fully compromise a device. Apple says this issue was discovered jointly by Apple and Google's Threat Analysis Group.",
      "In both cases, Apple acknowledged that it was aware of reports confirming active exploitation in the wild. That language is important because Apple typically reserves it for situations where attacks have already occurred, not just theoretical risks. The company says it addressed the bugs through improved memory management and better validation checks, without sharing deeper technical details that could help attackers replicate the exploits.",
      "Devices affected and signs of coordinated disclosure",
      "Apple has released patches across its supported operating systems, including the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Safari, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS.",
      "According to Apple's advisory, affected devices include iPhone 11 and newer models, multiple generations of iPad Pro, iPad Air from the third generation onward, the eighth-generation iPad and newer and the iPad mini starting with the fifth generation. This covers the vast majority of iPhones and iPads still in active use today.",
      "Apple has patched the flaws across its entire ecosystem. Fixes are available in iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2, iOS 18.7.3 and iPadOS 18.7.3, macOS Tahoe 26.2, tvOS 26.2, watchOS 26.2, visionOS 26.2 and Safari 26.2.

      "This sounds obvious, but it matters more than anything else. Zero-day attacks rely on people running outdated software. If Apple ships an emergency update, install it the same day if you can. Delaying updates is often the only window attackers need. If you tend to forget about updates, let your devices handle them for you. Enable automatic updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS and Safari. That way, you are protected even if you miss the news or are traveling.",
      "Most WebKit exploits start with malicious web content. Avoid tapping on random links sent over SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or email unless you are expecting them. If something feels off, open the site later by typing the address yourself.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If you are a journalist, an activist or someone who deals with sensitive information, consider reducing your attack surface. Use Safari only, avoid unnecessary browser extensions, and limit how often you open links inside messaging apps.",
      "Apple's Lockdown Mode is designed specifically for targeted attacks. It restricts certain web technologies, blocks most message attachments, and limits attack vectors commonly used by spyware. It is not for everyone, but it exists for situations like this.",
      "Targeted attacks often start with profiling. The more personal data about you that is floating around online, the easier it is to pick you as a target. Removing data from broker sites and tightening social media privacy settings can lower your visibility.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Unexpected crashes, overheating, sudden battery drain or Safari closing on its own can sometimes be warning signs. These do not automatically mean your device is compromised. However, if something feels consistently wrong, updating immediately and resetting the device is a smart move.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Apple has not shared details about who was targeted or how the attacks were delivered. However, the pattern fits closely with past spyware campaigns that focused on journalists, activists, political figures and others of interest to surveillance operators. With these patches, Apple has now fixed seven zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in the wild in 2025 alone. That includes flaws disclosed earlier this year and a backported fix in September for older devices.",

      "Uber Eats uses four-wheeled robots to handle the final stretch of food delivery.",
      "DoorDash wants to help you decide where to eat, not just how your food arrives. The company has launched Zesty, a new artificial intelligence-powered social app built to make finding local restaurants faster and easier.",
      "Zesty is now in public testing in the San Francisco Bay Area and New York. Instead of scrolling through endless reviews, menus and social videos, the app lets you ask an AI chatbot for recommendations in plain language.",
      "Think of it as a digital concierge for food discovery.",

      "How Zesty works",
      "Once you open Zesty and sign in with your DoorDash account, the experience feels familiar and simple. You see nearby restaurants and a chat box where you can type exactly what you want. DoorDash says users can ask prompts like:",
      "The app blends AI search with social discovery, showing photos, comments and saved spots shared by other diners. \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "A low-key dinner in Williamsburg that's good for introverts",
      "Brunch spots good for groups",
      "Romantic dinner with a vintage feel",
      "The AI then curates recommendations by pulling information from DoorDash data, Google Maps, TikTok, Reddit and other sources. According to DoorDash co-founder Andy Fang, the goal is to surface the best suggestions from across the web in one place. Each recommendation includes context such as ratings, social buzz and where the suggestion came from. DoorDash says the results do not imply sponsorships or paid placements.",
      "A social network built around food",
      "Zesty also adds a social layer. Users can post photos, leave comments, follow other diners and share saved spots with friends. If you find a restaurant that looks promising, you can bookmark it for later or send it to someone planning dinner with you. This makes Zesty feel less like a search engine and more like a food-focused social network. It is designed for people who enjoy discovering places through other people's experiences, not just star ratings. For DoorDash, this is a clear shift toward community-driven discovery.",
      "Why DoorDash built Zesty",
      "DoorDash wants to remove friction from the decision process. Instead of bouncing among Google, TikTok, Yelp and delivery apps, Zesty aims to bring everything together in a single guided experience. That approach also aligns with a broader trend. More people already use AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini to plan meals and trips. Zesty aims to offer that same convenience with a strong local and social focus.",
      "Zesty lets users ask for restaurant recommendations in natural language instead of scrolling through endless reviews and menus. (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)",
      "\"At DoorDash, we're always looking for new ways to help people connect with the best of their communities,\" a company spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We're piloting an app called Zesty to make it easier to discover great nearby restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and more through personalized search and social sharing. Zesty is now in public beta in San Francisco and New York, and we're excited to learn from early testers as we keep shaping what local discovery can look like.\"",
      "Of course, Zesty faces an uphill climb. Many users already rely on Google Maps or existing social apps to find restaurants. Some may not want to download another standalone app, even if it promises better recommendations. Still, Zesty could appeal to users who enjoy food discovery as a social activity. For them, a dedicated network built around local dining may feel more useful than generic search results. DoorDash appears willing to test that idea and see how users respond.\u00a0For now, the company is focused on getting people to use the app, learning what works, and fine-tuning its matching engine. Once that experience feels right, Zesty will expand to more cities.",
      "WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?",
      "Part of DoorDash's bigger expansion plan",
      "Zesty is not an isolated experiment. It fits into DoorDash's broader push beyond food delivery. Earlier this year, DoorDash rolled out features for in-person dining reservations and in-store rewards. The company also continues to invest heavily in automation and AI-driven logistics.",
      "We reported a few months ago on another major innovation from DoorDash: Dot, its fast new autonomous delivery robot. Dot is designed for short local trips and runs on an AI-powered delivery platform that decides whether an order should be handled by a Dasher, a robot or another method. Together, Zesty and Dot show how DoorDash is trying to own more of the local commerce experience, from discovery to delivery.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you enjoy trying new restaurants, Zesty could save you time and decision fatigue. Instead of reading dozens of reviews, you can ask for exactly what you want and get curated suggestions instantly. For casual diners, the app may feel unnecessary if Google already works fine. For food lovers who like sharing finds and following others with similar tastes, Zesty could become a useful daily tool. It also signals where local discovery may be heading. AI-driven recommendations paired with social proof could soon replace traditional review hunting.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Zesty is now in beta in San Francisco and New York as DoorDash tests and refines its personalized matching experience. (iStock)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Zesty shows DoorDash experimenting with how people choose where to eat, not just how food gets delivered. By combining AI search with social sharing, the company is testing a more conversational and community-driven approach to local discovery. Whether Zesty becomes essential or stays niche will depend on how well it delivers meaningful recommendations. Still, it highlights DoorDash's growing ambition to shape more parts of our everyday local life.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Typing a web address directly into your browser feels harmless. In fact, it feels normal. But new research shows that a simple habit is now one of the riskiest things you can do online. A recent study from cybersecurity firm Infoblox reveals a troubling shift.",
      "Most parked domains now redirect visitors to scams, malware or fake security warnings. In many cases, this happens instantly. You do not have to click anything. That means a single typo can expose your device.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What are parked domains?",
      "Parked domains are unused or expired web addresses. Many exist because someone forgot to renew a domain. Others are deliberate misspellings of popular sites like Google, Netflix or YouTube. For years, these domains displayed harmless placeholder pages. They showed ads and links to monetize accidental traffic. While annoying, they rarely posed serious danger. That is no longer true. Infoblox found that more than 90 percent of visits to parked domains now lead to malicious content. This includes scareware, fake antivirus offers, phishing pages and malware downloads.",
      "A single mistyped web address can redirect you from a trusted site to a dangerous parked domain in seconds, Kurt Knutsson writes. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)",
      "Why direct navigation has become so risky",
      "Direct navigation means typing a website address by hand instead of using a bookmark or search result. One missing letter can change everything. For example, mistyping gmail.com as gmai.com does not trigger an error. Instead, it can deliver your email straight to criminals. Infoblox found that some of these typo domains actively run mail servers to capture messages. Even worse, many of these domains form part of massive portfolios. One group tracked by Infoblox controlled nearly 3,000 lookalike domains associated with banks, tech companies and government services.",
      "Malicious parked domains often trigger fake security warnings or hidden redirects without requiring any clicks. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "How these domains decide whom to attack",
      "Not everyone sees the same thing when visiting a parked domain. That is intentional. Researchers discovered that parked pages often profile visitors in real time. They analyze IP address, device type, location, cookies and browsing behavior. Based on that data, the domain decides what you see next. Visitors using a VPN or non-residential connection often see harmless placeholder pages. Residential users on phones or home computers get redirected to scams or malware instead. This filtering helps attackers stay hidden while maximizing successful attacks.",
      "Why parked domain scams are increasing",
      "Several trends are fueling the problem. First, traffic from parked domains is often resold multiple times through affiliate networks. By the time it reaches a malicious advertiser, there is no direct relationship with the original parking company. Second, recent ad policy changes may have increased exposure. Google now requires advertisers to opt in before running ads on parked domains. While intended to improve safety, this shift may have pushed bad actors deeper into affiliate networks with weaker oversight. The result is a murky ecosystem where responsibility is difficult to trace.",
      "Even government domains are being targeted",
      "Infoblox also found typosquatting aimed at government services. In one case, a researcher accidentally visited ic3.org instead of ic3.gov while trying to report a crime. The result was a fake warning page claiming a cloud subscription had expired. That page could just as easily have delivered malware. This highlights how easy it is to fall into these traps, even when doing something important.",
      "A screenshot shows how mistyping the FBI\u2019s IC3 web address redirects users to an unrelated parked domain. (Infoblox)",
      "Ways to stay safe from parked domain traps",
      "You can reduce your risk with a few smart habits:",
      "Save banks, email providers and government portals. Avoid typing these addresses manually.",
      "Slow down when entering web addresses. One extra second can prevent a costly mistake.",
      "Strong antivirus software protects your device if a malicious page loads, blocking malware downloads, scripts and fake security pop-ups.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "At first glance, the rapid rollout might seem surprising. But there's context behind it. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has reportedly called a \"code red\" inside the company, urging teams to move faster on improving ChatGPT. That push comes as competition heats up. Google recently released Gemini 3, which reportedly outperformed ChatGPT on several artificial intelligence benchmarks and delivered stronger image generation. At the same time, Anthropic's Claude continues to advance quickly.",
      "Against that backdrop, GPT-5.2 feels less like a routine upgrade and more like a strategic response. So what actually changed in GPT-5.2, and why does OpenAI say it matters?",

      "What exactly is GPT-5.2",
      "GPT-5.2 is the newest version in OpenAI's flagship 5-series of large language models. Like its predecessor, it includes two default variants. GPT-5.2 Instant is designed for everyday chatting and web searches. GPT-5.2 Thinking is meant for more complex tasks like long reasoning chains and multi-step problem solving. These two models are now the default for all ChatGPT users, including free users. They replace GPT-5.1 Instant and Thinking entirely. If you are using ChatGPT today, you are already using GPT-5.2, whether you realize it or not.",
      "What OpenAI says GPT-5 brings to ChatGPT",
      "At the same time, OpenAI continues to position GPT-5 as \"expert intelligence for everyone.\" The company says GPT-5 delivers stronger performance across math, science, finance, law and other complex subjects. In OpenAI's view, ChatGPT now acts more like a team of on-demand experts than a basic chatbot. To support that claim, OpenAI points to practical examples. These include better coding help, more expressive writing support, clearer health-related explanations and improved safety and accuracy. The company showcases use cases such as generating app code, writing speeches, explaining medications and correcting mistakes in user-submitted images. In theory, GPT-5.2 builds on that same foundation. However, while OpenAI emphasizes deeper thinking and more reliable answers, those gains remain subtle for many everyday users.",
      "What new features does GPT-5.2 add?",
      "Here's the short answer. None. GPT-5.2 does not introduce new tools, interfaces, or headline features. Instead, OpenAI describes a series of behind-the-scenes improvements that supposedly make ChatGPT faster, smarter and more capable. According to OpenAI, GPT-5.2 performs better at:",

      "Why testing chatbot improvements is tricky",
      "Evaluating chatbot upgrades is harder than it sounds. Responses can vary widely even when prompts stay the same. A model might excel at one task and struggle with a nearly identical one just moments later. On top of that, OpenAI's 5-series models already perform at or near the top of the field. When performance starts that high, meaningful gains become harder to detect. With that in mind, we tested GPT-5.2, and in most tests, it behaved almost identically to GPT-5.1.",
      "Why benchmarks don't tell the full story",
      "OpenAI's benchmarks show modest gains for GPT-5.2. That matters for researchers and developers working at scale. Still, even advanced users may struggle to see practical benefits. Other companies have delivered clearer upgrades. Google's Gemini Nano Banana Pro model shows obvious gains in AI image generation and editing. Those improvements are easy for anyone to test and verify. By contrast, GPT-5.2's changes feel abstract. They exist mostly on paper rather than in daily use.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you pay for ChatGPT, there's little downside to using GPT-5.2. It replaces GPT-5.1 in the model lineup and generally performs at least as well in everyday use. Free users don't have much choice either, as model access is handled automatically. For most people, the experience feels familiar and stable.",
      "The picture shifts slightly for programmers and those who use it for business. Early pricing details suggest GPT-5.2 may cost roughly 40 percent more per million tokens than GPT-5.1, depending on usage tier and access method. That makes testing important before committing at scale.",
      "ChatGPT-5.2 works fine but may not feel exciting, Kurt Knutsson writes. (Michael Nguyen/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "In short, GPT-5.2 works fine. It simply may not feel exciting.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "GPT-5.2 feels like a model released under pressure rather than inspiration. It performs well, stays reliable, and moves forward in measurable ways. Still, it doesn't deliver the kind of clear progress many people expect from a new version number. OpenAI remains a leader in AI, but competition is closing in fast. As rivals roll out more noticeable improvements, small updates may no longer be enough to stand out. For now, GPT-5.2 feels less like a breakthrough and more like OpenAI holding its ground.",

      "Over the past few weeks, we've heard from a number of people who received unexpected phone calls shortly after activating a new iPhone. The callers claimed to be from a major carrier. They said a shipping mistake was made. They insisted the phone needed to be returned right away. One message stood out because it shows exactly how convincing and aggressive this scam can be.",
      "\"Somebody called me (the call said it was from Spectrum) and told me they sent the wrong iPhone and needed to replace it. I was to rip off the label on the box, tape it up and set it on my porch steps. FedEx was going to pick it up and they'd put a label on it. And just for my trouble, he'd send me a $100 gift card! However, the guy was just too anxious. He called me again at 7 am to make sure I would follow his instructions. Right after that, I picked up my box on the steps and called Spectrum, who confirmed it was a scam. There are no such things as refurbished i17 phones because they're brand new. I called the guy back, said a few choice words and hung up on him. Since then, they have called at least twice for the same thing. Spectrum should be warning its customers!\"",

      "How the new iPhone replacement scam works",
      "This scam relies on timing and pressure. First, criminals focus on people who recently bought a new iPhone. That information often comes from data-broker sites, leaked purchase data or marketing lists sold online. Next, scammers spoof a carrier phone number. As a result, the call appears legitimate. They sound confident and informed because they already know the device model you ordered.",
      "Once the call begins, the story moves quickly. The scammer claims a shipping mistake occurred. Then they insist the phone must be returned right away. To reinforce urgency, they say a courier is already scheduled. If you follow the instructions, you hand over a brand-new iPhone. At that point, the device is gone. The scammer either resells it or strips it for parts. By the time you realize something is wrong, recovery is unlikely.",
      "Why this scam feels so believable",
      "This scam copies real customer service processes. Carriers do ship replacement phones. FedEx does handle returns. Gift cards are often used as apologies.

    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on Special Report.",
      "Amazon's Ring video doorbells are getting a major artificial intelligence (AI) upgrade, and it is already stirring controversy.",
      "The company has started rolling out a new feature called Familiar Faces to Ring owners across the United States. Once enabled, the feature uses AI-powered facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door. Instead of a generic alert saying a person is at your door, you might see something far more personal, like \"Mom at Front Door.\" On the surface, that sounds convenient.",
      "Privacy advocates, however, say this shift comes with real risks.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Ring\u2019s new Familiar Faces feature uses AI facial recognition to identify people who regularly appear at your door and personalize alerts. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",
      "How Ring's Familiar Faces feature works",
      "Ring says Familiar Faces helps you manage alerts by recognizing people you know. Here is how it works in practice. You can create a catalog of up to 50 faces. These may include family members, friends, neighbors, delivery drivers, household staff or other frequent visitors. After labeling a face in the Ring app, the camera will recognize that person as they approach. Anyone who regularly passes in front of your Ring camera can be labeled by the device owner if they choose to do so, even if that person is unaware they are being identified.",
      "From there, Ring sends personalized notifications tied to that face. You can also fine-tune alerts on a per-face basis, which means fewer pings for your own comings and goings. Importantly, the feature is not enabled by default. You must turn it on manually in the Ring app settings. Faces can be named directly from Event History or from the Familiar Faces library. You can edit names, merge duplicates or delete faces at any time.",
      "Amazon says unnamed faces are automatically removed after 30 days. Once a face is labeled, however, that data remains stored until the user deletes it.",
      "Why privacy groups are pushing back",
      "Despite Amazon's assurances, consumer protection groups and lawmakers are raising alarms. Ring has a long history of working with law enforcement. In the past, police and fire departments were able to request footage through the Ring Neighbors app. More recently, Amazon partnered with Flock, a company that makes AI-powered surveillance cameras widely used by police and federal agencies. Ring has also struggled with internal security. In 2023, the FTC fined Ring $5.8 million after finding that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customer videos for years. The Neighbors app previously exposed precise home locations, and Ring account credentials have repeatedly surfaced online. Because of these issues, critics argue that adding facial recognition expands the risk rather than reducing it.",
      "Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) staff attorney Mario Trujillo tells CyberGuy, \"When you step in front of one of these cameras, your faceprint is taken and stored on Amazon\u2019s servers, whether you consent or not. Today\u2019s feature to recognize your friend at your front door can easily be repurposed tomorrow for mass surveillance. It is important for state regulators to investigate.\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation is a well-known nonprofit organization that focuses on digital privacy, civil liberties and consumer rights in the tech space.",
      "WASHINGTON COURT SAYS FLOCK CAMERA IMAGES ARE PUBLIC RECORDS",
      "Once a face is labeled by the device owner, Ring can replace generic notifications with named alerts tied to that individual. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "Where the feature is blocked and why that matters",
      "Legal pressure is already limiting where Familiar Faces can launch. According to the EFF, privacy laws are preventing Amazon from offering the feature in Illinois, Texas and Portland, Oregon. These jurisdictions have stricter biometric privacy protections, which suggests regulators see facial recognition in the home as a higher-risk technology. U.S. Senator Ed Markey has also called on Amazon to abandon the feature altogether, citing concerns about surveillance creep and biometric data misuse.",
      "Amazon says biometric data is processed in the cloud and not used to train AI models. The company also claims it cannot identify all locations where a face appears, even if law enforcement asks. Still, critics point out the similarity to Ring's Search Party feature, which already scans neighborhoods to locate lost pets.",
      "We reached out to Amazon for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "Ring's other AI feature feels very different",
      "Not all of Ring's AI updates raise the same level of concern. Ring recently introduced Video Descriptions, a generative AI feature that summarizes motion activity in plain text. Instead of guessing what triggered an alert, you might see messages like \"A person is walking up the steps with a black dog\" or \"Two people are peering into a white car in the driveway.\"",
      "HOW RESTAURANT RESERVATION PLATFORM OPENTABLE TRACKS CUSTOMER DINING HABITS",
      "Ring\u2019s Video Descriptions feature takes a different approach by summarizing activity without identifying people by name. (Amazon)",
      "How Video Descriptions decides what matters",
      "This AI focuses on actions rather than identities. It helps you quickly decide whether an alert is urgent or routine. Over time, Ring says the system can recognize activity patterns around a home and only notify you when something unusual happens. However, as with any AI system, accuracy can vary depending on lighting, camera angle, distance and environmental conditions. Video Descriptions is currently rolling out in beta to Ring Home Premium subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. Unlike facial recognition, this feature improves clarity without naming or tracking specific people. That contrast matters.",
      "Video Descriptions turns motion alerts into short summaries, helping you understand what is happening without identifying who is involved. (Amazon)",
      "Should you turn Familiar Faces on?",
      "If you own a Ring doorbell, caution is wise. While Familiar Faces may reduce notification fatigue, labeling people by name creates a detailed record of who comes to your home and when. Given Ring's past security lapses and close ties with law enforcement, many privacy experts recommend keeping the feature disabled. If you do use it, avoid full names and remove faces you no longer need. In many cases, simply checking the live video feed is safer than relying on AI labels. Not every smart home feature needs to know who someone is.",
      "How to turn Familiar Faces on or off in the Ring app",
      "If you want to review or change this setting, you can do so at any time in the Ring mobile app.",

      "Alexa is now answering your door for you",
      "Amazon is also rolling out a very different kind of AI feature for Ring doorbells, and it lives inside Alexa+. Called Greetings, this update gives Ring doorbells a conversational AI voice that can interact with people at your door when you are busy or not home. Instead of identifying who someone is, Greetings focuses on what they appear to be doing. Using Ring's video descriptions, the system looks at apparel, actions, and objects to decide how to respond.",
      "For example, if someone in a delivery uniform drops off a package, Alexa can tell them exactly where to leave it based on your instructions. You can even set preferences to guide delivery drivers toward a specific spot, or let them know water or snacks are available. If a delivery requires a signature, Alexa can ask the driver when they plan to return and pass that message along to you. The feature can also handle sales representatives or service vendors. You might set a rule such as politely declining sales pitches without ever coming to the door yourself.",
      "Greetings can also work for friends and family. If someone stops by while you are away, Alexa can greet them and ask them to leave a message for you. That interaction is saved so you can review it later. That said, the system is not perfect. Because it relies on visual context rather than identity, mistakes can happen. A friend who works in logistics could show up wearing a delivery uniform and be treated like a courier instead of being invited to leave a message. Amazon acknowledges that accuracy can vary. Importantly, Amazon says Greetings does not identify who a person is. It uses Ring's video descriptions to determine the main subject in front of the camera and generate responses, without naming or recognizing individuals. That makes it fundamentally different from the Familiar Faces feature, even though both rely on AI.",
      "Greetings is compatible with Ring Wired Doorbell Pro (3rd Gen) and Ring Wired Doorbell Plus (2nd Gen). It is available to Ring Premium Plan subscribers who have video descriptions enabled and is currently rolling out to Alexa+ Early Access users in the United States and Canada.",
      "Thinking about a Ring doorbell?",
      "If you are already in the Ring ecosystem or considering a video doorbell, Ring's lineup includes models with motion alerts, HD video, night vision, and optional AI-powered features such as Video Descriptions. While Familiar Faces remains controversial and can be turned off, many homeowners still use Ring doorbells for basic security awareness and package monitoring.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon Ring's AI facial recognition feature shows how quickly convenience can collide with privacy. Familiar Faces may offer smarter alerts, but it also expands surveillance into deeply personal spaces. Meanwhile, features like Video Descriptions prove that AI can be useful without identifying people. As smart home tech evolves, the real question is not what AI can do but what it should do.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new Android banking trojan called Sturnus is shaping up to be one of the most capable threats we have seen in a while. It is still in early development, but it already behaves like a fully mature operation.",
      "Once it infects a device, it can take over your screen, steal your banking credentials and even read encrypted chats from apps you trust. The worrying part is how quietly it works in the background. You think your messages are safe because they are end-to-end encrypted, but this malware simply waits for the phone to decrypt them before grabbing everything.",
      "It's important to note, however, that Sturnus does not break encryption; it only captures messages after your apps decrypt them on your device.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Sturnus malware uses deceptive screens that mimic real banking apps to steal your credentials in seconds. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "A closer look at the malware's capabilities",
      "Sturnus combines several attack layers that give the operator nearly full visibility into the device, as reported by cybersecurity research firm ThreatFabric. It uses HTML overlays that mimic real banking apps to trick you into typing your credentials. Everything you enter goes straight to the attacker through a WebView that forwards the data instantly. It also runs an aggressive keylogging system through the Android Accessibility Service. This lets it capture text as you type, follow which app is open, and map every UI element on the screen. Even when apps block screenshots, the malware keeps tracking the UI tree in real time, which is enough to reconstruct what you are doing.",
      "NEW ANDROID MALWARE CAN EMPTY YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN SECONDS",
      "On top of overlays and keylogging, the malware monitors WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and other messaging apps. It waits for these apps to decrypt messages locally, then captures the text right from the screen. This means your chats may remain encrypted over the network, but once the message appears on your display, Sturnus sees the entire conversation. It also includes a full remote control feature with live screen streaming and a more efficient mode that sends only interface data. This allows precise taps, text injection, scrolling and permission approvals without showing any activity to the victim.",
      "How Sturnus stays hidden and steals money",
      "The malware protects itself by grabbing Device Administrator privileges and blocking any attempt to remove it. If you open the settings page that could disable those permissions, Sturnus detects it immediately and moves you away from the screen before you can act. It also monitors battery state, SIM changes, developer mode, network conditions and even signs of forensic investigation to decide how to behave. All this data goes back to the command-and-control server through a mix of WebSocket and HTTP channels protected with RSA and AES encryption.",
      "When it comes to financial theft, the malware has several ways to take over your accounts. It can collect credentials through overlays, keylogging, UI-tree monitoring and direct text injection. If needed, it can black out your screen with a full-screen overlay while the attacker performs fraudulent transactions in the background. Since the screen is hidden, you have no idea anything is happening until it is too late.",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from Android malware like Sturnus",
      "If you want to protect yourself from threats like this, here are a few practical things you can start doing right away.",
      "Avoid downloading APKs from forwarded links, shady websites, Telegram groups or third-party app stores. Banking malware spreads most effectively through sideloaded installers disguised as updates, coupons or new features. If you need an app that isn't in the Play Store, verify the developer's official site, check hashes if provided and read recent reviews to make sure the app hasn't been hijacked.",
      "Most dangerous malware relies on accessibility permissions because they allow full visibility into your screen and interactions. Device administrator rights are even more powerful since they can block removal. If a simple utility app suddenly asks for these, stop immediately. These permissions should only be granted to apps that genuinely need them, such as password managers or accessibility tools you trust.",
      "Install system updates as soon as they arrive, since many Android banking trojans target older devices that lack the latest security patches. If your phone is no longer receiving updates, you are at a higher risk, especially when using financial apps. Avoid sideloading custom ROMs unless you know how they handle security patches and Google Play Protect.",
      "HOW ANDROID MALWARE LETS THIEVES ACCESS YOUR ATM CASH",
      "The malware quietly captures decrypted messages from apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal right as they appear on your screen. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Android phones come with Google Play Protect built in, which catches a large chunk of known malware families and warns you when apps behave suspiciously. But if you want greater security and control, choose a third-party antivirus app. These tools can alert you when an app starts logging your screen or trying to take over your phone.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "A lot of these campaigns rely on data brokers, leaked databases and scraped profiles to build lists of people to target. If your phone number, email, address or social handles are floating around on dozens of broker sites, it becomes much easier for attackers to reach you with malware links or tailored scams. A personal data removal service helps clean up that footprint by deleting your info from data broker listings.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy.

      "A quiet town in western Denmark is quickly becoming a testing ground for the future of housing.",
      "Skovsporet, described as Europe's largest 3D-printed housing project, is now taking shape in Holstebro. When finished, the development will deliver 36 student apartments built faster than many single-family homes.",
      "The project sits near VIA University College and serves students in the area. NordVestBo, an affordable housing organization focused on student living, commissioned the development. SAGA Space Architects designed the project in collaboration with 3DCP Group and COBOD. From the beginning, the goal stayed simple and ambitious. Build high-quality homes faster, more efficiently and at a scale traditional construction often struggles to reach. So far, the progress speaks for itself.",

      "AUSTRALIA DEBUTS FIRST MULTI-STORY 3D PRINTED HOME \u2013 BUILT IN JUST 5 MONTHS",
      "The six buildings are arranged around shared outdoor areas, creating a village-style layout designed for student life. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "How 36 student apartments were printed at record speed",
      "Skovsporet includes six buildings, and each one holds six ground-level student apartments. Crews printed the structures on site using the COBOD BOD3 3D construction printer. The machine extrudes a cement-like material layer by layer, following a digital blueprint with millimeter accuracy.",
      "At first, printing a single building took several weeks. However, productivity improved quickly as the team gained experience. By the final building, printing wrapped up in just five days. That pace equals more than one student apartment printed per day.",
      "Even more notable is the small crew required to run the system. Only three people operated the printer on site. As a result, automation handled the heavy work while the team focused on oversight, quality and precision.",
      "Inside the 3D-printed student apartments",
      "Each apartment measures roughly 431 to 538 square feet. Despite their compact footprint, the layouts feel open and intentional. Every unit includes a full kitchen, a study area, a lounge, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom with a double bed. Large roof windows and slanted ceilings pull daylight deep into the space, helping soften the concrete structure. Inside, coated plywood panels and glass elements add warmth and contrast. The result feels modern and livable rather than industrial. These homes are designed for daily student life, not just architectural headlines.",
      "AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE",
      "Why 3D printed construction is changing how housing gets built",
      "The real story at Skovsporet is not just speed. It is repeatability. As the team moved from one building to the next, efficiency improved without sacrificing quality. The BOD3 printer runs on a ground-based track system that allows uninterrupted printing of long wall sections. That consistency makes it easier to scale multi-unit housing projects.",
      "According to COBOD, this kind of automation reduces labor needs, shortens timelines and improves accuracy. For cities facing housing shortages, those benefits matter.",
      "How sustainability is built into this 3D printed housing project",
      "Skovsporet also shows how 3D printing supports more sustainable construction. The walls were printed using D.fab concrete with FUTURECEM, a low-carbon cement developed by Aalborg Portland. Because the printer deposits material only where it is structurally needed, waste drops significantly compared to traditional methods. The site layout also preserved 95% of the existing trees by carefully positioning print beds between them. In other words, faster construction did not come at the cost of environmental care.",
      "A COBOD BOD3 printer extrudes concrete layer-by-layer on site, forming the structural walls of Skovsporet\u2019s student apartments with millimeter precision. (SAGA Space Architects)",
      "What happens next for Denmark's 3D-printed student housing",
      "The 3D printing phase is now complete. Human crews have taken over to install roofs, windows, interiors, furniture and utilities. Landscaped gardens, walking paths and bicycle parking are also underway to create a shared village atmosphere. The project remains on schedule, with residents expected to move in by August 2026.",
      "WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you care about housing affordability, this project is worth watching. Skovsporet proves that automation can deliver student housing faster while keeping quality high. It also hints at what could come next. Multiunit housing built with fewer workers, less waste and shorter timelines could ease pressure in crowded cities. While 3D-printed homes will not replace traditional construction overnight, they are clearly moving into the mainstream. For students, renters and communities, that shift could open the door to more accessible housing options.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Skovsporet is more than a construction milestone. It is a real-world example of how digital design, automation and sustainability can come together at scale. As Europe, the United States and Australia explore similar projects, this student village in Denmark may become a blueprint for future neighborhoods.",

      "A judge ruled that the transcript and audio recording of a closed-door hearing involving the accused assassin of Charlie Kirk can be released in redacted forms during a hearing on how much access the public should have as his capital case proceeds in Provo, Utah.",
      "Fourth District Judge Tony Graf Jr. said the redactions amounted to 246 words in the 80-page transcript. The transcript was released on Monday afternoon, but Graf said it would take about two weeks to redact and release the audio recording.",
      "The newly unsealed transcript shows that the Oct. 24 hearing opened with Tyler Robinson\u2019s defense attorneys asking the court to allow him to keep one hand unshackled so he could take notes and write during the proceedings.",
      "Graf allowed the hearing to move forward after consulting with court security. Portions of that exchange remain redacted, including a statement by a bailiff that is entirely blacked out, leaving unclear what specific security concerns were discussed behind closed doors.",

      "The transcript also reflects that Robinson spoke only briefly in response to a question from the judge at the beginning of the hearing and otherwise remained silent as attorneys discussed courtroom security, media access and upcoming motions. Graf told the parties he intended to proceed cautiously, saying he preferred to take additional time rather than \"be rash and miss the mark.\"",
      "During arguments over whether Robinson should appear shackled in court, Graf emphasized that security decisions ultimately rest with the court, not jail officials.",
      "\"This is not a jail. This is your honor\u2019s courtroom,\" Graf said, adding that \"what security measures are necessary to ensure everybody\u2019s safety, including Mr. Robinson\u2019s, are your honor\u2019s decisions, not the sheriff\u2019s decisions.\"",
      "Graf also pushed back on arguments tying heightened security to the intense public attention surrounding the case. Referencing claims about unstable individuals and online conspiracy theories, he dismissed much of that concern as external noise.",
      "\"We\u2019re all aware of that\u2026 I\u2019ve received some wacky phone calls and e-mails, people telling me what they think happened here. It\u2019s noise,\" Graf said, stressing that those factors should not dictate how the case is handled inside the courtroom.",

      "At another point, Graf underscored the broader stakes of the proceedings, acknowledging that Robinson\u2019s prosecution stands apart from routine cases. \"This case is unique. Whether we like it or not, this case is unique,\" he said.",
      "Robinson, 22, is accused of firing a single shot from a rooftop overlooking a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, striking the 31-year-old conservative speaker in the neck as he fielded questions from people in the audience in a courtyard at the heart of campus.",
      "Robinson was not seen in court on Monday and spoke only in response to a question from the judge at the start of the hearing.",
      "Graf addressed two issues \u2014 whether transcripts from the sealed hearing earlier this year should be made public and the extent of access the media and public should have to the case going forward.",
      "A group of local and national media outlets, including Fox News, have filed a motion for limited intervention. Lawyers for the group asked Graf for formal recognition from the court, advance notice of attempts to seal future hearings or otherwise limit access to the courtroom, including by banning cameras, and to give the media time to oppose such restrictions.",
      "Read the Oct. 24 transcript here:",
      "He denied the motion, however, cited a prior order telling lawyers for both sides they must notify the media before attempting to have future hearings behind closed doors. The parties are not required to notify the media before potential future attempts to limit cameras or other electronic coverage of the courtroom.",

      "\"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts,\" the family said in a social media post.",
      "Schlossberg wrote in The New Yorker on Nov. 22 that she had acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3. She was diagnosed on May 25, 2024, when she gave birth to her second child and a doctor noticed her abnormally high white blood cell count and ordered further tests, she wrote.",
      "She then spent five weeks at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York before beginning chemotherapy at home and later receiving a bone marrow transplant.",
      "\"During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\" she wrote. \"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn\u2019t remember me.\"",
      "She was the daughter of artist Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy, the eldest child of John F. Kennedy.",
      "Tatiana Schlossberg was an experienced and respected environmental journalist, having worked for The New York Times and contributed to publications such as The Atlantic and The Washington Post. Her book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have,\" was published in 2019.",
      "For one story, she completed a 30-mile, 7-hour cross-country ski race in Wisconsin.",
      "Schlossberg wrote movingly about the psychological toll of dealing with terminal illness while raising a young family.",
      "\"Maybe my brain is replaying my life now because I have a terminal diagnosis, and all these memories will be lost. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have much time to make new ones, and some part of me is sifting through the sands,\" she said.",
      "In her essay, she reflected on the disbelief she felt upon hearing the news, given her healthy, active lifestyle \u2014 the day before giving birth, she had swum a mile in a pool.",
      "But in her latest clinical trial, her doctor said he \"could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Schlossberg also criticized her cousin, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, whom she said was \"an embarrassment to me and the rest of my family\" when he ran for president as an independent candidate in 2024.",
      "As he was being confirmed to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, she was undergoing a clinical trial for CAR T-cell therapy.",
      "\"I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,\" she wrote.",
      "She added that, given Kennedy's skepticism of vaccines and his public doubt over their safety, Schlossberg worried that, now that she was severely immunocompromised and needed to retake her childhood vaccines, she may not be able to access them."

    "summary": "The Republican-led Congress had a busy first year of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in 2025, passing tax cuts in the \"big beautiful bill\" and more.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Republican-led Congress had a busy first year of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in 2025.",
      "From approving Trump\u2019s signature tax-cut and spending legislation to repealing a record number of regulations under a fast-track procedure, the actions taken on Capitol Hill this year will have an impact on just about every American.",
      "It was also a dramatic year, with the party\u2019s narrow House majority fighting bitterly among itself and Congress struggling to achieve bipartisan deals to pass funding bills, leading to a record 43-day shutdown last fall.",
      "Here are four big things Congress did in 2025.",
      "Made Trump\u2019s tax cuts permanent",
      "Republican leaders made good on their top priority of extending the Trump tax cuts, which passed in 2017 and were set to expire at the end of this year. The \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d \u2014 as Trump dubbed it \u2014 passed both chambers with only Republican votes and was signed into law on July 4.",
      "\u201cAmerica\u2019s winning, winning, winning like never before,\u201d Trump said before enacting it. \u201cWe have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent.\u201d",
      "Trump also touted other provisions, including a tax deduction for tipped workers, a tax break for tipped workers, a deduction for seniors and tax-advantaged \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d for newborns.",
      "The law is projected to slash taxes by $4.5 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. While the tax extensions affected all levels of income earners, Democrats noted that a disproportionate share of the tax benefits go to the highest earners.",
      "Trillion-dollar Pentagon and mass deportations",
      "Also significant are the spending provisions in the massive law.",
      "It contains a $150 billion infusion for the Pentagon \u2014 which, alongside the $900 billion in spending approved under the annual National Defense Authorization Act \u2014 gives the U.S. military its first budget topping $1 trillion.",
      "In addition, the legislation authorized more than $170 billion for immigration enforcement to hire ICE agents, conduct raids and carry out mass deportations, a cornerstone of Trump's agenda.",
      "Democrats have focused their criticism on the bill\u2019s $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, included to help reduce the red ink. The law also slashes clean energy funding that Democrats passed in 2022.",
      "Repealed a record number of regulations",
      "This year, Republican leaders aggressively used a 1996 law known as the Congressional Review Act to fast-track repeal of a record number of federal regulations imposed under the Biden administration, spanning consumer protection and education to energy and cybersecurity.",
      "In 2025, Congress passed 22 \u201cCRA\u201d resolutions that Trump signed into law, according to the American Action Forum, a conservative group tracking the issue. That\u2019s more than the 20 rules repealed through CRA resolutions in the entire history of the law prior to 2025.",
      "Unlike most bills, the CRA measures are exempt from the 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate, so Democrats were largely powerless to stop the GOP\u2019s 53-member Senate majority.",
      "Weakened minority power in the Senate",
      "Senate Republicans made several consequential moves this year to limit the minority\u2019s power to obstruct or slow down business.",
      "In September, they used the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to change Senate rules and allow presidential nominations for executive branch positions to be confirmed \u201cen bloc\u201d \u2014 one vote to confirm an unlimited number of nominees, dispensing with the requirement to debate and process each one individually. That month, Republicans confirmed a package of 48 nominees. Before adjourning for the year, they confirmed another 97 nominees.",
      "In addition, this Senate majority has expanded the scope of what the chamber can do with 51 votes \u2014 by establishing a new budget baseline to slap a $0 price tag on $3.4 trillion in party-line tax cuts, and by ignoring the parliamentarian\u2019s opinion about limitations on what can be repealed under the CRA process.",
      "Despite these moves, the 60-vote threshold remains intact for most other legislation, as Republican leaders have resisted Trump's demands to abolish what's left of the filibuster."

      "Grammy-winning singer Chappell Roan has backtracked on her praise for Brigitte Bardot after learning about the late French film icon's \"very disappointing\" far-right political beliefs.",
      "\"Holy (expletive) i did not know all that insane (expletive) Ms. Bardot stood for,\" Roan wrote Monday in a post on her Instagram Stories.",
      "Bardot, an international sex symbol who starred in Roger Vadim's \"And God Created Woman\" and Jean-Luc Godard's \"Contempt,\" gravitated toward the French far-right in her later years.",
      "She was repeatedly fined for inciting racial hatred against Muslim immigrants to France, according to news reports. In her 1996 memoir, she declared her support for far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Le Pen's advisers included Bernard d'Ormale, Bardot's fourth husband.",
      "\"I do not condone this,\" Roan wrote in her Instagram post, adding that it had been \"very disappointing to learn\" about Bardot's political beliefs. Roan did not specify which views she found objectionable.",
      "Roan, 27, name-dropped Bardot on her 2023 single \"Red Wine Supernova,\" which opens with the rhyming lyric: \"She was a playboy, Brigitte Bardot / She showed me things I didn't know.\"",
      "After Bardot died on Sunday, Roan initially paid her respects on Instagram. \"Rest in peace Ms. Bardot,\" the singer wrote. \"She was my inspiration for red wine supernova.\"",
      "French political figures across the ideological spectrum eulogized Bardot in statements after her death. French President Emmanuel Macron said she \"embodied a life of freedom.\"",
      "Jordan Bardella, the president of the far-right National Rally party, a successor to the National Front, hailed her as a \"passionate patriot\" who symbolized \"an entire era of French history.\"",
      "Bardot was a committed advocate for animal rights and launched a foundation devoted to their protection. She lobbied for animal welfare legislation and helped secure convictions against perpetrators of animal abuse.",
      "Bruno Jacquelin, a representative of Bardot's foundation, told The Associated Press that she died at her home in southern France. She was 91. Jacquelin did not provide a cause of death, adding that arrangements have yet been made for funeral or memorial services.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/gold-silver-prices-soar-rcna251490",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:14:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Gold and silver prices are about to record their biggest annual gains since 1979",
    "story": [
      "Gold and silver prices are about to record their biggest annual gains since 1979.",
      "Rising sharply in late April after President Donald Trump\u2019s rocky global tariff rollout, the price of gold has soared nearly 70% in 2025. Silver, up more than 30% in December alone, has surged more than 160% this year.",
      "While there are a few factors at play, the rally can trace its origins to the unease over volatile trade policies announced by the Trump administration earlier this year, as well as a concern that they could weaken the U.S. dollar and hurt its appeal around the world. Often referred to as \u201csafe haven\u201d assets, precious metals rise when investors move out of more volatile assets, like stocks.",
      "In contrast to precious metals, the U.S. dollar\u2019s value has declined more than 9% in 2025, as compared to a basket of other major currencies such as the euro and yen.",
      "Gold in particular rose this year as \u201ccentral banks and investors embraced the precious metal\u2019s qualities as a non-sovereign asset,\u201d according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets.",
      "\u201cThe broader economic environment continues to provide multiple factors that historically have influenced gold price movements,\u201d they said in a Dec. 22 note.",
      "Central banks around the world, which buy gold as a safe and secure asset to fill their reserves, have been net buyers of the metal for months, according to the World Gold Council. In October, the most recent data available, central banks ramped up their buying even more, adding 53 tons of gold to their reserves. Big purchases can potentially restrict the available gold supply, thus driving up its overall price.",
      "After Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cliberation day\u201d in early April, traders and some of the largest banks flew stocks of the metals to the U.S. in order to front-run the newly imposed array of tariffs. That\u2019s because the City of London serves as the world\u2019s primary clearing point for gold and other major precious metals. In recent years, New York City has also added many vaults, where some of the metals rushed in before the first wave of this year\u2019s tariffs likely remain today.",
      "Silver, meanwhile, is a key component in electrical circuits and switches, as well as electric vehicles and solar energy products. Gold differs because it is historically much less volatile than silver, so it\u2019s widely used as a long-term store of value and a way to diversify an investment portfolio.",
      "Silver\u2019s meteoric rise briefly sputtered after Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on X on Dec. 26 that the soaring silver prices are \u201cnot good.\u201d",
      "\u201cSilver is needed in many industrial processes,\u201d Musk added in the post.",
      "Still, in the days since, silver resumed rising despite a drop of more than 8% on Monday. As of midday Tuesday, it was up 10%. Unlike gold, whose price is currently more than $4,300 per ounce, silver is trading at a much lower $77, making it more susceptible to volatility and retail trading.",
      "Gold also fell on Monday by more than 4% before a slight rebound Tuesday. \u201cProfit taking and reported progress on a Ukraine peace deal could be significant catalysts in the downside move,\u201d said Chris Waterbury, derivatives manager at Charles Schwab.",
      "On Monday, Trump held a face-to-face meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine regarding the state of the war Russia is waging on Ukrainian territory. Both leaders sounded an optimistic tone after the talks, with Zelenskyy telling reporters in a news conference that the talks were \u201cgreat.\u201d",
      "The most well-known gold ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol \u201cGLD,\u201d has recorded more than $20 billion of inflows from investors this year. One of the most well-known silver ETFs, which trades as \u201cSLV,\u201d has recorded almost $3.5 billion of inflows this year. Those funds are typically how average investors take part in the precious metals trade.",
      "Gold ETFs overall experienced five straight months of investor inflows through November, according to the World Gold Council, which operates the \u201cGLD\u201d ETF."

Next up, she\u2019ll take on the challenge of starring in the West End production of \u201cDracula,\u201d where she will portray 23 different roles.",
      "Ahead of preparing for the show to premiere next year, Erivo spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about her busy schedule over the past few years and how she has preserved her voice.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always taking care of it,\u201d Erivo told the publication. She also shared that she is constantly in contact with vocal coaches Joan Lader and Antea Birchett and performs warmup exercises before all her performances.",

Someone made a meme of the mug that I carry around because I have it with me everywhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have it in several different colors.

The musical, adapted and written by Kip Williams, will run from Feb. 4 to May 30, 2026 at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre. It is described as an \u201cintoxicating, blood-pumping reimagining of the immortal gothic horror.\u201d",
      "Speaking about the demanding role, Erivo said, \u201cMy head is so full of information. It\u2019s not just the words, it\u2019s just not just the characters, it\u2019s the movement on stage with these characters, and the changes that happen on the stage with these characters. Costume changes are happening in real time in front of you; the character\u2019s becoming another character with a beat where there is no costume change; I\u2019m putting teeth in at the same time.\u201d",
      "Even though the actor has mastered many performances on the screen and stage, she said the show will be a new experience for her.",
      "\u201cThis is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before, and my brain is definitely being stretched to its limit,\u201d she shared.",
      "But, she said she knows when to say \u201cno\u201d if her constant schedule becomes too much.",
      "\u201cIf it feels like (an opportunity) might be something that I\u2019m going to have to learn from \u2014 this is really scary, this is going to force me to find something else in my character, something else in who I am \u2014 then I say yes,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe problem is a lot of those things are showing up right now, so I\u2019m not saying no very often, but I do say no.\u201d",
      "In addition to her West End run, Erivo is also expected to be highlighted during the upcoming award season. She already scored a nomination for best film female actor \u2014 musical or comedy at the 83rd annual Golden Globe Awards, airing Jan. 11, for her portrayal of Elphaba in \u201cWicked: For Good.\u201d"

      "\u201cAnytime you have double letters, it\u2019s a little bit harder,\u201d Zoe Bell, executive producer of games at The New York Times, said on TODAY Dec. 29. \u201cAnd, then, if it\u2019s double letters, and it\u2019s a vowel, I think it\u2019s even harder. And then it\u2019s an \u2018O,\u2019 which is a weird vowel. And they were split up. They weren\u2019t in the middle, so it just made it really hard.\u201d",
      "Bell, who said there was an average of 46 Wordle scores shared per second, said her strategy is to start with a different word each day (much like Pope Leo says he does).",
      "While many players choose to begin with \"ADIEU,\" due to all the vowels, that may not be the wisest play.",
      "\u201cIt is not the best Wordle word to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cWe actually have a Wordle analysis tool called Robot and it suggests 'TROPE' or 'TRACE' might be better words, and end up with you getting a lower score overall.\u201d",
      "Bell also said it\u2019s important not to overlook the value of the second word players guess.",
      "\u201cYou can have a great first word and eliminate a bunch of possible options. And then if you just screw it up and guess duplicate letters later on, you\u2019ve ruined your chances. We\u2019ve done an analysis on this \u2014 the combination of your first word and responsive second word to what you learned in the first word.\u201d",

      "\u201cA moment of listening, a word of comfort, a friendly conversation, a helping hand, presence, these simple acts of care might seem small,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut they contribute to the beautiful tapestry of life to which we all belong.\u201d",
      "As scenes of people coming together and celebrating the holiday appear on the screen, Kate shares how Christmas is a time that reminds people how \u201cdeeply our lives are woven together.\u201d",

      "\u201c(We're) keeping them busy with sports and just being outdoors is really important. They\u2019re trying to learn musical instruments. I\u2019m not sure how successful we\u2019re being with that,\u201d he told host Eugene Levy.",

      "\"And we\u2019re a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us and things that trouble us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you never quite know the knock-on effects it can have.

      "Iran is facing its largest demonstrations in years as people hit the streets of Tehran and other cities to protest the country's dismal economic situation.",
      "The protests erupted Sunday and gathered pace Monday after the Islamic Republic\u2019s currency, the rial, hit a record low against the dollar. Many in Iran are already struggling with the cost of living, and rising prices have fueled concerns about potential hyperinflation.",
      "In Tehran, shopkeepers protested near the city\u2019s central bazaar, reminiscent of the Iranian revolution in 1979 when merchants played a key role by shuttering their shops and protesting against the reigning monarch at the time.",
      "While the underlying reasons for the protests are economic, video geolocated by NBC News that circulated online Sunday showed crowds chanting against the country\u2019s ruling clerics. NBC News was not able to establish when the footage was dated to.",
      "A photo from the state-run Fars news agency showed tear gas being fired, though Iran's president urged authorities to listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters. The embattled head of the central bank, Mohammad Reza Farzin, resigned Monday, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.",
      "The Iranian rial crashed to 1.42 million to the dollar on Sunday and was being traded for 1.38 million to the dollar on Monday. The dramatic drop in the value of the currency has led to families struggling to make ends meet as the value of their savings has plunged, analysts say.",
      "According to the state statistics center, the inflation rate in December rose to 42.2% from the same period last year and is 1.8% higher than in November. Food prices rose 72% and health and medical items were up 50% from December last year, according to the statistics center. Many critics see the rate as a sign of approaching hyperinflation.",
      "\u201cPeople feel that they are left alone, that the leadership doesn\u2019t care about them,\u201d Omid Memarian, a senior Iran analyst at Dawn, a Washington-based nonprofit promoting human rights in the Middle East, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t know what to do and the sanctions are biting and the pressure is just mounting by the day,\u201d said Memarian, a prominent critic of the Iranian government who previously worked at the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran.",
      "The protests began among shopkeepers and traders in Tehran, with state media reporting that many stores around the Grand Bazaar were closed Monday as hundreds gathered.",
      "The currency drop and fluctuating prices saw traders selling imported goods particularly affected.",
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian acknowledged the country\u2019s deep economic woes in a message posted to X on Monday. He said he had instructed the minister of interior to meet with representatives from the protesters in order to hear their concerns and try to solve their problems.",

      "Qalibaf also accused Iran's enemies of seeking to exploit the protests.",
      "Authorities announced a shutdown would take place Wednesday in Tehran and a number of other provinces across the country, citing cold weather and the need to maintain energy supplies.",
      "The demonstrations appeared to be the largest in the Islamic Republic since the Woman, Life, Freedom protests in 2022 and 2023, which posed a serious challenge to the Iranian government and only dwindled after a harsh crackdown from security forces that led to the death of some 500 people and the arrest of thousands.",
      "\u201cWhile these protests have a different trigger than the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom uprising \u2014 sparked by the murder of Mahsa Jina Amini at the hands of the so-called morality police\u2014the core grievances remain the same: systemic mismanagement, corruption, and repression,\u201d Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in a text message response to questions. \u201cFor Iranians, as long as the Islamic Republic remains in power, their problems cannot be solved.\u201d",
      "Iran's economy has been battered by years of sanctions and a 12-day war with Israel last June \u2014 when the U.S. military also attacked the country's nuclear facilities \u2014 left the country reeling.",
      "\"After the war, there was a sense that there would be a huge opening up, but you\u2019re seeing actually the leadership of Iran has become even more hard line and people don\u2019t see any path toward getting out of the ditch that they are in now,\" said Memarian."

      "At the shelter\u2019s site in Deir al-Balah, several dogs with three legs are among the animals running around, a stark reminder of the toll that the war has taken. In a large tent, veterinarians and volunteers work together to place an IV into the leg of a small, whimpering puppy.",

During the worst aid shortages, the team shared scarce rice, pasta and canned tuna with the animals, a desperate measure to prevent starvation.",
      "Since the war erupted in October 2023, Gaza\u2019s animal population has plummeted. According to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor, an estimated 97% of the strip\u2019s livestock has been destroyed through bombing, starvation and looting. This includes cows, sheep, goats and poultry.",
      "Large animals like donkeys and horses have dropped to around 30% of their former numbers.",
      "Stray pets have not been spared; countless dogs and cats were abandoned as families fled, leading to a surge in malnutrition, diseases like parvovirus, anemia and respiratory infections. Veterinary reports describe animals in states of \u201ccachexia\u201d \u2014 severe wasting \u2014 with weakened immune systems exacerbating outbreaks of gastroenteritis, jaundice and eye diseases. Sulala\u2019s clinic treats these conditions daily.",
      "\u201cPeople seek comfort in animals. Some find support in dogs, while others find it in cats. During the war, I witnessed many individuals caring for and sheltering animals, both cats and dogs. They reached out to us, and we consistently provided them with food,\u201d Al-Aar told NBC News.",
      "The Sulala Animal Rescue team worked in dire and dangerous conditions as Israel continued its assault on Gaza. Famine conditions in Gaza City have eased since the ceasefire began in October, according to a report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading authority on food crises, but the situation remains critical, with the entire strip still at risk of starvation.",
      "Veterinarian Muath Talat Abo Rokba, who worked with Sulala and also ran his own veterinary clinic, was reportedly killed by Israeli forces in October, while the ceasefire was in effect. He had been visiting the ruins of his home in the Jabalia area, close to the \u201cyellow line\u201d marking Israeli-held territory, Sulala Animal Rescue said at the time. The IDF told NBC News that it was not aware of the specific incident.",
      "\u201cThere are no words we have about losing him,\u201d said Annelies Keuleers, a remote volunteer and spokesperson for Sulala Animal Rescue. \u201cIn many ways, he was absolutely irreplaceable.\u201d",

She\u2019d spent six years tracking the man authorities believed was responsible for killing her daughter, a search that spanned thousands of miles, international borders and dozens of possible sightings that, in the end, had produced little.",
      "Wentzel declined to identify the message\u2019s sender, but she said it supposedly contained a recent picture of Raymond McLeod, who at the time was one of the U.S. Marshals Service\u2019s most wanted fugitives. Had he actually been found \u2014 or would this be another jolt of false hope?",
      "She focused in on the image, she said, and \u201cjust freaked out like, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s him. I didn\u2019t even want to think it because someone might hear my thoughts and warn him to flee.\u201d",
      "McLeod, a 42-year-old former U.S. Marine, was apprehended in El Salvador days later and is awaiting trial in San Diego on a charge of first-degree murder in the June 2016 strangulation of Krystal Mitchell. He pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for a preliminary hearing in March. His attorneys either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. In court filings, they said McLeod accidentally killed Mitchell during \u201crough, consensual sex gone wrong.\u201d",
      "Wentzel, a 67-year-old grandmother and former police detective had been preparing for life as an RV'ing snowbird when her daughter was killed. She has used the improbable platform she developed pursuing McLeod to write two books \u2014 \u201cThe Chase\u201d and \u201cThe Capture\u201d \u2014 and to help other grieving parents navigate the mix of frustration, despair and confusion left by an unsolved homicide.",
      "Wentzel has assisted a nonprofit that helps law enforcement agencies with a series of cases in recent years, including the disappearance and alleged murder of Maya Millete, according to the Cold Case Foundation\u2019s co-executive director. Through a nonprofit Wentzel established, Angels of Justice, she launched a campaign urging the White House to treat the country\u2019s massive backlog of unsolved murders as a national emergency.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokeswoman blamed former President Joe Biden for failing to enable law enforcement agencies to \u201ctruly fight crime\u201d and said that President Donald Trump is \u201crestoring integrity to our justice system.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Marshals Service, which apprehended McLeod, declined to comment on questions about Wentzel\u2019s role in finding him, but in a statement after McLeod\u2019s capture the agency\u2019s director said Wentzel had worked \u201cdiligently with law enforcement these past years to see this day of justice arrive.\u201d",
      "The San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office has said she was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the search for McLeod.",
      "\u201cShe goes for it,\u201d said Pat Kuiper, who credits Wentzel with helping push investigators in Washington state to take another look at the nearly two-decade-old unsolved murder of her son. \u201cShe goes for it in such a way that people can\u2019t really refuse her, because she\u2019s so genuine and kind, but persistent, assertive.\u201d",
      "For Rachel Glass, whose daughter was found strangled along with her pregnant roommate in Arizona 15 years ago, Wentzel provided an empathetic ear and insight into an investigative process that Glass \u2014 a longtime nurse \u2014 knew nothing about.",
      "\u201cIf there are things that go on and you think, what the hell is this, I\u2019d call her and say, you won\u2019t believe what\u2019s happened now,\u201d Glass recalled. \u201cAnd she might tell me x, y and z about why it has to play out like that.\u201d",

      "A deadly date in San Diego",
      "For Wentzel, that chapter began soon after the death of her daughter. According to a statement of facts filed by the San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office, McLeod had gotten into a fight at a San Diego bar June 9, 2016, after he grabbed Mitchell by the throat and a man intervened, telling him to stop.",
      "Mitchell was found dead the next day at the apartment where they were staying. According to the statement, a deputy medical examiner determined she had been strangled and later compared the severity of the injury to someone who\u2019d been struck with a baseball bat or had their neck stomped on.",
      "Mitchell, 30, had been visiting the city with McLeod from Phoenix, where the divorced mother of two worked as a property manager, Wentzel said. To her mother, Mitchell was the life of the party \u2014 and someone who turned heads whenever she walked into a room.",
      "Mitchell met McLeod through work a few weeks before \u2014 he\u2019d gone to her office to rent an apartment, her mother said \u2014 and they\u2019d traveled to San Diego. Mitchell was impressed by how much McLeod seemed to care for his young son, Wentzel said, and she didn\u2019t appear to know about his previous allegations of domestic violence.",
      "One of those alleged incidents occurred not long before their trip, court records in California show. In Riverside County, he was charged that April with inflicting corporal injury on a spouse \u2014 an alleged crime that involved accusations that he strangled his wife, according to the statement of facts.",
      "McLeod pleaded not guilty, the Riverside County records show, and in a filing his lawyers in Mitchell\u2019s case have said that he has a \u201chistory of consensual sexual practices that included elements of the BDSM community such as bondage, whipping, slapping, choking and erotic asphyxiation, sometimes to unconsciousness.\u201d",
      "That earlier case was not adjudicated, however, and McLeod disappeared after Mitchell\u2019s death. According to prosecutors, on June 10, he allegedly drove Mitchell\u2019s car to San Diego International Airport, where he rented another car and headed to Mexico.",
      "An international search",
      "The San Diego Police Department identified McLeod as a person of interest in Mitchell\u2019s death almost immediately. A warrant seeking his arrest in her murder was filed June 13.",
      "But McLeod was nowhere to be found. Eventually, Wentzel recalled, the Marshals Service got involved and offered a reward. But she became frustrated with the government\u2019s inability to quickly investigate leads in foreign countries, she said. U.S. embassies seemed less than enthusiastic about helping, she said, and she recalled a deputy marshal telling her that they couldn\u2019t just \u201crun in and get the guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s another country,\u201d she recalled him saying. \u201cWe got to get approval.\u201d",
      "The Marshals Service declined to comment. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "So Wentzel began searching herself. Although she\u2019d worked for several years as a police officer and detective in her native Guam decades ago, she said that experience didn\u2019t begin to prepare her for the years of social media sleuthing that she was about to embark on.",
      "One of her first steps was to pull together a \u201cwanted\u201d poster with pictures of McLeod, along with a brief description of the slaying and the reward amount \u2014 at the time $5,000, she said. She focused on Belize, a place she\u2019d heard he might be, and circulated information among dozens of Facebook accounts \u2014 gyms and resorts, restaurants and a university, screenshots of the messages show.",
      "After posting the information to a buy/sell group, Wentzel recalled, the responses started rolling in. Some were by phone. Others came via WhatsApp or Facebook.",
      "\u201cMadam I saw this man I am sure of it from his tattoos and his face,\u201d one message read, according to a screenshot.",
      "\u201cIf he is here he will b caught,\u201d read another.",
      "But then, he wasn\u2019t. And the messages continued. There were tips that he was in Honduras, that he was in Guatemala. Some tipsters seemed to legitimately want to help, she said. Others seemed like scammers.",
      "\u201cOne guy contacted me and said, OK, he\u2019s here,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI know where he\u2019s working at. I\u2019ve got pictures. I\u2019ve got all this. So, you know, I need you to send me $1,000.\u201d",
      "There were so many tips, said Mike Wentzel, that fielding them became a 24/7 job for his wife. At times, he considered asking her to dial things back, but never could.",
      "\u201cThis is her child,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can I tell her to stop?\u201d",
      "But there were times when the thought crossed her mind. Keeping hope alive during the pandemic, when that steady flow of tips dried up, was especially difficult, she said.",
      "The final tip",
      "As this slump in information dragged on, Wentzel said, local and federal officials announced that McLeod had been added to the Marshals\u2019 list of its 15 most wanted fugitives. In the spring 2021 announcement, they also announced that the reward for information leading to McLeod\u2019s arrest had grown to $50,000.",
      "His last known location was in Guatemala in 2017, the officials said.",
      "Wentzel said she believes it was a tip linked to that Central American country that ultimately led to McLeod\u2019s capture. Five years after he was spotted in Guatemala, she said, a couple of tipsters told her they\u2019d seen McLeod at a hotel just north of the country\u2019s border with El Salvador.",
      "Wentzel surveyed YouTube videos from the hotel to see if she could spot his face, she recalled, and she posted a \u201cwanted\u201d ad on Facebook that targeted accounts in the area. Wentzel said she set a 100-mile radius for the ad, meaning that everyone in that zone would see McLeod\u2019s face.",
      "Eventually, Wentzel said, she learned from the Marshals Service that someone saw one of her ads and shared a brochure with authorities that appeared to show McLeod. The brochure was from a Salvadoran English school not far from the Guatemalan hotel, she said.",
      "It was this image that prompted Wentzel to conclude: \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d",
      "Four days later, on Aug. 30, 2022, authorities announced that McLeod had been taken into custody in Sonsonate, El Salvador, where he\u2019d been teaching English. He landed in San Diego the next day.",
      "Wentzel wrestled with a tangle of emotion as McLeod\u2019s arraignment approached. She thought about her daughter\u2019s final moments and ticked through a litany of revenge fantasies, she recalled. But she didn\u2019t want to stew in hatred and bitterness. So she tried to focus on her daughter\u2019s children, whom she and her husband have raised, and on the other victims she\u2019s sought to help.",
      "\u201cMurder does this to you \u2014 it makes you somebody you\u2019re not, if you allow it,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t picture living my life out like this. I wanted to be a grandma and I just wanted to travel and have fun and live the rest of my life out with my family. But it made me something else.\u201d"

      "Trump also said Hamas would have \u201chell to pay\u201d if it didn\u2019t disarm to advance the U.S.-brokered peace plan, as he seeks to move into its second phase. He said Hamas, which didn\u2019t agree to the demilitarization of Gaza that Trump laid out as a key point in his peace plan, will be given a \"very short period of time\" to disarm.",
      "If it doesn't, Trump said, the consequences will be \"horrible.\" He suggested that other countries \u2014 not necessarily the U.S. or Israel \u2014 would take action against the perpetrators of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were abducted.",

      "Standing alongside him at the top of the meeting, Netanyahu praised Trump.",
      "\"I'll say it again and again and again, we\u2019ve never had a friend like President Trump in the White House. It\u2019s not even close,\" he said. \"And I think you can judge that by not merely by the frequency of our meetings, but by the content and the intensity.\"",
      "Trump responded: \"Well, I just want to say that it\u2019s very important who the prime minister and president of Israel is. We have a great relationship.",
      "\"He can be very difficult on occasion, but you need a strong man,\" Trump added. \"If you had a weak man, you wouldn\u2019t have Israel right now. Israel would have been, you know, Israel, with most other leaders, would not exist today.\"",
      "Netanyahu reiterated his praise of Trump after their meeting, announcing that Israel would award him the Israel Prize, the country's highest honor. Netanyahu said it would be the first time the prize has been awarded to a non-Israeli.",

      "While Trump has been working for an end to the war in Europe, progress in the Middle East has stalled.",
      "The Israel-Hamas truce went into effect in October, ending the two-year conflict in Gaza that followed the Oct. 7 Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "But there has been little movement on the more complex second phase of the peace process, raising concerns that both sides are failing to take action to carry out the next phase.",

      "The U.N. Security Council gave its approval to Phase 2 of Trump\u2019s 20-point peace plan last month, under which Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and Hamas would give up its weapons.",

      "The mystery set off the largest underwater search in history, along with multiple conspiracy theories.",
      "Over the years, only a few dozen pieces of suspected debris have washed up on Indian Ocean islands and the African coast. No human remains or large portions of wreckage have been found, though every person on board is presumed dead.",
      "In 2014, the governments of Australia, Malaysia and China conducted the largest and most expensive underwater search in aviation history, mapping a 46,000-square-mile area in the southern Indian Ocean floor that is roughly the size of the state of Ohio. The operation ended in 2017 without finding much.",

      "Eight months ago, a White House meeting in February ended in acrimony and failed to produce the breakthrough Trump had promised on \u201cday one\u201d of his administration.",
      "European leaders flanked Zelenskyy on his next visit to the White House in August as they grappled for a voice in the faltering negotiations, but Europe has since remained largely shut out of high-level talks as Russia refuses to budge from its maximalist demands.",
      "There now appear to be signals from the Ukrainian camp that Kyiv may be prepared to compromise with Moscow.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday in a Telegram post that \u201cmuch can be decided before the New Year,\u201d but \u201cwhether decisions will be made depends on our partners.\u201d",
      "Last week, he outlined elements of an updated proposal that would see Ukraine potentially withdraw troops from parts of the east without recognizing captured areas as Russian territory, with a demilitarized zone established in their place.",
      "Such suggestions had previously appeared to be red lines in peace talks. Until Tuesday, Zelenskyy had maintained that he would be unwilling to withdraw troops from the country\u2019s eastern industrial heartland, much of which has been occupied by Russian forces, as part of any plan to end the war.",
      "But he has remained firm on another issue.",
      "Zelenskyy said the question of U.S.-backed security guarantees for Ukraine, aimed at preventing further Russian incursions, would ultimately depend on the U.S. president.",
      "\u201cFor us, it is very important that there is a signal that we want legally binding security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy told Ukrainian journalists in a Q&A session via WhatsApp on Saturday. \u201cThis primarily depends on President Trump. The question is what security guarantees President Trump is ready to provide to Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That said, Ukraine\u2019s history underscores the dangers of relying on security assurances as a long-term solution. The Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994 in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear weapons, committed the U.S. and Russia to respecting Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "It was shattered in 2014 with Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and incursions in eastern Ukraine, followed by the full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago, which sparked the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II.",
      "It remains unclear whether Zelenskyy\u2019s optimism is widely shared. He presented a united front with European leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney after meetings on Saturday, though there was little sign of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said countries would work toward a \u201cshared objective,\u201d divisions have blown up in recent weeks over since-dropped plans to hand seized Russian assets to Ukraine.",
      "And it\u2019s unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin, and even Trump himself, will ultimately respond to Zelenskyy\u2019s latest peace offerings.",
      "Putin told some of Russia\u2019s top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine, but that he wanted full control of the Donbas region, the Kommersant newspaper reported on Friday.",
      "\u201cVladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that \u2018Donbas is ours,\u2019\u201d Kommersant reported. In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas, though outside that area \u201ca partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out,\u201d wrote columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.",
      "Such hard-line demands, held by Putin throughout the conflict, still appear well at odds with Zelenskyy\u2019s pathway to peace.",
      "While demilitarized zones remain a possibility, Zelenskyy said Ukraine and the United States have not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas it still controls.",
      "After heavy Russian strikes hit Kyiv across the weekend, killing two and injuring dozens more, Zelenskyy said Saturday that Putin is not interested in peace, accusing him of seeking to prolong the war and \u201cuse every opportunity to cause Ukraine even greater suffering.\u201d",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has remained publicly noncommittal. Asked about Zelenskyy\u2019s visit, he told Politico: \u201cWe will see what he\u2019s got.\u201d",
      "A Ukrainian official familiar with the planning for Sunday\u2019s meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump told NBC News that in addition to security guarantees for Ukraine, the Ukrainians are preparing to discuss economic prosperity and reconstruction of the war-torn country.",
      "There are also talks of holding a joint news conference with Trump and Zelenskyy, not necessarily to announce anything new, but to discuss the results of the meeting, the Ukrainian official said.",
      "Still, expectations persist that there will be something new for the duo to say Sunday, after years of deadlock and over a million dead.",
      "From a European and Ukrainian perspective, \u201cwhat we\u2019re talking about now has much more substance than it used to,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy has clearly demonstrated his willingness to compromise, to come to a sort of an agreement, especially when there\u2019s perspective for future stability with U.S. security guarantees,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cThe big question remains, is Russia really willing to concede or to agree to an honest peace plan on terms that are also acceptable to Ukraine?\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is something we cannot see at the current moment,\u201d he added."

      "Screen siren Brigitte Bardot, whose portrayals of free-spirited ingenues made her an international sex symbol and the pride of France, and who turned her back on movie stardom in 1973 to become an animal rights activist, has died, according to French media and The Associated Press.",
      "She was 91.",
      "Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals, told The Associated Press that she died at her home in southern France. He did not provide a cause of death, and said no arrangements have yet been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalized last month after a period of ill health.",
      "Leading tributes, French President Emmanuel Macron said Bardot \u201cembodied a life of freedom\u201d and lived a \u201cFrench existence.\u201d Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally party, which Bardot publicly supported in her later years, referred to her as a \u201cpassionate patriot\u201d who represented \u201can entire era of French history.\u201d",
      "Bardot\u2019s foundation paid tribute to her legacy on animal rights, from traveling to Arctic ice floes to help baby seals, to lobbying for animal welfare legislation and securing convictions for perpetrators of animal abuse.",
      "Her death comes two months after she underwent what her staff, described in a statement to AFP as \u201cminor surgery\u201d for an unspecified ailment in October.",
      "At the time, Bardot quickly swatted away false online reports that she had died.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know which imbecile launched this fake news regarding my disappearance, but know that I\u2019m fine and have no intention of bowing out,\u201d she had posted on X.",
      "But a month later, in November 2025, Bardot was hospitalized again for what French news outlets described a \u201cserious\u201d health issue.",
      "Born a brunette on Sept. 28, 1934, in Paris, Bardot became world famous after she dyed her hair blond and starred in the 1956 movie \u201cAnd God Created Woman,\u201d which was directed by her first husband, Roger Vadim.",
      "The provocative French melodrama about a voluptuous teenager who scandalizes Saint-Tropez was a box office smash both abroad and in the United States, despite mixed critical reviews and condemnation by watchdog groups like the National Legion of Decency.",
      "Dubbed a \u201csex kitten\u201d by British film producer Tony Tenser, Bardot broke through as the so-called sexual revolution was underway, women were embracing birth control, and many moviegoers were searching for racier fare.",
      "French feminist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir called her a \u201clocomotive of women\u2019s history\u201d and \u201cthe most liberated woman in post-war France\u201d in a 1959 essay titled \u201cBrigitte Bardot and the Lolita Syndrome.\u201d",
      "French President Charles de Gaulle declared that Bardot was a \u201cFrench export as important as Renault cars.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, BB, as the French affectionately called her, went on to appear in more than 40 movies, including a handful of Hollywood productions, before retiring from acting at age 39.",
      "But before she retreated to her estate on the French Riviera to lead a far more reclusive life, Bardot bared it all in the pages of Playboy to mark her 40th birthday.",
      "And soon she was championing a new cause.",
      "\u201cI gave my youth and my beauty to men,\u201d Bardot later said, \u201cbut I give my wisdom and experience to animals.\u201d",
      "Bardot appealed to the Danish queen to halt the mass killings of dolphins in the Faroe Islands.",
      "Bardot became a hero to animal rights activists. And in 1985, when France awarded her the Legion of Honor medal, Bardot insisted it was for her work to save animals \u2014 not for her movies.",
      "\u201cI take this Legion of Honor for my fight in favor of animals,\u201d Bardot declared.",
      "In 1986, the former actor founded the Brigitte Bardot Foundation and harnessed her fame to lead campaigns against, among other things, the eating of horse meat and the hunting of turtle doves in France.",
      "In her later years, Bardot gravitated to far-right politics and was fined repeatedly for inciting racial hatred against Muslim immigrants to France, according to news reports.",
      "In her 1996 memoir, Bardot outraged many fans by declaring her support for far-right National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen. Her fourth husband, businessman Bernard d\u2019Ormale, had been an adviser to Le Pen.",
      "In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \u201chypocritical,\u201d because many played \u201cthe teases\u201d with producers to land parts.",
      "She said she had never been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \u201ccharming to be told that I was beautiful.\u201d",
      "The Nazis were occupying Paris when Bardot was growing up in a luxurious seven-bedroom apartment and dreaming of becoming a ballerina.",
      "Raised by conservative Catholic parents, Bardot chafed against her upbringing. But she was allowed to take dance classes. And in 1950 she landed, at age 15, on the cover of Elle magazine after the editor spotted her at a train station.",
      "That led to a movie audition the next year, where Bardot met Vadim, who was 24 at the time.",
      "Despite the age difference, they fell in love. And over her parents\u2019 objections, Bardot and Vadim married on Dec. 21, 1952, three months after her 18th birthday.",
      "Bardot embarked on a movie career that, early on, included a small part in the 1953 Hollywood production \u201cAct of Love,\u201d starring Kirk Douglas.",
      "Three years later, while shooting an Italian movie called \u201cMio figlio Nerone,\u201d Bardot dyed her hair blond at the urging of the director and turbocharged her career.",
      "Bardot was box office gold and even won critical acclaim for her turns in internationally produced movies like \u201cThe Truth\u201d (1960) and \u201cViva Maria!\u201d (1965). But she mostly steered clear of Hollywood, although she did play herself in the 1965 comedy \u201cDear Brigitte.\u201d",
      "Bardot did not think much of her own acting.",
      "\u201cI started out as a lousy actress and have remained one,\u201d she reportedly said, according to The Guardian.",
      "Bardot also recorded some 60 pop songs in the 1960s and 1970s, many of them in collaboration with French singer Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she had an affair while married to her third husband, German millionaire Gunter Sachs.",
      "One of Bardot\u2019s best-known musical forays was a cover of Stevie Wonder\u2019s \u201cYou Are the Sunshine of My Life\u201d with French singer Sacha Distel.",
      "By her own admission, Bardot\u2019s personal life was tempestuous.",
      "Her marriage to Vadim began falling apart on the set of \u201cAnd God Created Woman\u201d when she embarked on an affair with her co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant.",
      "It was one of many infidelities that Bardot has admitted to over the years.",
      "Two years later, Bardot married actor Jacques Charrier, with whom she had her only child \u2014 a son named Nicolas-Jacques Charrier, who was born in January 1960.",
      "Bardot, in her memoir, wrote that she was \u201cnot made to be a mother.\u201d She wrote that her unborn child was like a \u201ccancerous tumor\u201d that she tried to remove by punching herself in the stomach.",
      "When that marriage broke up after three years, Charrier got custody of their son.",
      "Father and son later sued Bardot for the \u201churtful remarks\u201d in the memoir and were awarded $36,200 in damages.",
      "Bardot and her son, who lives in Norway, later reconciled. And she met her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.",
      "Her three-year marriage to Sachs in 1966 was also marked by multiple infidelities, but it ended in an amicable divorce.",
      "\u201cA year with Bardot was worth 10 with anyone else,\u201d Sachs reportedly said after the marriage was over.",
      "Bardot, in public statements, rarely revisited her acting career once it was over. In a 2007 interview, she appeared to be at a loss when asked how she came to be an icon of French cinema.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that I arrived and left at the right time. My wild and free side unsettled some, and unwedged others.\u201d"

      "Musk said back in 2022 that he supported the law, but began to change with the fine against X \u2014 the first under the new legal powers \u2014 which he called \"bulls---.\" He has also referred to Breton as a \"tyrant of Europe,\" while Rubio and JD Vance both condemned the fine.",

Rogers, the under secretary of state, called Ahmed a \u201ckey collaborator with the Biden administration\u2019s effort to weaponize the government against U.S. citizens\u201d and noted that CCDH had previously put out a report that named now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as part of the \"disinformation dozen.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Ahmed, a U.S. permanent resident, filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials over the sanctions. On Thursday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that forbade law enforcement from arresting or detaining Ahmed before his case is heard.",
      "Next on the list was Clare Melford, head of the Global Disinformation Index, a nonprofit organization based in the United Kingdom that tries to tackle disinformation.

The White House has portrayed its actions as necessary to break the decadeslong liberal bias held by media and government elites, while for critics, it is an attempt to silence dissent and promote illiberal, often hate, speech online.",
      "Last month, many in Europe were aghast when Trump\u2019s national security strategy railed against the E.U. for undermining \u201cpolitical liberty and sovereignty,\u201d adopting \u201cmigration policies that are transforming the continent,\u201d and \u201ccreating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.\u201d"

      "On the side of a dusty road in Gaza, dozens of mostly young men gather against the counter of a makeshift storefront. Under a canvas roof, the acrylic display cases are filled with boxes of high-end cellphones.",
      "It is a surreal spectacle: Palestinians, many displaced from their bombed-out homes, malnourished, sick and jobless in this collapsed economy, being sold the recently released iPhone 17 Pro. Even budget phones have been selling for as much as 5,000 shekels \u2014 around $1,500 \u2014 according to customers in Gaza, where prices have spiked to 10 times those in other countries.",
      "That such luxury items are in supply, but often food or medicine is still scarce, is exasperating aid workers and Palestinians. Experts interviewed for this story said Israel\u2019s border controls often make commercial goods easier to transport than humanitarian aid. Though the flow has increased during the shaky ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the United Nations and other groups say they are still facing serious restrictions on urgent items.",
      "\u201cWe cannot even afford food \u2014 how are we supposed to afford phones?\u201d asked Samir Kamal Awad Abou Dakaa, 52, who was a construction worker before the war and has a wife and five children to feed.",

His faded blue track jacket, thinning hair and quiet voice betray what he calls a \u201cbeyond difficult\u201d life.",
      "This contrast is not new for Gaza, said Mona Jebril, a research fellow at England\u2019s University of Cambridge who lived in the territory for 22 years. \u201cBefore the war and during the siege, there were mobile phones and expensive cars. But because of the extra restrictions on the borders, the massive devastation and humanitarian catastrophe, then this paradox comes to light even more.\u201d",
      "This is the latest twist in efforts to get aid into Gaza during a patchy ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. While President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan appears to be holding, albeit with regular Israeli airstrikes, the crisis endures.",
      "Nearly all of the population of some 2 million has been displaced, 80% of the buildings have been destroyed or damaged, and 9,000 children were hospitalized for malnutrition in October alone, according to the U.N.",
      "The ceasefire has changed things. Some 65,000 pallets of aid came into Gaza during the first month of the ceasefire, the U.N. said, double the previous four weeks. But essential equipment, such as forklift trucks and mobile storage units, is still being \u201csystematically rejected by Israeli authorities,\u201d the U.N.\u2019s humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said.

      "SYDNEY \u2014 The sense of anger is palpable among members of the Jewish community in and around Bondi Beach as it reels from the attack on a Hanukkah celebration that killed 15 people.",
      "Much of their fury is directed at the government, which has been accused of failing to heed warnings about antisemitic threats ahead of the Dec. 14 attack. But there has also been sadness and soul-searching about the place the community has in a neighborhood well known for its Jewish roots, and in Australia\u2019s wider society.",
      "Linda Royal said her parents fled Poland after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1939, arriving first in Lithuania. They landed in Sydney two years later, aided by illegal transit visas issued by a Japanese diplomat.",
      "\u201cLike many migrants, they came to Bondi because it was working-class and inexpensive,\u201d she told NBC News last week close to the site of the shooting, on a hill where thousands of flowers had been laid in tribute to the victims.",
      "In the years since her parents\u2019 arrival, Royal said, the Jewish community has swelled in the neighborhood and its surrounding suburbs, first with Holocaust survivors and later with refugees known as refuseniks from countries in the former Soviet Union, some of whom had been denied permission to emigrate to Israel.",
      "\u201cThere was a huge sense of community,\u201d Royal said. \u201cThe Jewish community sticks together. We\u2019re constantly unfortunately on the run from persecution.\u201d",
      "Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in decades has \u201ccompletely ripped us apart,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll never be the same again.\u201d",
      "Authorities have identified the two suspects as 24-year-old Naveed Akram and his 50-year-old father, Sajid Akram. The elder Akram was shot dead at the scene, while his son was charged last week with 59 offenses, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after waking up from a coma.",
      "Investigators have said the pair were inspired by the ideology of the Islamic State terrorist group. Two homemade ISIS flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police have said. ISIS has praised but not officially claimed the attack, referring to it in an official publication as \u201cSydney\u2019s pride.\u201d",
      "As well as sadness about the attack, \u201cthere\u2019s a great deal of anger, a great deal of rage,\u201d Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said via phone on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that not only was the writing on the wall, but the community explicitly and repetitively told the government what was going to happen,\u201d said Ryvchin, who was born in Ukraine before he moved to Australia as a child.",
      "The shooting was \u201ca clear escalation from violent slogans and aggressive street protests and abuse of Jews on the streets, to harassment and vandalism of Jewish property and then finally the firebombings,\u201d he said, referring to several arson attacks on synagogues in recent years. This \u201cwas always going to end in murder, and that\u2019s exactly where we are,\u201d he added.",
      "Ryvchin, whose former home was daubed with antisemitic language and cars were set alight earlier this year, said both Australia\u2019s federal government and provincial leaders in the state of New South Wales had failed to act on proposals to curb antisemitic violence.",
      "These included more visible policing and a clampdown on pro-Palestinian protests that had become increasingly aggressive and turned people against the Jewish community, he added.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, whose poll numbers were found by The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper to have plunged by 15 points in the wake of the attack, said Tuesday that his government would address hate speech and gun control and work with states on new laws.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",

      "New South Wales, where Bondi is situated, debated tougher gun laws on Tuesday. The state\u2019s leader is also trying to ban the display of terrorist symbols and curb protests. Other states have indicated they\u2019ll try to follow suit.",
      "But while they were welcomed by some, others were critical of the hasty way the government tried to bring them in. Antony Loewenstein, a journalist and author who serves on the advisory committee of the Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \u201cPalestinian freedom,\u201d said: \u201cI think they\u2019re an absolute abomination.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are rushed, not thought through, and they\u2019re arguably unconstitutional,\u201d he said, adding that he thought they would be challenged in court.",
      "Three activist groups representing those in support of Palestine and Indigenous Australians have said they\u2019ll challenge the proposed laws in Australia\u2019s high court.",
      "Loewenstein also disputed Ryvchin\u2019s claim that pro-Palestinian marches in Australia, some of the largest of which have taken place in Sydney, had incited violence against the Jewish community.",
      "Australia is home to many \u201cprogressive Jews who are deeply against Israel\u2019s mass slaughtering in Gaza\u201d and oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government, Lowenstein said.",
      "\u201cThe truth of the matter is that there is literally no connection that we are aware of between the murderers, these two men, father and son, and the pro-Palestine movement. Zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried and scared, of course, by the direct targeting of Jews but also deeply concerned that our fears are being weaponized in the service of deeply antidemocratic and draconian policies,\u201d he added.",
      "Others like Ryvchin are calling for a Royal Commission, or a major public inquiry into the attack. It is necessary so \u201cJewish people can walk down the street without fear and maybe next year we can get together again, as we have every year, and kindle the Hanukkah flames and hopefully not do it with police snipers on roofs,\u201d he said.",
      "Albanese has so far resisted calls to do this, saying he wants to avoid a drawn-out process and that Royal Commissions haven\u2019t been held after similar incidents.",
      "Whether it takes place or not, back in Bondi, Linda Royal said things would not be the same again.",
      "\u201cWe now associate this place with yet another place of a Jewish massacre, and that can never be taken away,\u201d she said."
