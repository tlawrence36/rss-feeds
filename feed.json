      "Paul McCartney has staged a surprise performance before a small crowd in New York",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Paul McCartney\u2019s previous New York-area performance took place three years ago at MetLife Stadium, capacity 82,500. His surprise show Tuesday night at the Bowery Ballroom fit, at most, 575.",
      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",
      "\u201cWe just got lucky,\u201d Sokoloff said. \u201cI\u2019m always learning about these things the day after.\u201d",
      "McCartney took the stage roughly on time at 6:30 p.m. with his regular band, along with a three-member horn section. They had only rehearsed once, the day before, McCartney said. Someone shouted: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to rehearse!\u201d",
      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",
      "McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary festivities. He\u2019s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.",
      "It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he\u2019s hoping to finish a new album this year.",
      "For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. \u201cSome of us need to get some sleep, you know,\u201d he replied.",
      "McCartney still came back, bouncing on the stage for an encore. He closed with the rousing \u201cAbbey Road\u201d send off of \u201cCarry That Weight\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d concluded with its immortalized final lines: \u201cAnd in the end/ The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\u201d",
      "The crowd, still in disbelief, spilled out into the street. Snow had begun to fall.",

      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",
      "Tacopina said before the trial that Rocky was \u201ceager to tell his story. He would love the opportunity to do so.\u201d",
      "The attorneys could not give comment outside court Monday because a judge has forbidden them from speaking to the media. Rocky faces up to 24 years in prison if convicted, after turning down a pre-trial plea deal that could have led to just 180 days in jail.",
      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",
      "Rocky is a Grammy-nominated hip-hop star, fashion mogul and the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear Tuesday to watch his testimony.",
      "She has shown up sporadically \u2014 most recently on Friday, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, would likely testify that a gun he fired twice \u2014 in a scuffle with a former friend on a Hollywood street corner in 2021 \u2014 was a starter pistol that only fired blanks, and that he carried it for security.",
      "On Monday, his tour manager became the second witness from Rocky's inner circle to testify that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Lou Levin said he told the rapper it made sense to carry it after Rocky's house had been broken into by a stalker and others.",
      "\u201cSecurity and I thought it would be a good idea, because of the prior violence,\" Levin said. \"It\u2019s just a nonlethal form of self-defense.\u201d",
      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",
      "Authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege Rocky used.",
      "Levin testified that an ammunition magazine found in Rocky's house by officers serving a search warrant actually belonged to him.",
      "Lewin, the prosecutor, said \u201cyou had to come up with a story\u201d to explain the magazine. He later called every aspect of the story \u201ca lie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to come up with a story \u2014 it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Levin said."

      "Jackson\u2019s interjections \u2014 labeling parts of the performance \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto\u201d and at one point reminding Lamar to \u201cplay the game\u201d \u2014 were in line with Lamar's stated intent to infuse storytelling into his halftime show and also in line with the Pulitzer Prize winner's history of layering of messages throughout his music.",
      "Other European cities that Lamar and SZA plan to visit include Amsterdam, Paris, London, Rome and Barcelona.",
      "Presales for the shows will begin Wednesday with general admission ticket sales starting on Friday. More information is available at the website www.grandnationaltour.com."

      "NEW YORK -- Former Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin will have a memoir out this fall, looking back on a momentous four years in office when she led an all-female governing coalition, presided over her country's joining NATO and enacted legislation on climate change and social justice.",
      "Scribner announced that Marin's \u201cHope in Action: A Memoir about the Courage to Lead\u201d will be published Nov. 4.",
      "\"The world is increasingly complex. Geopolitical turmoil and rivalry are challenging the rules-based international order.

      "Marin was just 34 when elected in 2019, as part of a center-left coalition that made history by being led entirely by women.

      "At times, her private life made news. In August 2022, she apologized after the publication of a photo that showed two women kissing and posing topless at the prime minister's official summer residence.

      "A brief protest by a performer at Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show referenced Sudan and the Gaza Strip, two wars in the Middle East that have killed tens of thousands",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A performer at Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show unfurled a flag referencing both Sudan and the Gaza Strip, providing a brief protest referencing two wars shaking the Middle East.",
      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "Jon Batiste turned his Super Bowl opportunity into a symphony of artistry, the debut of new music and a tribute to his hometown roots",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste transformed the Super Bowl stage into a symphony of creativity, debuting new music, reimagining \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\" and shining a global spotlight on his wife's creative vision.",
      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media. He's thankful for the collaboration and proud of Jaouad, a writer who is battling cancer for a third time.",
      "In December, she revealed her diagnosis on social media.",
      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",
      "Before delivering the national anthem, Jon Batiste brought his signature energy to New Orleans\u2019 9th Ward, turning a neighborhood into a stage for joy and community.",
      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",
      "\u201cThey greatest thing we can do is serve and not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic view. ... Yes, I\u2019m honored to sing at the Super Bowl. I also want to leave something that impacts the community, my hometown.\u201d",

      "As if there were any doubts of the Pulitzer Prize winning rapper's ability to put on a show.",
      "As dozens of dancers emerged from a Buick GNX clown car style, he launched into an as-yet-untitled new song that had been teased with an online snippet when his \"GNX\" album was released, then moved into \u201cSquabble Up.\" For just under 13 minutes during the halftime show sponsored by Apple Music and Roc Nation, Lamar commanded the field.",
      "Dancers dressed in red, white and blue joined Lamar. But even in their patriotic colors, they were labeled \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d by Jackson's Uncle Sam, who reminded Lamar to \u201cplay the game.\u201d Then, he launched into \u201cHumble.,\u201d \u201cDNA.,\" \u201cEuphoria\" and \u201cman at the garden.\u201d",
      "\u201cScore keeper, deduct one life,\u201d Jackson interrupted again. Lamar launched into \u201cpeakboo,\u201d and then teased a performance of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanna play their favorite song but you know they love to sue,\u201d Lamar told the women dancers behind him, referencing Drake.",
      "It is hard to underscore the ubiquity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u2014 with its billion streams on Spotify, the massive hit is a regional anthem for Los Angeles, a rallying cry for community and against culture vultures, a diss track that won Lamar the highly-publicized feud with Drake and the track that won song and record of the year at the Grammys last weekend.",
      "Leading up to the Super Bowl, whether or not Lamar would perform the song was a legitimate question held by fans and critics alike. Lamar levels strong accusations against Drake in its lyrics; Drake has sued Universal Music Group for defamation as a result of the song's popularity. Does a Super Bowl performance further complicate things?",
      "Little was known about Lamar's halftime performance ahead of time. Lamar promised to keep his passion for storytelling at the forefront of his plans, and SZA was a previously announced guest performer. They are frequent collaborators; she most recently appeared his recent album \u201cGNX\u201d and was featured on a couple songs including \u201cGloria\u201d and \u201cLuther,\u201d which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn through \u201cIf This World Were Mine.\u201d The duo will also co-headline a 19-city North American tour this spring and summer.",

      "\u201cThat's what America wants \u2014 nice and calm,\u201d Jackson said.",

      "He brought out the producer Mustard and tennis superstar Serena Williams was spotted crip walking along to the diss track.",
      "Is there any better publicity than the biggest stage in U.S. sports? Consider this just another step in Lamar's continued victory lap.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having previously performed at the NFL\u2019s championship game in 2022 as a guest artist, alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem.",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",

      "NEW YORK -- On a quiet winter weekend at the box office, DreamWorks Animation\u2019s \u201cDog Man\u201d chased its own tail, repeating as the top movie in theaters.",
      "The animated Universal Pictures release, adapted from Dav Pilkey\u2019s popular graphic novel series, collected $13.7 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Both new releases \u2013 the Ke Huy Quan action movie \u201cLove Hurts\u201d and the Valentine\u2019s Day-themed slasher \u201cHeart Eyes\u201d \u2013 were left nipping at the heels of \u201cDog Man.\u201d",
      "Hollywood often largely punts Super Bowl weekend to the small screen. Last year, Apple\u2019s much-derided \u201cArgylle\u201d debuted on the same weekend. Instead, the movie industry spends more energy pitching its blockbusters in trailers for the huge football audience on TV.",
      "It wasn\u2019t a banner weekend for \u201cDog Man.\u201d It fell steeply, dropping 62% in it second weekend. But with a production budget of $40 million, \u201cDog Man\u201d has already tallied $54.1 million domestically in two weeks.",
      "Coming in second was Spyglass Media Group\u2019s \u201cHeart Eyes,\u201d released by Sony. The horror-rom-com mashup earned $8.5 million from 3,102 locations. Reviews have been good for the film, directed by Josh Ruben and starring Oliva Holt and Mason Gooding, though audiences were less impressed. Moviegoers gave it a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore. Spyglass made \u201cHeart Eyes\u201d for $18 million.",
      "\u201cLove Hurts,\u201d the action comedy from 87North Productions (\u201cJohn Wick,\u201d \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d), debuted with a paltry $5.8 million in 3,055 theaters. In his first big movie role since his Oscar-winning comeback in \u201cEverything All at Once,\u201d Ke Huy Quan stars as a mild-mannered realtor with a hitman past. Ariana DeBose co-stars. It, too, was modestly budgeted at $18 million. Audiences, however, mostly rejected the movie, giving \u201cLove Hurts\u201d a \u201cC+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Next weekend should bring Hollywood its biggest box-office weekend of the year with the release of Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World\u201d and Sony\u2019s \u201cPaddington in Peru.\u201d",

      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",

      "Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.",
      "The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.",
      "The guild also named RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys\" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.",
      "Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.",
      "Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d cleaned up with nine awards including best film. \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards."

      "Dog folk often call the Westminster Kennel Club show the Super Bowl of canine competitions",
      "NEW YORK -- They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship.",
      "Sorry \u2014 no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.",
      "Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.",
      "\u201cI always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl \u2018the Westminster of football,\u2019 \u201d quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.",
      "And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster\u2019s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)",
      "Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.",
      "\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d be here. And now we\u2019re here,\u201d Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.",
      "A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 350 champion-level contestants in one of dogdom's most popular sports.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s very intuitive, very natural -- probably smarter than me,\u201d handler Emily Klarman told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.",
      "A sizeable, black-and-white dog named Gable won a special award for the best mixed-breed competitor.",
      "Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillion mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.",
      "She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.",
      "His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.",
      "\u201cHe's always exciting \u2014 he does ridiculous things,\u201d she said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs Saturday. \u201cWe have fun, regardless what happens.\u201d",
      "While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly-Labradoodle mix, used to be \u201cafraid of the world\u201d but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.",
      "Saturday's canine competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a seven-pound (0.9-kg) papillion, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.",
      "They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.",
      "Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.",
      "Westminster\u2019s traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.",
      "That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.",
      "Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl \u2014 because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.",
      "There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of organized chaos,\u201d Hillary Brown said with a chuckle after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break are a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.",
      "\u201cIt's a blast. The dogs love it,\u201d Brown said.",

      "\u201cI was lucky enough to get in on the last years of the Golden Age of Broadway. In that era there was a lot more going on that seemed to have high quality about it and great conviction,\u201d he told Broadway World in 2015.",

      "The exhibit, \u201cColor in Motion: Chromatic Explorations of Cinema,\u201d running through July 13, is timely not only because everything Oz is new again.",
      "It also highlights the largely unsung role that women played in the development of color in Hollywood, not only on screen but off, where labor-intensive jobs like hand-coloring and stenciling gave them a foothold in a male-dominated industry.",
      "There's also a fanciful interactive installation where your own body creates cinematic explosions of color, on the spot.",
      "Here are some highlights:",
      "Those glistening slippers nestled against a wall \u2014 rather unobtrusively, given their iconic status \u2014 began their life as white silk pumps. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d costume designer Adrian (known by his first name) dyed them red and embellished them with nearly 5,000 sequins.",
      "One of four known pairs used for the film that still exist, they were secured with great fanfare and help from luminaries like Leonardo DiCaprio, and were displayed when the museum opened in September 2021.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the biggest treasures we have in our collection,\u201d says Jessica Niebel, curator of the color show. \u201cEver since they came down, we\u2019ve gotten regular visitor feedback asking to see the ruby red slippers back on display. This was the perfect opportunity.\u201d",
      "The shoes are silver in both Baum\u2019s 1900 novel and in Gregory Maguire's 1995 book \u201cWicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\u201d on which the Broadway show and movie are based.",
      "Some nine years after \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d another movie put a pair of red shoes front and center. They were ballet pointe shoes, and the film, fittingly, was \u201cThe Red Shoes.\u201d",
      "The sad story of a young ballerina forced to choose between her career and a romance, the movie , by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, starred Moira Shearer, a real-life ballerina. Its tragic 17-minute dance sequence tells a story within a story \u2014 a young woman who dances in the red shoes until she dies.",
      "Curators placed these prized red pointe shoes front and center because, Niebel says, \u201cThe Red Shoes\u201d highlights both the magical nature of red and the role color plays in the expression of physical movement through dance.",
      "Poignantly, the pointe shoes are not perfect, but worn \u2014 just as the character\u2019s white dress turns gray and dirty as she is gradually consumed.",
      "Silent films were in black and white, right?",
      "Well, no, actually. In this gallery, silent film excerpts show that many were in color. \u201cIn the 1920s, most films, 80-90%, we think, were in color,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cThey only became black and white with the arrival of sound.\u201d",
      "Before that, the majority of films where were tinted and toned, curators say, meaning an entire filmstrip is submerged in one color, often a bright one like yellow or pink or red or blue.",
      "Curators went to four film archives in Europe and the U.S. and scanned their filmstrips. \u201cIn this gallery, for the first time, you can see how these colors authentically looked in the 1920s without any digital manipulation,\u201d Niebel says.",
      "Another section describes a phenomenon many know nothing about: leader ladies. These were women who appeared in the lead frame of a film reel to be processed in a color lab. They were invisible to audiences, but used to calibrate and process the color in a film.",
      "The display raises the issue that this process, which has disappeared with the digital age, largely excluded people of color.",
      "\u201cPredominantly they used to be white women,\u201d Niebel says. \u201cSo film stock and film materials were calibrated towards white skin predominantly. We wanted to tell this story as well \u2014 the story of these women who are never named, who the public never saw, but also the story of how film stock was developed particularly to depict white skin.\u201d",
      "The show begins with images of Lo\u00efe Fuller and the Serpentine Dance she invented, where colored light was reflected onto a flowing costume, changing the colors. An American dancer, Fuller experimented in the early 20th century with fabric, movement, and color techniques like gels and chemical salts.",
      "But many other women toiled in obscurity. There were, for example, the women at Disney, as the studio made a transition to color. We learn that under the leadership of Walt Disney's sister-in-law Hazel Sewell, the studio's ink and paint department became the animation industry\u2019s first all-female unit.",
      "And the French production company Path\u00e9 employed young women to hand-paint films \u2014 frame by frame \u2014 early in the 20th century. These young women earned less than their male counterparts. Still, it was more than they were able to earn in other professions.",
      "As kids know from finger painting, there\u2019s nothing more fun than making color yourself \u2014 especially color that moves. That\u2019s the takeaway from a final gallery in which your own physical movement creates cascades of color.",
      "\u201cBody Paint,\u201d by artist Memo Akten, allows you to stand in front of a screen, spread your arms, jump up and down or move any which way you want as a camera translates the moves into color.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time for visitors to become animators of colors themselves through their own bodies,\u201d Niebel says. She's seen people stop and perform full-on dances at the installation.",
      "\u201cIt seems to bring people together,\u201d she says."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky 's lawyers will make their case and try to establish a counternarrative Friday at his trial in Los Angeles, where the hip-hop star and fashion mogul is charged with firing a gun at a former friend on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "They plan to call to the stand rapper A$AP Twelvyy, who, like both the defendant and the man he's charged with shooting, was a member of the A$AP Mob, a group of young artists and creators that formed at a New York high school nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Twelvyy was one of two members of the crew who accompanied Rocky to a meetup with A$AP Relli, with whom he had a long-simmering beef that came to a head, he said, when Rocky fired a gun at him.",
      "Twelvyy is expected to testify that Rocky fired a starter pistol that only shoots blanks, which he carries as a prop for security. The defense contends that the phony gun answers many questions about the case, including why Relli only had grazed knuckles and no other injuries.",
      "The potentially confusing set of \u201cA$AP\u201d names have become familiar to people in the courtroom, and most likely the jury, through the approximately three days of Relli's testimony, which makes up the bulk of prosecutors' case, rested on Thursday.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, and if convicted on both, he can legally get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of their toddler sons, slipped into the courtroom Thursday afternoon and sat in Rocky\u2019s section after several days of absence. She had her hair up and wore glasses with a tan trenchcoat on a rainy day in LA.",
      "The defense has not said whether Rocky will take the considerable risk of going on the stand himself, which he is not legally required to do. He already opted to take a significant risk by turning down the prosecution's pre-trial offer of a recommended sentence of just 180 days in jail and other relatively minor penalties in exchange for a guilty plea on one count.",

      "The defense has already brought one witness it was allowed to call early, an internet branding consultant who worked with both Rocky and Relli. He recorded phone calls, purportedly with Relli saying his main intention was to get millions from Rocky, and the criminal case didn't matter.",

      "It's a happy homecoming for the United States' most prestigious canine event, which moved to venues outside Manhattan in recent years because of the coronavirus pandemic and then other considerations. But organizers longed to return to the self-described World\u2019s Most Famous Arena.",
      "\u201cIf you love dogs and you want to see the very best dogs from all around the world competing for the top prize of best in show at Westminster, just be there,\u201d club President Donald Sturz said. For fans who can't be there in person, Fox Sports is showing the event's various components on FS1 and FS2 and streaming some on the network's website and app; Westminster is streaming some others. The competition spans Saturday, Monday and Tuesday, with best in show awarded around 11 p.m. Tuesday on the East Coast.",
      "Might Mercedes, the German shepherd who was Westminster\u2019s runner-up last year, become top dog this time? Or could this be the year for Monty the giant schnauzer, who was a Westminster finalist the last two years, won the American Kennel Club\u2019s big show in December and is currently the sport's top-ranked dog? Will the prize go to another high-ranking dog \u2014 or a dark horse?",
      "Here are the basics on Westminster and the dog show world it epitomizes.",
      "It begins Saturday morning at the Javits Center convention hall with agility and obedience championships and some demonstration events, including Westminster's first experiment with flyball. That's essentially a canine relay race that involves running a course of jumps and retrieving a ball.",
      "The traditional, breed-by-breed judging \u2014 what show folk call \u201cconformation\u201d \u2014 unfolds Monday and Tuesday. First-round competition, where dogs are judged against others of their breed, happens during the daytime at the Javits Center. Then, in what are essentially semifinals, each breed winner is judged against others within its \u201cgroup\u201d of dozens of breeds at Madison Square Garden in the evenings. In the final round, the seven group winners compete for best in show Tuesday night.",
      "At each level, judges decide which dog in the ring best matches the ideal, or \u201cstandard,\u201d for its own breed.",
      "About 2,500 dogs from 201 breeds and varieties (subsets of breeds) are signed up to compete.",
      "Hailing from every U.S. state and 12 other countries, contestants include such familiar breeds as golden retrievers and such rarities as sloughis. No doodles, though. At least for now, those poodle mixes aren't recognized as purebreds by the American Kennel Club, the governing body for Westminster and many other U.S. dog shows.",
      "Dachshunds are the best-represented breed, with 52 entered.",
      "The agility and obedience contests involve a few hundred more dogs, including mixed-breed ones. Last year a border collie-papillion combination named Nimble became the first mixed-breed winner in the agility trial\u2019s decade-long history.",
      "First, breeders determine which puppies are physically and temperamentally suited for showing. Those pups are raised, trained and groomed to put their best paw forward in the show ring. \u201cBeginner puppies\u201d can start competing in AKC shows at 4 months.",
      "Some owners exhibit their own dogs where and when they can. Others have professional handlers who crisscross the country to compete most weekends, sometimes with multiple pooches.",
      "Trying for a national ranking is known as \u201ccampaigning\u201d a dog, and no wonder. As in politics, hopefuls \u2014 or, here, their owners and handlers \u2014 may gather intel about rivals\u2019 plans and either seek or avoid a face-off. They may weigh a particular judge's record. Some even run full-page ads in dog magazines to congratulate, salute and promote their animals.",
      "All Westminster dogs are champions, as measured by their sport's complicated point system. But yes, there are stats, kept by the Canine Chronicle magazine.",
      "Besides Monty and Mercedes, entrants include Vito, a pug who won the National Dog Show televised Thanksgiving Day, along with 2024 Westminster semifinalists Comet the shih tzu and Louis the Afghan hound. There's a high-ranking otterhound, representing one of the country's rarer breeds, and a big-winning wire fox terrier, whose breed won more than any other at Westminster.",
      "Still, show cognoscenti often say victory goes to \u201cthe dog on the day,\u201d meaning the one that has the performance of a lifetime.",
      "And regardless which dog the judge chooses, others sometimes win the audience's heart. Among the crowd faves over the years: a Sussex spaniel who sat up straight on his hind legs before the judge; a treat-seeking Leonberger who gnawed at his handler\u2019s pocket while going around the ring; and a shiba inu shown by a 10-year-old girl.",
      "Wire fox terriers have taken the top prize 15 times, most recently in 2019. Poodles of various sizes have 11 wins. A miniature poodle named Sage won last year.",
      "Many breeds haven't won yet, including such favorites as the French bulldog and Labrador retriever. But never say never: Two of the last three winners have been firsts for their breeds: the petit basset griffon Vend\u00e9en and the bloodhound.",
      "Bragging rights, ribbons and trophies. There are no cash prizes, though the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 Westminster donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "Animal rights activists routinely protest outside, and sometimes inside, the show. During last year's final round, someone carrying a sign reading \u201cboycott breeders\u201d tried to climb into the ring. The demonstrator was quickly intercepted and arrested.",

      "Federal government payments for subscriptions to media outlets have become the latest target of President Donald Trump's spending hawks",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal government payments to news outlets like Politico, The New York Times and The Associated Press for subscriptions or to license content are in the crosshairs of Trump administration spending hawks, with the president on Thursday calling it potentially \u201cTHE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest in a series of skirmishes with the media, long a target of Donald Trump and his supporters. The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",
      "This time, though, is a bit different. By linking federal government spending to the media, Trump has bundled two of his long-favored political targets into one rhetorical package \u2014 denouncing a common practice as untoward while offering no supporting evidence for his assertions.",
      "On Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the government had paid more than $8 million for Politico subscriptions and that Elon Musk's government efficiency team \u201cis working on canceling those payments.\u201d That quickly set off a social-media maelstrom and a hunt by online sleuths for other evidence of taxpayer spending on the news.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government must stop paying for media subscriptions. Now,\u201d Richard Grenell, Trump's special mission envoy, posted on X.",
      "Trump, on his Truth Social platform, complained about payments to the \u201cFAKE NEWS MEDIA\u201d for creating good stories about Democrats. \u201cDid the New York Times receive money??? Who else did??? THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SCANDAL OF THEM ALL,\u201d he wrote.",
      "And at a national prayer breakfast at the Capitol on Thursday morning, Trump touted the efforts to look into the media spending. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them left and right,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re catching them. We\u2019re catching them to a point where they don\u2019t know what the heck is going on. They can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting caught.\u201d",
      "Politico, in a statement to readers from CEO Goli Sheikholeslami and Editor-in-Chief John Harris, said Thursday that it is not getting a government subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt is a transaction \u2014 just as the government buys research, equipment, software and industry reports,\" they said. \"Some online voices are deliberately spreading falsehoods. Let's be clear: Politico has no financial dependence on the government and no hidden agenda. We cover politics and policy \u2014 that's our job.\"",
      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues. The U.S. State Department, for example, may depend on international news reporting for clarity on incidents happening in countries where the United States has interests. Specialists in an agency like the Department of Transportation follow trade publications for industry trends.",
      "The Politico Pro service helps government and private sector customers \"track policy, legislation and regulations in real time with news, intelligence and a suite of data products,\" the company said. It would not discuss how many subscriptions it has sold, or the prices.",
      "The New York Times said it earned less than $2 million last year through government subscriptions, which are offered at a discounted rate. Through one arrangement, the Times gives access to more than 1 million active and retired military members and their families.",
      "\u201cThese officials and other public servants are simply seeking to better understand the world through our independent journalism, like millions of other Americans,\u201d spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said.",
      "Musk, also a frequent critic of the mainstream media and the owner of a platform that in many ways competes with it, retweeted one message on X that complained about the AP \u201craking in millions of dollars in government money for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot for long,\" Musk added. \u201dThis is obviously a huge waste of taxpayer money.\"",
      "AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said that \u201cthe U.S. government has long been an AP customer \u2014 through both Democratic and Republican administrations. It licenses AP's nonpartisan journalism, just like thousands of news outlets and customers around the world. It's quite common for governments to have contracts with news organizations for their content.\u201d",
      "The outlet would not reveal how much it is earning in federal government contracts.",
      "Separately, Musk's focus on the USAID agency has threatened some $268 million in congressionally-authorized funding aimed at offering training and support to some 6,200 independent journalists working around the world, including in war-torn Ukraine, said the organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "Denying the money \u201cwill create a vacuum that plays into the hands of propagandists and authoritarian states,\u201d said Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders' USA branch.",

      "The nurse who died had first sought treatment in Kampala and later traveled to Mbale, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said that the man also sought the services of a traditional healer. His relatives are among those being treated for Ebola.",
      "Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million, and officials are still investigating the source of the outbreak.",
      "Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",

      "Scientists suspect that the first person infected in an Ebola outbreak acquires the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat. Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:10:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state&rsquo;s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
    "story": [
      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",
      "Reached by phone, South Carolina Rep. Luke Rankin, a Republican who added his name to a list of bill sponsors last week, said, \u201cI've always been pro-life.\u201d When asked about the provision to allow prosecution of women seeking abortion, he said: \u201cI can't help you there\u201d and declined to answer questions.",

    "story": [
      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations\u2019 climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century.\"",
      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "GeneDx is targeting a big market for its genetic testing: every newborn baby",
      "GeneDx has a big market in mind for its genetic testing: every newborn baby.",
      "The 24-year-old-company wants to make the testing common at birth. The goal: Identify potential diseases or conditions so doctors can begin treating them before symptoms appear in some cases.",
      "GeneDx specializes in whole genome sequencing. That involves looking at about 20,000 genes that make up a genome, the instructions to build and sustain a human.",
      "More common multi-gene panels, in contrast, may look at a couple hundred genes to identify a specific issue like cancer risk.",
      "GeneDx CEO Katherine Stueland likes the potential of newborn testing, but she says her Stamford, Connecticut, company is still studying the idea.",
      "A potential challenge: Insurers would have to embrace the idea of covering the roughly $2,000 tests routinely.",
      "Stueland spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "A: What is really misunderstood about rare diseases is that they\u2019re actually not that rare. One in 10 Americans has a rare disease. Half of them are children.",
      "Epilepsy is actually a constellation of 768 different genes that are associated with (it). It\u2019s really important when you\u2019re seeing a child with a seizure to look at the entirety of the genome to pinpoint whether one of those many genes is causing the disease.",
      "A: Hearing loss, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis. Ultimately, we want to be sequencing every baby at birth and figuring out whether there is a genetic condition that can be diagnosed right away. For some of these conditions, there may be something clinically actionable that can be done that would prevent a symptom from ever arising.",
      "It (currently) takes, on average, six years to diagnose one of these kids. We can provide an accurate diagnosis within weeks, if not days.",
      "A: In the study that we\u2019ve done \u2026 more than 70% of parents have enrolled. We\u2019re not running whole genome sequencing on every single condition. We\u2019ve focused on 450 conditions, all of which are clinically actionable.",
      "We\u2019re not going to be looking at risk-related information where there\u2019s nothing the parent can do. I think that\u2019s part of the reason why we\u2019ve had such a high enrollment rate.",
      "A: That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re only delivering information to say, you know, we\u2019ve diagnosed your child with a form of epilepsy and we\u2019re able to intervene now before your child has a seizure.",

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded the news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffees or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for a siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Black women in the U.S. died at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women around the time of childbirth in 2023, as maternal mortality fell below prepandemic levels overall but racial gaps widened, according to federal health data released Wednesday.",
      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Hispanic women dropped from about 17 to about 12.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Asian Americans fell from about 13 to about 11.",
      "In total, 669 women died in 2023 during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth, the CDC reported. That\u2019s down from 817 deaths in 2022 and 1,205 in 2021, when it was the highest in more than 50 years.",
      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",
      "Also, the federal Medicaid program expanded to cover postpartum care for up to 12 months, instead of just seven weeks. That helped more moms recover and made them healthier for the next time they tried to have a baby, Williams said.",
      "The number of maternal deaths is also tied to the number of pregnancies. U.S. births have been declining, and fewer pregnancies contributes to fewer pregnancy-related deaths, noted Eugene Declercq, a maternal deaths researcher at Boston University.",
      "CDC officials refused an Associated Press request to talk to a report author.",
      "The government is still receiving and processing death reports from last year. But Declercq said his analysis of available data suggests the number of 2024 maternal deaths may end up about the same as 2023.",

      "In fact, Medicaid plans generally do not have premiums, or if they do, under federal law they must be kept low based on income.",
      "",
      "Asked by Cassidy what reforms he would propose, Kennedy replied, \"Well, I don't have a proposal for dismantling the program.\" He later gave vague responses to Cassidy's question about how he would improve programs for dual eligibles, some 12 million beneficiaries  --  often with complex health issues  --  who are eligible for Medicare but because of their low income, are also eligible for Medicaid.",
      "",
      "\"Well, dual eligibles are not right now served very well into the system,\" Kennedy replied. \"And you know I suppose my answer to that is to make sure that the programs are consolidated, they're integrated, and the care is integrated. I look forward to working with you, Dr. Cassidy, on making sure that we take good care of people.\"",
      "",
      "Cassidy then asked how he proposed to integrate the programs. \"Does Medicare pay more? Medicare pay less? Medicaid pay more? Medicaid pay less? How do we do that?\"",
      "",
      "\"I'm not exactly sure, because I'm not in there. I mean, it is difficult to integrate them ...\" he replied, ultimately saying, \"I do not know the answer to that. I look forward to exploring options.\"",

      "Kennedy also said that Medicare beneficiaries would \"rather be on Medicare Advantage because it offers very good services. People can't afford it. It's much more expensive.\"",
      "",
      "In fact, MA plan beneficiaries generally pay no or very low premiums and choose their plans because of low or non-existent upfront costs. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare  --  $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.",
      "",
      "At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is \"fully paid for by the federal government,\" when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. That's an important concept to understand, since each Medicaid program's coverage and eligibility requirements can vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs run by HHS agencies.",
      "",
      "The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees.",

      "\"... [H]e demonstrated that he did not have a lot of health experience, and in many of his answers, we saw that he has a ... dearth of management experience,\" said Georges Benjamin, MD, executive director of APHA.",

      "Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be \"rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges.\"",
      "",
      "\"He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with,\" Benjamin said. Also, \"he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true.\"",

Some organizations like the Patent and Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",

Lawrence Gostin, JD, a professor at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C., said Kennedy has \"extensive power\" to reorganize the federal workforce, but it isn't unlimited.",
      "",
      "He may get some help from Trump, who issued an executive order to reclassify certain federal employee positions in a way that would make it easier to fire them at will, Gostin said. This order seeks to restore a 2020 executive order, which Biden rescinded in January 2021.",

      "In April, the Office of Personnel Management under President Biden issued a final rule to prohibit this type of reclassification.

      "At an anti-vaccine conference in 2023, Kennedy, who was still running as an independent candidate for president, said he would tell NIH scientists, \"Thank you for [your] public service. We're going to give infectious disease a break for about 8 years.\" Later, in a September 2024 editorial for the Wall Street Journal, in which he endorsed Trump for president, Kennedy suggested that half of the NIH's budget should be directed to \"preventative, alternative, and holistic approaches to health.\"",
      "",
      "Gostin said, as HHS secretary, Kennedy will have \"certain flexibility\" to allocate where research dollars are spent, but at NIH in particular, Congress funds certain centers and programs. So, \"without congressional action to readjust those financial flows, he's going to have relatively limited ability to make the kind of radical changes that he wants to see,\" he noted.",
      "",

      "Paul Offit, MD, a former member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at CDC and a current member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, noted that if the FDA's vaccine advisory committee recommends a vaccine be licensed and the FDA agrees, the HHS secretary could disagree. \"He can say, 'I think this vaccine hasn't been tested well enough,'\" or even that existing vaccines have not been tested enough.",
      "",
      "Kennedy has previously made such arguments. In 2021, he lobbied the FDA to revoke the authorization of the COVID vaccines, even while thousands of people were dying weekly from the virus. In recent months, however, Kennedy has appeared to moderate his stance, telling Republican senators that he won't take away vaccines and that he just wants to make safety and efficacy data more readily available.",
      "",
      "But Offit noted that Kennedy still believes vaccines cause autism despite \"abundant evidence\" that they do not. \"When he says ... 'I just care about vaccine safety,' what he really means is he wants to see studies done to confirm his immutable, fixed, science-resistant beliefs,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Donald Berwick, MD, president emeritus of the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Boston and a former CMS administrator under President Obama, noted that to change vaccination policies reflected in CDC regulations, an HHS secretary would have to follow the rule-making process and provide a 30- or 60-day comment period under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "",
      "\"You can always ignore the law, but when you're a public official ... you've taken an oath, and violating that oath has consequences,\" Berwick said, adding that there needs to be enforcement of those consequences.",

      "Jha noted that as HHS secretary, Kennedy would yield \"soft power\" over the heads of other agencies, including CMS, FDA, NIH, and CDC. \"They're not going to want to make decisions that are going to upset him,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Gostin argued that making vaccine bans the \"holy grail\" of an anti-vaccine agenda is flawed, given the many ways Kennedy, as HHS secretary, could potentially undermine trust in immunizations. Although he has the power to reverse an approval, Kennedy might hesitate to do so given the \"enormous\" backlash he could face, and likely would instead undermine vaccines in other ways  --  such as by appointing vaccine skeptics to advisory committees such as ACIP, he said.",
      "",
      "Balla pointed out that there are stipulations in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) that govern how these committees are constituted and operate. When there's an opening, usually a call is issued in the Federal Register and an open application process follows. Balla also noted that a share of seats are reserved for certain stakeholders to ensure committees are balanced.",
      "",
      "In the \"bad old days\" before FACA, Balla said, committees would hold non-public meetings and be stacked with certain types of stakeholders. The balance and solicitation requirements seek to prevent that. \"So, that makes it harder to, just by fiat, change the composition of the advisory committee,\" he noted.",
      "",
      "Still, as Gostin pointed out, the CDC director makes nominations for the advisory committees, and appointments are ultimately determined by the HHS secretary. And Kennedy, by leveraging anti-vaccine allies on these committees, could ensure that even approved vaccines would not receive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "",
      "\"Even more insidiously,\" he added, \"he could cherry-pick data, [and] use misleading health communications to foment doubt and distrust in certain vaccines,\" and \"a number of red states\" would likely change their school immunization requirements as a result.",
      "",
      "Additional Checks and Balances",
      "",
      "Other forces could limit Kennedy's plans, but for Offit, Congress is unlikely to be one of them. \"The mere fact that they might confirm him tells you that you should worry about them ever pushing back\" on his actions, he said.",
      "",
      "Kennedy's confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, and he has a hearing with the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on Thursday.",
      "",
      "For Jha, one check on Kennedy's power is the sheer number of rules that government officials have to follow. \"It's hard to make reform inside government ... You can do window dressing, but substantive reform is very, very hard, and I don't know that [Kennedy has] got the team or the capability or the patience to do it,\" he said. Plus, if he's not careful, lawsuits will inevitably follow, he added.",
      "",
      "\"The truth is that I think the biggest bulwark against really egregious behavior is likely to come from the courts,\" Jha said. \"I think at least for the next 2 years ... if anybody is doing anything, it's going to be the courts.\"",

      "",
      "Agencies are supposed to terminate all DEIA-related offices and positions, as well as programs, grants, and contracts, within 60 days, according to the executive order.",
      "",
      "The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) followed up with a memo to agency leaders that was shared with MedPage Today, outlining \"steps to close agency DEIA offices.\"",
      "",
      "Agency directors were given a deadline of 5 p.m. ET last Wednesday to let all their staffers know about the closure, and to have colleagues come clean if they noticed any \"coded or imprecise language\" that would serve to \"disguise\" DEIA initiatives.",
      "",
      "The memo included a template that agency heads could use to send to their employees, which HHS used in an email to employees shared with MedPage Today. HHS used the template almost verbatim, including the part about coded language, noting there would be \"no adverse consequences for timely reporting this information. However, failure to report this information within 10 days may result in adverse consequences.\"",
      "",
      "The email also included the template's line about DEIA initiatives: \"These programs divided Americans by race, wasted taxpayer dollars, and resulted in shameful discrimination.\"",
      "",
      "OPM's memo also called on agency heads to notify all employees of DEIA offices that they were being placed on paid administrative leave immediately, and that they would have to take down all \"outward facing media,\" specifically calling out websites and social media.",
      "",
      "Finally, by Jan. 31, OPM wants from all agency directors a \"written plan for executing a reduction-in-force action regarding the employees who work in a DEI office.\"",
      "",
      "Even if it's not clear as to whether the HHS health equity offices will be shuttered, DEIA language was scrubbed from some agency websites. STAT reported that it found 10 examples of pages related to DEIA on FDA's website that had been removed. This included a page for the equity initiative at the Oncology Center of Excellence, and the Office of Equity and Innovative Development in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Other missing pages also included a draft guidance on clinical trial diversity and a podcast on health equity, STAT reported.",
      "",
      "The National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also scrubbed language on DEI goals from some mission statements, and the NIH removed websites related to sexual and gender minority health, STAT noted.",
      "",
      "Meanwhile, the Department of Veterans Affairs boasted in a press release on Monday that it placed almost 60 DEIA employees on administrative leave, saving the agency more than $8 million in combined annual salary. It also identified DEIA-related contracts totaling more than $6.1 million that it's working to cancel."

      "The unidentified doctor, who was part of a nursing service\u2019s palliative care team, was initially suspected of killing four patients in June and July and then attempting, with mixed success, to set fire to their apartments.

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian hospital is examining patient records after a nurse claimed online to have killed Israelis, officials said Wednesday, stressing that no evidence of harm to patients was uncovered.",
      "The claim appears to have been the latest in a surge antisemitic attacks and rhetoric that have roiled Australia as homes, offices and businesses have been vandalised and a school and two synagogues were torched in just over a year with crimes targeting Jews.",
      "A police strike force, established to focus on the antisemitic crimes in Sydney since the Israel-Hamas war began in 2023, was investigating potential offenses stemming from the online video, including breaches of hate speech law, New South Wales state Health Minister Ryan Park said.",
      "Hate crime officials in Sydney and Melbourne \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest cities where 85% of Australia\u2019s Jewish population lives \u2014 are separately investigating the discovery of a trailer containing explosives, a list of potential Jewish targets and arson attacks on two synagogues.",
      "Two nurses who took part in an online discussion with Israeli influencer Max Veifer during a night shift on Tuesday at Sydney\u2019s Bankstown Hospital were suspended on Wednesday, and Park said they would never work for the state health department again.",
      "\u201cThey are vile, disgusting and deranged individuals,\u201d Park told reporters.",
      "Jewish leader Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, asserted that there has been increasing extremism among Australia's medical professionals toward Sydney's Jewish community.",
      "\u201cFor months, I\u2019ve been hearing from medical practitioners in the community who have been warning about extreme content posted by other doctors and nurses online,\u201d Ryvchin told Network 10 television, adding this was not the work of \u201cisolated individuals.\u201d",
      "\"This is merely the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Ryvchina added.",

      "Veifer is a right-wing activist from Israel who uses recordings of video conversations with random users around the world to publicize his English language courses. He has had a few viral videos where he attempts to catch people making anti-Israel statements during their conversations. In an interview with Israel\u2019s right-wing Channel 14 last month, Veifer said he was making the videos in order to reveal antisemitism and anti-Israeli sentiment in the world.",
      "In the video, the two nurses purported to be doctors, according to department secretary Susan Pearce. There was no immediate information from their supervisors.",
      "The female nurse said she wouldn't treat an Israeli patient but kill them while the male nurse used expletives and a throat-slitting gesture.",
      "Park, the regional health minister, said an investigation into Bankstown Hospital has found no evidence of Jewish patients being hurt.",
      "\u201cTo the Jewish community today, I say not only am I sorry, but I can assure you this: the care that you get in our hospitals will continue to be first class,\u201d Park said, adding that the hospital's past record would also be looked into.",

      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- After 16 months of excruciating uncertainty, Idit Ohel finally received word this week that her 24-year-old son, a hostage in Gaza, is still alive.",
      "She said she fainted upon hearing the brutal details of his captivity from freed hostages who had been held with him by Hamas since Oct. 7, 2023. Bound by chains in an underground tunnel, Alon Ohel has subsisted on a piece of bread or less each day.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen sunlight in 493 days,\u201d she told reporters on Monday.",
      "As the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas seems increasingly at risk of falling apart \u2014 Hamas says it will not free three hostages on Saturday as planned, and Israel says it's ready to resume the war if it doesn't \u2014 families of the hostages are struggling to maintain hope. They are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to give up on the ceasefire framework, and to speed up the timeline of releases if possible.",
      "Their worries about the ceasefire collapsing have been exacerbated by President Donald Trump's demand that all of the hostages be freed by Saturday \u2014 and his insistence that Gaza be emptied of all Palestinians and redeveloped as a tourist enclave controlled by the United States.",
      "The emaciated state of three hostages released last Saturday has infuriated Israelis and terrified families of the remaining hostages, especially as more details come out about the conditions of their captivity.",
      "The situation is especially difficult for relatives of hostages who are not on the list of 33 hostages expected to be released in the ceasefire's first, six-week phase, which began on Jan. 19. The agreement requires Israel to free 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, whose families are also worried about how their enemy treats them.",
      "Two hostages released on Saturday, Or Levy and Eli Sharabi, were held together with Alon Ohel, and a fourth hostage, Eliya Cohen. The four were held underground since their kidnapping, Idit Ohel said.",
      "Cohen is expected to be released in the ceasefire's first stage; Ohel would be freed in the second stage, if Israel and Hamas reach that point.",
      "Levy, Ohel, and Cohen were kidnapped from a bomb shelter near a music festival in southern Israel, along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August.",
      "\u201cIt breaks my heart to know he was chained and to know what happened to him in the tunnels from people in the tunnels,\u201d Cohen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Ziv Abud, 27, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "The returned hostages said that Cohen had lost more than 20 kilograms (44 pounds) and had a bullet in his leg that did not receive medical attention. While they were with him, Cohen was unaware that Abud had survived the Hamas attack on the bomb shelter where they were hiding.",
      "During the Oct. 7 attack, militants tossed grenades and sprayed bullets inside the concrete bomb shelter near the music festival, where almost 30 people had crammed inside. At least 16 people inside the shelter were killed.",
      "Abud said she was protected by the crush of bodies above her. Going in and out of consciousness, she spent hours laying beneath the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend.",
      "For families of hostages who are not scheduled for release in the first phase of the ceasefire, its uncertainty is even more difficult to bear.",
      "Israel and Hamas were set last week to begin talks on a second phase of the ceasefire that would include an end to the war and the release of the remaining hostages. But those efforts have been frozen while the two sides trade accusations about whether the other is living up to the terms of the first phase.",
      "Tamir Nimrodi, 20, an Israeli soldier kidnapped from his post at a main crossing between Israel and Gaza, is not on the list to be freed in the first stage.",
      "His mother, Herut, said Hamas\u2019 plan to delay the next hostage release came as a shock.",
      "\u201cWe try to analyze it, think, what are the possibilities? Is this psychological terrorism they are pulling on us?\u201d she said.",
      "It\u2019s been difficult watching the hostage releases over the past few weeks, Nimrodi said, especially the emotional videos of hostages reuniting with their families.",
      "On the one hand, each reunion is a step closer to bringing back her son, whom she described as a creative person who loves riding horses and drinking sweet cocktails made with pineapple juice. But Nimrodi does not know if her son, who also holds German citizenship, is alive.",
      "The other two soldiers he was kidnapped with were killed, and she has not received any sign of life from him.",
      "\u201cI know there is a chance I won\u2019t get to the point where I can hold my son,\u201d she said.",
      "According to Israeli media, returning hostages have provided proof of life for at least seven Israeli hostages, including Cohen and Ohel.",
      "Nimrodi doesn\u2019t know what is worse \u2014 to believe her son is dead, or to receive information that he is alive, but held in conditions like Alon Ohel. \u201cI\u2019m scared if Tamir is still alive, I have no idea what he\u2019s going through, I\u2019m scared to even imagine,\u201d she said.",
      "Idit Ohel received the information about her son's condition less than an hour before she went on Israel\u2019s Channel 12 news program earlier this week.",
      "She sat at the news desk sobbing on live TV, pleading with the government to continue to the second stage of the ceasefire and bring all of the hostages home as soon as possible.",
      "Alon, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, is a talented pianist. The family has placed pianos across Israel in his honor, many of which are yellow, the color associated with the struggle for the hostages.",
      "The family marked Alon's second birthday in captivity on Monday evening in Tel Aviv, where his mother addressed the Israeli government. \u201cAfter all the sights you saw, after all the testimonies you heard from the survivors of captivity, how do you allow this situation to continue?\u201d she said.",
      "Alon did remember his younger sister, Inbar, had a birthday on Saturday and delivered her a message through the hostages who were released that day.",
      "\u201cShe got her birthday wish, to hear from her brother, which is incredible,\u201d Idit said, through tears."

      "Hegseth\u2019s trip comes just ahead of the third anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it is costing the American taxpayer too much money. Some allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that are not favorable to Ukraine.",

He will also highlight the need for increased European leadership on security assistance to Ukraine,\u201d the Pentagon said, prior to Hegseth\u2019s departure.",
      "America\u2019s 31 NATO allies also want to hear what a new Trump administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners last time by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "A senior NATO diplomat said that \u201cconstructive dialogue with the new American administration would be the most important outcome\u201d of the meeting, along with a U.S. commitment to do everything we can to keep Ukraine in the fight.\u201d",
      "The diplomat spoke to reporters on condition that he not be named, which is common practice among many member countries who make their envoys available to brief media about the latest developments ahead of NATO ministerial meetings and summits.",

      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of GDP.",
      "However, a third still do not, and Trump is almost certain to target them again.

      "Students stood outside shuttered classrooms and roamed aimlessly on Tuesday, when teachers started a two-day strike.",

      "Authorities say militia fighters in northeastern Congo have killed at least 55 civilians in an attack on a cluster of villages and a camp for displaced people camp",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Militia fighters killed at least 55 civilians in an attack on a cluster of villages and a camp for displaced people in northeastern Congo, local authorities said Tuesday.",
      "Violence has surged across eastern Congo, where conflict has raged for decades. More than 120 armed groups are fighting in the region, most for land and control of mines with valuable minerals, while some are trying to protect their communities.",
      "Armed men from the CODECO militia attacked the Djaiba group of villages, which is also home to a camp for the displaced, in the province of Ituri Monday night, Antoinnette Nzale, the leader of the camp, told The Associated Press. She said 55 civilians died but added that the death toll is likely higher, as bodies continue to be retrieved from the burned down houses.",
      "The Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or CODECO, is a loose association of militia groups mainly from the ethnic Lendu farming community. The group\u2019s attacks killed nearly 1,800 people and wounded more than 500 in the four years through 2022, according to the African Center for the Study and Research on Terrorism.",
      "The United Nations has said some of the attacks could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "\u201cAlmost the entire village was attacked,\" Nzale said, adding that the U.N. peacekeeping force known as MONUSCO and Congolese government troops intervened but were overwhelmed by the more numerous attackers.",
      "Jean Richard Lenga, chief of Bahema Badjere district, where the villages are located, confirmed the attack, adding that at least 38 people were killed. He also said the death toll is likely higher as bodies continue to be retrieved.",
      "Most of the victims were displaced people who were killed with machetes and firearms, Mumbere David, a resident of Djaiba, told the AP over the phone.",
      "In September, CODECO fighters killed at least 20 civilians in Djugu, the same territory that was attacked on Monday night.",
      "The conflict in eastern Congo escalated last month after Rwanda-backed rebels seized Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, which is about 350 kilometers (215 miles) south of Ituri province.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Trump announced Tuesday that he would send Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Ukraine to meet with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cThis War MUST and WILL END SOON \u2014 Too much Death and Destruction. The U.S. has spent BILLIONS of Dollars Globally, with little to show,\u201d Trump said in a post on his social media network about the trip.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine's government.",
      "Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn't expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it's costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren't favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.",
      "Washington's 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump's new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.",
      "However, a third of members still haven't reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn't commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.",

Somali piracy in the region at the time cost the world\u2019s economy some $7 billion \u2014 with $160 million paid out in ransoms, according to the Oceans Beyond Piracy monitoring group.",
      "Increased international naval patrols, a strengthening central government in Mogadishu, Somalia\u2019s capital, and other efforts saw the piracy beaten back.",
      "However, Somali pirate attacks have resumed at a greater pace over the last year, in part due to the insecurity caused by Yemen's Houthi rebels launching their attacks in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",

      "Across the West Bank and east Jerusalem, at least 905 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack triggered the war in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

But rock-throwing protesters and uninvolved civilians \u2014 including a 2-year-old girl, a 10-year-old boy and 73-year-old man \u2014 have also been killed in recent weeks.",

The plan was simple \u2014 they would drive to the home of Shalabi\u2019s parents outside the camp, some miles away in Tulkarem where soldiers weren't operating. It was safer there, and near the hospital where Shalabi planned to give birth. Yazan Shula's younger brother, 19-year-old Bilal, also wanted to get out and jumped in the backseat.",
      "Not long after the three of them drove off, there was a burst of gunfire. Mohammed Shula's phone rang.",

      "Austrian far-right leader Herbert Kickl says his talks on forming a coalition government with a conservative party have collapsed",
      "VIENNA -- Austrian far-right leader Herbert Kickl said Wednesday that his talks on forming a coalition government with a conservative party have collapsed.",
      "Austria\u2019s president gave Kickl a mandate to try to form a new government on Jan. 6 after other parties' efforts to put together a governing alliance without his Freedom Party failed.",
      "But his talks with the conservative Austrian People\u2019s Party appeared increasingly troubled in recent days, with constant talk of policy differences and a clash over who would get which ministries.",
      "On Wednesday, Kickl informed President Alexander Van der Bellen that he was giving up the mandate to form what would have been the first national government headed by the far right since World War II.",
      "Kickl\u2019s anti-immigration and euroskeptic party, which opposes sanctions against Russia, won Austria\u2019s parliamentary election in September. It took 28.8% of the vote and beat then Chancellor Karl Nehammer\u2019s People\u2019s Party into second place.",
      "But in October, President Alexander Van der Bellen gave Nehammer the first chance to form a new government after Nehammer\u2019s party said that it wouldn\u2019t go into government with the Freedom Party under Kickl and others refused to work with the Freedom Party at all.",
      "Those negotiations collapsed in the first few days of the new year and Nehammer resigned, making way for interim Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg.",
      "Kickl pointed the finger at the People's Party for the collapse. In a letter to the president released by his party, he said that his prospective parties had insisted on sharing out the ministries in a new government before clearing up disputed policy points and they had been unable to reach an agreement.",
      "\u201cI do not take this step without regret,\u201d he added. But he said that there appeared to be no point in trying to negotiate with the center-left Social Democrats, the only other party with which the Freedom Party could reach a parliamentary majority. It has refused to work with Kickl's party.",
      "\u201cAustria has no time to waste,\u201d Kickl said.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what will happen next \u2014 whether Austria will move on to a new election, whether other parties will make another effort to form an alternative coalition, or whether a nonpartisan government of experts might be appointed for at least an interim period.",

    "story": [
      "During a time of pressure on public broadcasters, PBS says that it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and firing the two executives who staffed it",
      "NEW YORK -- PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Donald Trump's executive order, firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio girds for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than it has faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \u201cwe were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\u201d",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it is filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \u201cWe're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\u201d Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \u201csystemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\u201d",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. U.S. Sen. Mike Lee posted \u201clet's defund PBS and NPR\u201d on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\u201cI think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\u201d",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \u201cthere is bias at play\u201d when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \u201cWe take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\u201d she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\u201cI'm always an optimistic person,\u201d Kerger said, \u201cbut I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is on the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration",
      "BRUSSELS -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday made the first trip to NATO by a member of the new Trump administration, as the allies wait to learn how much military and financial support Washington intends to provide to Ukraine's government.",
      "Hegseth held talks with U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey, before a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Hegseth's predecessor, former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, set up the forum for drumming up arms and ammunition for Ukraine in 2022.",
      "Over nearly three years, around 50 countries have collectively provided Ukraine more than $126 billion in weapons and military assistance. But the meeting this week was convened by another country for the first time: the United Kingdom. All previous gatherings of the forum were chaired by the United States.",
      "No decision has been made on who might chair the next meeting, if one is called.",
      "Hegseth wasn't expected to make any announcement on new weapons for Ukraine.",
      "His trip comes less than two weeks before the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. Most U.S. allies fear that Russian President Vladimir Putin won't stop at Ukraine\u2019s borders if he wins, and that Europe\u2019s biggest land war in decades poses an existential threat to their security.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has promised to quickly end the war. He\u2019s complained that it's costing American taxpayers too much money. He has suggested that Ukraine should pay for U.S. support with access to its rare earth minerals, energy and other resources.",
      "Some U.S. allies worry that a hasty deal might be clinched on terms that aren't favorable to Ukraine. On top of that, Trump appears to believe that European countries should take responsibility for Ukraine's security going forward.",
      "Washington's 31 NATO allies also want to hear what Trump's new administration has in store for the world\u2019s biggest security organization. Trump traumatized his European partners during his first term in office by threatening not to defend any member that doesn\u2019t meet NATO guidelines for military spending.",
      "NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any ally must be considered an attack on them all and met with a collective response. Membership is considered to be the ultimate security guarantee, and it\u2019s one that Ukraine is trying to secure.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s security needs and defense spending will be discussed on Thursday. European allies have hiked their military budgets since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, and 23 are estimated to have reached or exceeded last year the target of spending 2% of gross domestic product.",
      "However, a third of members still haven't reached that threshold, and Trump is almost certain to target them again. Recently, Trump called for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a level that no member has reached so far \u2014 not even Poland, which is the closest, spending more than 4% and expected to approach 5% this year.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Germany on Tuesday, Hegseth wouldn't commit to having the U.S. increase its defense spending to 5% of GDP. Hegseth said that he believes that the U.S. should spend more than it did under the Biden administration and \u201cshould not go lower than 3 percent.\u201d",
      "He said any final decision would be up to Trump, but added that \u201cwe live in fiscally constrained times\u201d and need to be responsible with taxpayer money. The U.S. spends about 3.3% of GDP on defense.",
      "NATO leaders are expected to agree on new spending targets at their next planned summit, in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-26.",

      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax. If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he did pretty much the same thing during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s original metals tariffs gave America\u2019s struggling steel and aluminum producers some relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. In anticipation of the new tariffs, shares of steel and aluminum producers climbed Monday. Nucor rose 5.6%, Cleveland-Cliffs jumped 17.9% and Alcoa ticked up 2.2%.",
      "But the tariffs took a toll last time, too, damaging U.S. relations with key allies and driving up costs for \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 U.S. producers that buy steel and aluminum and use them to manufacture goods.",
      "Timothy Zimmerman is CEO of one of those downstream companies: Mitchell Metal Products in Merrill, Wisconsin. And he still has bad memories of those times.",
      "\u201cWe were significantly impacted,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe challenges we faced were unprecedented -- rapid inflationary impacts from domestic steel producers. We saw steel prices rise within a few months about 70% over what they had been ... Our (steel) suppliers simply broke contracts and gave us an option: Take this or take nothing.\u2019\u2019",
      "But Mitchell Metal Products was locked into contracts with its own customers \u2014 a wide range of businesses from furniture makers to telecommunications firms -- that didn\u2019t allow it to pass along all or part of the higher cost. His company\u2019s profit margins were squeezed, and it ended up losing business to European rivals that didn\u2019t have to contend with the fallout from Trump\u2019s steel tariffs.",
      "The overall economic impact on the United States was limited then \u2013 and is likely to be limited again -- because steel and aluminum imports amount to barely a ripple in the almost $30 trillion U.S. economy.",
      "Still, the new taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and Trump\u2019s other import tax plans \u2013 including his promise to raise American tariffs to match those charged by other countries -- are likely \u201cto boost U.S. inflation and weigh on global growth this year,\u2019\u2019 Jennifer McKeown and Hamad Hussain of Capital Economics wrote Monday.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs would hit U.S. allies. Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and aluminum to the United States. Mexico is the No. 3 steel supplier, and Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S.",
      "China is widely seen as source of the world steel industry\u2019s problems. Chinese overproduction has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere. But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out all but a trickle of Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, making it the No. 10 supplier of steel to the U.S., according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group.",
      "In slapping duties on steel and aluminum nearly seven years ago, Trump reached into the federal government\u2019s tariff toolkit and pulled out Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 gives the president the power to impose tariffs on other countries national security grounds.",
      "The 2018 tariffs \u2014 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum \u2014 provoked outrage in Canada and Mexico, U.S. neighbors and allies that resented being hit with trade sanctions and labeled as threats to U.S. national security.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs also drew retaliation as U.S. trading partners hit back with taxes on U.S. exports from Kentucky bourbon to Levi\u2019s jeans.",
      "By making foreign steel costlier, the tariffs allowed U.S. steelmakers to raise prices and encouraged them to keep mills running and to invest in new capacity.",
      "But the tariffs hammered downstream businesses like Zimmerman\u2019s that had to pay the higher prices. In 2021, production at downstream companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, according to a 2023 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that investigates trade disputes.",
      "In 2020, researchers from Harvard University and the University of California, Davis, found that the tariffs created 1,000 jobs \u2013 but reduced employment elsewhere by 75,000. When the tariffs hit seven years ago, Mitchell Metal Products employed a peak of 102 workers. It had to cut its payrolls by leaving openings unfilled and weeding out some workers. The company now employs about 75 people.",
      "Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that Trump\u2019s first-term trade wars, including his tariffs on most Chinese imports, were costly to American industry.",
      "\u201cThe net effect of all these tariffs at that time \u2014 on China, aluminum, steel, plus retaliation \u2014 was to reduce U.S. manufacturing unemployment,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting the same thing this time around.\u2019\u2019",
      "The 2018 metals tariffs were partially eased. For some countries, they were dropped. For some, they were replaced with import quotas. On Monday, Trump removed all exceptions and exemptions on the original tariffs and upped the levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.",
      "Zimmerman is bracing for the new tariffs to hit. \u201cAlready last week several large (steel) mills operating in the United States announced price increases in anticipation of the tariffs, not due to increased demand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI think the domestic producers will work to do the same thing, or very close to the same thing, as what happened in 2018.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, he said, Mitchell Metal Products will seek to be more pro-active in getting its customers to absorb some of the higher costs. Otherwise, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a healthy place to be as a company.\u2019\u2019",

      "India wants more nuclear power, has pledged over $2 billion toward research and will change laws to boost investment to do it",
      "BENGALURU, India -- India wants more nuclear power, has pledged over $2 billion toward research and will change laws to boost investment to do it.",
      "The pledges were made by India's finance minister earlier this month as part of a plan to expand electricity generation and reduce emissions. Nuclear power is a way to make electricity that doesn't emit planet-warming gases, although it does create radioactive waste. India is one of the world\u2019s biggest emitters of planet-heating gases and over 75% of its power is still generated by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal. India wants to install 100 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2047 \u2014 enough to power nearly 60 million Indian homes a year.",
      "Energy experts say that for the world to move away from carbon-polluting fuels like coal, oil and gas, sources like nuclear that don't rely on the sun and the wind \u2014 which aren't always available \u2014 are needed. But some are skeptical about India's ambitions as the country's nuclear sector is still very small, and negative public perceptions about the industry remain.",
      "To grow the sector, Shayak Sengupta, a senior research associate at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, said the new Trump administration's desire to reconfigure trade could be beneficial. India's nuclear growth plan provides \u201cample opportunity\u201d for U.S. exports, as the nuclear power sector there is much more mature, and companies are working on developments in the technology, like smaller and cheaper nuclear reactors. India is also investing in small reactors.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s is set to meet President Trump on Wednesday. The pair are expected to discuss nuclear power, among other topics, according to India's oil minister.",
      "Nuclear power is around three times as expensive as solar energy in India and can take up to six years to install as opposed to similar amounts of solar that usually take less than a year. Newer small modular reactors are cheaper and faster to build, but they also make less electricity.",
      "India has managed to double the amount of nuclear power installed in the country in the last decade, but it still makes up just 3% of its electricity.",
      "Still, \u201cthe first challenge remains convincing the public to let the projects get deployed in their vicinity,\u201d said Ruchita Shah, an energy analyst at the climate think-tank, Ember. Local communities have protested at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in southern India and at proposed nuclear sites in the western state of Maharashtra in the last decade, citing security and environmental concerns.",
      "But for investors and governments, \u201cthe level of interest (in nuclear power) now is the highest it's been since the oil crises in the 1970s,\u201d said Brent Wanner, head of the power sector unit at the International Energy Agency. That's because it's reliable and clean, he said.",
      "The IEA found that 63 nuclear reactors are currently under construction globally, the most since 1990.",
      "Wanner said governments are critical in getting nuclear power projects underway and India's plan \u201cvery positive\u201d for the nuclear industry.",
      "Even with its eye on nuclear, India shouldn't forget about other sources of energy that don't emit greenhouse gases, said Madhura Joshi, from the climate think tank E3G.",
      "\u201cSolar, other renewables and storage can come up much faster and quicker,\" Joshi said, delivering \u201cthe immediate solutions that are needed.\u201d",

      "Trump said over the weekend he would announce 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, with more import duties to come later in the week.",
      "Fear around tariffs has been at the center of Wall Street\u2019s moves recently, and experts say the market likely has more swings ahead. The price of gold, which often rises when investors are feeling nervous, climbed again Monday to top $2,930 per ounce and set another record.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid 82 points, about 0.18%. The S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures respectively fell 0.28% and 0.36%.",
      "But Trump has shown he can be just as quick to pull back on threats, like he did with 25% tariffs he had announced on Canada and Mexico, suggesting they may be merely a negotiating chip rather than a true long-term policy.",
      "Trump has pressed ahead with 10% tariffs on Chinese goods, while China has retaliated by imposing tariffs on U.S. coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s restraint in targeting only a small sliver of U.S. goods is deemed to be a deliberately less than proportionate response to avert an escalatory tit-for-tat spiral,\u201d said Vishnu Varathan, head of macro research at Mizuho.",
      "\u201cNonetheless, the reality is that U.S.-China trade tensions are set to structurally ramp-up, even if a negotiated compromise is the endgame for Trump 2.0 tariffs,\" Varathan added.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 40.45 points to 6,066.44 on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 167.01 to 44,4701.41, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 190.87 to 19,714.27.",
      "In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.50%. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with short-term interest rates, fell to 4.27% from 4.29%.",
      "The Fed cut its main interest rate several times through the end of last year, but traders have been sharply curtailing their expectations for more reductions in 2025, in part because of fears about potentially higher inflation from tariffs. While lower rates can give a boost to the economy and investment prices, they can also give inflation more fuel.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be offering testimony before Congress later this week, where he could offer more hints about what the Fed is thinking. In December, Fed officials sent financial markets sharply lower  after indicating they may cut rates only twice this year.",
      "In energy trading, benchmark U.S crude added 51 cents to $72.83 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 44 cents to $76.31 a barrel.",
      "In currency trading, the U.S. dollar remained largely unchanged at about 151.95 Japanese yen. The euro cost $1.0305, also largely unchanged.",

      "\u201cSafe, reliable roads are a primary responsibility of the state, yet there are limited funds to fulfill an unlimited need,\u201d Lee said in prepared remarks during his annual State of the State speech Monday evening.",
      "Some parts of the budget were already filled in after a quick special session last month. Lee convinced lawmakers to pass more than $900 million worth of initiatives from different pots of money. They include a huge expansion of vouchers to help students attend private school, coupled with public school teacher raises; relief for areas devastated by Hurricane Helene; and changes to help President Donald Trump's administration with its immigration deportation crackdown plans.",
      "Lee elevated roadwork as a priority in 2023, when his legislation included a $3 billion infusion for projects and a hike in electric vehicle and hybrid fees. It also opened the door for allowing express toll lanes on highways through public-private partnerships, which hasn't been implemented yet as officials initially consider it for a stretch of Interstate 24 from Nashville to the southeastern suburbs.",
      "Tennessee isn't alone. Many states have likewise taken a variety of steps to supplement their gas taxes, which aren't keeping up with their needed roadwork as more people drive electric vehicles and hybrids.",
      "Meanwhile, Lee proposed directing $11 million to the Boys and Girls Club to help boost their childcare programs throughout the state, as well as expand eligibility to a state program that supplements childcare worker salaries.",
      "\u201cToday, infant care in Tennessee carries virtually the same price tag as in-state tuition at a four-year public college,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat is an insurmountable cost for the vast majority of moms and dads who want to be in the workforce.\u201d",
      "Lee boasted that his proposals would result in \u201ctens of thousands of new daycare spots across rural and urban Tennessee\u201d but did not provide additional details on how or when that goal would be achieved. Nor did he specify who exactly it would serve. For example, many of the Boys and Girls Club locations in Tennessee only offer daycare services to children 5 years old and up.",
      "Also in Monday's speech, Lee proposed a $60 million fund that would create 0% construction loans to build single-family homes. And while the governor's budget does not contain any new tax breaks for Tennesseans, Lee said he plans on funding a tax credit enacted last year that would give incentives to developers building affordable housing.",
      "\u201cThese are important steps, and together, we should continue looking for more solutions that are fiscally responsible to finally address the issue of housing \u2013- through innovation, not through regulation,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee is proposing tens of millions of dollars more to invest in nuclear energy, as well. In his plan, the state would contribute $50 million to help the Tennessee Valley Authority develop a small modular reactor. The federal utility has applied for an $800 million U.S. Department of Energy grant for the initiative."

      "A jury has convened in London for an ancient ceremony to certify that British coins meet the strictest of standards",
      "LONDON -- In a nation where money is counted in pounds and pence, the measure of coins is given great weight \u2014 and a lavish ceremony.",
      "Judges in red robes and white gloves convened Tuesday in the ornate livery hall of London's Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths for an ancient tradition dating back to the 12th century to certify Britain's coinage for circulation.",
      "The test, known as the Trial of the Pyx, was designed to prevent counterfeiting by inspecting and weighing a sampling of thousands of coins from The Royal Mint to ensure they met strict standards.",
      "\u201cIt's a way of making sure that if you\u2019re in the U.K. the coins that are in your pocket are real and reliable, that you know what they\u2019re made of, that they are up to the right standards,\u201d said Eleni Bide, the librarian for the Goldsmiths' Company. \u201cThat provides a challenge for people who want to fake them. So making really standardized perfect coins is a really important part of preventing forgery.\"",
      "The mint submitted nearly 6,500 coins for testing that included future pocket change and limited edition collectibles made of precious metals, including Harry Potter and Star Wars collections. In the past year, the mint has produced coins honoring Beatle Paul McCartney, the late musician George Michael and the writer George Orwell.",
      "It also included a sixpence made from silver recycled from expired medical and industrial X-ray films.",
      "The ceremony gets its name from the ancient Greek word \u201cpyxis,\u201d or small box. Coins are presented in so-called Pyx boxes and jurors randomly select them for testing.",
      "While the judges still used magnifying glasses to inspect the silver and gold pieces, the real testing takes place over months in labs.",
      "The jury will deliver its verdict in May to the nation\u2019s treasury chief, who also serves as master of the mint and is responsible for the quality of the coins.",
      "\u201cHistorically, if they\u2019d been found to have overseen badly produced coins, they would have been financially liable to recompense the Treasury for the money lost because of that,\u201d Bide said. \u201cNowadays, I don\u2019t think that would happen. But if anything did go wrong, if a fault was found, it\u2019s unlikely, but it\u2019s possible that if a fault was found, that would be a big prompt to go and make sure that the processes in the mint were running OK.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential in many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It is unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yerkmak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally does not freeze military support, which would be devastating for the country that will soon enter its fourth year of war against Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it is in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for over 20 critical raw materials and concluded that the country\u2019s accession to the EU could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It is unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "In addition to the steel and China tariffs, other tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods have been temporarily put on hol d, but they could be implemented later. So, small business owners still need a strategy for mitigating the costs of the tariffs if they go into effect.",

      "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time",
      "BEIJING -- Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father\u2019s panicked voice: The brakes don\u2019t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car\u2019s brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described \u201c free speech absolutist.\u201d Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang\u2019s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It is not common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China\u2019s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla\u2019s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump\u2019s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla\u2019s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party \u2014 are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla\u2019s windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\u201cThe government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\u201d said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \u201cThat\u2019s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\u201d",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang\u2019s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad\u2019s fault because he hadn\u2019t maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\u201d Zhang said in an interview. \u201cI was burning with anger.\u201d",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \u201cTesla brake failure\u201d in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla\u2019s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \u201cTesla Model 3 brakes failed,\u201d she said. \u201cA family of four almost died.\u201d The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \u201cBrakes fail\u201d and headed for Tesla\u2019s booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker\u2019s officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn\u2019t get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \u201cTesla brakes fail!\u201d",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\u201cThings escalated,\u201d said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out, and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang\u2019s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn\u2019t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \u201chad someone behind her\u201d and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive\u2019s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company\u2019s own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang\u2019s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang\u2019s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she\u2019d been asking for, but they\u2019d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn\u2019t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she\u2019d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang\u2019s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world\u2019s most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\u201cI refuse to accept it,\u201d Zhang told the Associated Press, \u201cAs a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\u201d",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it\u2019s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People\u2019s Court said that judgments are the result of a \u201cfair trial\u201d based on \u201cthe objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\u201cIt cannot be assumed that the party has received \u2018special protection\u2019 or \u2018special treatment\u2019 because of their victory,\u201d the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it\u2019s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it\u2019s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\u201cFor Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\u201d said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \u201cThe odds are stacked against you. It\u2019s like going to the casino and winning every hand.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China\u2019s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China\u2019s financial capital.",
      "With Li\u2019s support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world\u2019s richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla\u2019s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China\u2019s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world\u2019s largest EV-battery maker. China\u2019s BYD is now the world\u2019s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\u201cTesla had a large part to play in that,\u201d said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk\u2019s factory was critical. \u201cIt was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they\u2019re rolling cars off the line,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\u201d",

      "Mexican businessman Carlos Slim, one of the world\u2019s richest people, holds forth once a year on a wide range of topics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Carlos Slim, Mexico\u2019s richest man and one of the world's wealthiest, addressed a range of topics at his annual conference on Monday. Despite his extensive holdings in sectors ranging from communications and construction to an iconic Mexican restaurant and retail chain, much of the questioning centered \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 on U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Here are some highlights of Slim's address at the headquarters of one of his companies in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do. He only has four years,\u201d Slim said about Trump's second term.",
      "Slim met Trump during his first term while negotiating the free trade agreement, describing him then as a \u201cnegotiator, not a terminator.\u201d Now, weeks into Trump's second term, Slim only commented that the situation Trump faces is complicated.",
      "\u201cWhat the U.S. has to do is regain global leadership,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt would be interesting if he did a sort of double play, let\u2019s say on one side reduce the costs of certain things and on the other channel it toward investment.\u201d",
      "Slim said bluntly that tariffs don't work. \"They increase inflation \u2026 the interest rate doesn\u2019t go down \u2026 tariffs don\u2019t solve problems.\u201d",
      "He said Trump's tariff threats are simply a negotiating tool.",
      "Slim said the 25% tariffs announced Monday by Trump on all steel and aluminum products wouldn't have much impact on Mexico, because some Mexican steel producers also have U.S. operations.",
      "Moreover, he said a general tariff on Mexican imports is unlikely, because Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump are following through on an agreement that would pause tariffs in exchange for bolstering border security.",
      "\u201cThe United States\u2019 situation isn\u2019t good \u2026 The United States stopped producing things,\u201d Slim said, noting that it outsourced a lot of production abroad simply because it was cheaper.",
      "\u201cThe United States has to see what things it can produce and what it can\u2019t,\u201d he said, citing the semiconductor industry\u2019s resurgence as a prime example of the need for domestic manufacturing.",
      "Trump has proposed reducing corporate taxes as a means of attracting businesses back to the United States, but Slim disagrees, arguing that this tactic alone will not suffice.",
      "\u201cYou have to speak with them and remind them that their country is the United States and encourage them to bring their overseas operations home,\" Slim said.",
      "He rejected the idea that the world\u2019s largest fortunes should be taxed, as some propose, because then those fortunes would go elsewhere. \u201cThe trick is that people work,\u201d he said. Creating jobs, not just giving donations.",
      "Slim said he did not meet tech billionaire Elon Musk at Trump's inauguration, but although he agrees with some of his ideas, he would not invest with him because his bets are very risky.",
      "While Slim agrees the U.S. needs to cut wasteful spending, he thinks this is something that should be done with care, not shutting down things in one swipe like \u201cwhen he reduced 80% of Twitter staff.\u201d",
      "Slim said he advocates for more security presence on the border from both the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"Double the guard here so that nothing gets out, and there so that nothing comes in.\u201d Over in the U.S., he said, they keep the drugs and the money and here, the weapons and the violence.",

      "A new lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of stiffing U.S. businesses of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done amid its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration\u2019s dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development is stiffing American businesses on hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid bills for work that has already been done, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.",
      "The administration\u2019s abrupt freeze on foreign aid also is forcing mass layoffs by U.S. suppliers and contractors for USAID, including 750 furloughs at one company, Washington-based Chemonics International, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cOne cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\u201d the U.S. businesses and organizations said.",
      "An organization representing 170 small U.S. businesses, major suppliers, an American Jewish group aiding displaced people abroad, the American Bar Association and others joined the court challenge.",
      "It was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington against President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acting USAID Deputy Administrator Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who has been a central figure in hollowing out the agency, and Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s head of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "It is at least the third lawsuit over the administration's rapid unraveling of the U.S. aid and development agency and its programs worldwide. Trump and ally Elon Musk have targeted USAID in particular, saying its work is out of line with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Marocco, Musk and Rubio have overseen an across-the-board freeze on foreign assistance and agency shutdown under a Jan. 20 executive order by Trump. A lawsuit brought by federal employees associations has temporarily blocked the administration from pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job. The funding freeze and other measures have persisted, including the agency losing the lease on its Washington headquarters.",
      "The new administration terminated contracts without the required 30-day notice and without back payments for work that was already done, according to a U.S. official, a businessperson with a USAID contract and an email seen by The Associated Press. They spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal by the Trump administration.",
      "For Chemonics, one of the larger of the USAID partners, that has meant $103 million in unpaid invoices and almost $500 million in USAID-ordered medication, food and other goods now stalled in the supply chain or ports, the lawsuit says.",
      "For the health commodities alone, not delivering them \u201con time could potentially lead to as many as 566,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and unmet reproductive health needs, including 215,000 pediatric deaths,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The filing asserts that the administration has no authority to block programs and funding mandated by Congress without approval.",
      "Marocco defended the funding cutoff and push to put all but a fraction of USAID staff in an affidavit filed late Monday in the lawsuit brought by the workers\u2019 groups.",
      "\u201cInsubordination\u201d and \u201cnoncompliance\u201d by USAID staffers made it necessary to stop funding and operations by the agency to allow the administration to carry out a program-by-program review to decide what U.S. aid programs could resume overseas, Marocco wrote."

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:06:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Like a watered-down drink, domestic sales for American whiskeys were unsatisfying in 2024 as inflation reined in consumer spending on some distilled spirits",
    "story": [
      "Like a watered-down drink, domestic sales for American whiskeys were unsatisfying in 2024 as inflation reined in consumer spending on some distilled spirits",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Like a watered-down drink, domestic sales for American whiskeys were unsatisfying in 2024, as inflation reined in consumer spending on some distilled spirits. But it's tariffs that loom as one of the stiffest challenges ahead, threatening to deplete sales in key foreign markets, an industry group said Tuesday.",
      "Brewing trade conflicts with Canada and Mexico risk driving up the price of U.S. spirits in those markets. The biggest risk is in the European Union, where tariffs are set to resume April 1 at double the rate on American whiskey producers, who again find themselves ensnared in a trade dispute over steel and aluminum. The new tariff would undo the strong rebound in American whiskey sales in Europe since a 25% EU tariff was suspended a few years ago, the Distilled Spirits Council said.",
      "\u201cThe reimposition of these tariffs at a 50% rate would gut this growth and do irreparable harm to distillers large and small,\u201d Chris Swonger, the council's CEO, said of the EU. \"It would be a catastrophic blow that will force many distillers out of our largest export market.\u201d",
      "Talk of tariffs cast a shadow over the council's report on 2024 U.S. spirits sales, which revealed a drop in domestic sales for the American whiskey category, which includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey. The council didn't break out sales for each type of whiskey.",
      "As President Donald Trump pushes to reset global trade, U.S. spirits can be a high-profile target for retaliation. During trade conflicts in Trump's first term, American whiskey exports to the EU plunged by 20%, the council said. Once the tariff was suspended, those exports surged by 60%, it said.",
      "Canada, another key export market for American spirits, initially ordered tariffs on American imports, including beverages, until a reprieve was announced last week. Before the pause, authorities in several provinces said they planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves.",
      "Trump has alternately said he sees import taxes as tool to force concessions on issues such as immigration, but also as a source of revenue to help close the government\u2019s budget deficit.",
      "But anxiety is now high among whiskey producers and their supporters, many of them in states that voted overwhelmingly to return Trump to the White House. That includes Kentucky, where 95% of the world's bourbon supply is crafted and where a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon were aging at the start of 2024, according to the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association.",
      "The renewed tariff threats arrive with Boundary Oak Distillery in central Kentucky trying to establish a foothold in the EU to augment its domestic sales in 12 to 15 U.S. states.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying very hard to make a presence,\" Brent Goodin, the distillery\u2019s owner, said by phone this week. \"Craft products, especially craft bourbons, are appreciated all over the world.\u201d",
      "His family-owned craft distillery shipped about 200 cases of its bourbon and lavender whiskey to Lithuania last fall, he said. He's preparing to send another shipment soon, having spread distribution to Poland and with hopes of cracking what he sees as a potentially big market in Hungary, he said.",
      "It all could come crashing down if his products get hit with a 50% tax.",
      "\u201cThat would wipe out the market,\" Goodin said. \"That would pretty much kill it.\u201d",
      "Spirit exports come from 45 states, and American whiskeys account for 63% of all U.S. spirits exports, the council said. The spirits industry is hoping cooler heads prevail to produce trade deals that keep their products from getting entangled again in back-and-forth tariffs.",
      "It comes as spirits producers encounter headwinds at home in the U.S.",
      "Overall, the spirits industry maintained its advantage in U.S. market share but its revenues slipped in 2024, the council said. Spirits supplier sales in the U.S. fell 1.1% to total $37.2 billion, while volumes rose 1.1% to 312.2 million 9-liter cases, it said.",
      "Revenue and volumes for super premium spirits, which fetch the highest prices, fell last year as inflation-weary buyers picked slightly less-expensive options. The combination of high inflation and interest rates forced many to \"reduce spending on little luxuries like distilled spirits,\u201d Swonger said.",
      "The industrywide results reflect a return to more normal domestic levels following sales spikes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Swonger said. Another challenge is that younger adults appear to be imbibing less.",
      "Domestic sales of American whiskeys fell 1.8% in 2024 to total $5.2 billion in revenue, the council said.",
      "Vodka sales were flat, totaling $7.2 billion, while tequila and mezcal sales rose 2.9% to total $6.7 billion last year, the council said. Sales of premixed cocktails, including ready-to-drink spirits products, surged 16.5% to $3.3 billion, it said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance has dealt a blow organizations fighting human trafficking and forced labor in Cambodia, where tens of thousands of people are held captive and forced to work in call centers running telephone scams",
      "BANGKOK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s freeze on foreign assistance has dealt a blow to organizations fighting human trafficking and forced labor in Cambodia, where tens of thousands of people are held captive and forced to work in call centers running telephone scams.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people work in remote compounds in countries including Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos where they run online scams targeting people all over the world, including Americans, according to U.N. estimates. Some are trafficked and lured to the jobs under false pretenses and forced to work against their will.",
      "A shelter for people who manage to leave these compounds run by the Catholic charity Caritas recently let some victims go and may stop accepting further victims due to the funding squeeze, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation said. The shelter, in the capital Phnom Penh is the only one not operated by the government which takes in victims of scam compounds, both foreign and Cambodian. The sources declined to be named because they were concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration.",
      "The funding freeze has also halted civil-society-assisted rescue work and related programs on preventing human trafficking.",
      "The compounds operate with support from some local elites. Last October, the U.S. sanctioned Ly Yong Phat, a leading member of the ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party of Prime Minister Hun Manet, for owning businesses that have trafficked people and forced to work in online scam centers.",
      "The blow to civil society efforts comes as a small network of society and independent media addressing Cambodia\u2019s scam compounds are already under intense government pressure. Independent media outlets have been shuttered, and a prominent Cambodian investigative journalist who had reported on the issue was arrested.",
      "The Trump Administration froze U.S. foreign assistance in January, upending projects all over the world that ranged from providing medications to HIV patients to humanitarian assistance to people displaced by conflict.",
      "While there are other shelters in Cambodia, the one operated by Caritas \u201cis the only qualified and competent shelter,\u201d said Jake Sims, a co-founder of Shamrock, a public-private coalition working to combat transnational organized cybercrime. It offers victims trauma-informed care, as well as help with visas and legal support so they can go back to their home countries.",
      "The Caritas shelter received financial support from Winrock International, USAID\u2019s partner in Cambodia. It was due to receive about $1 million from USAID over the course of two years, the sources said. The shelter was also partially funded by IOM, a United Nations agency which is largely funded by the U.S.",
      "Neither USAID, IOM nor the government of Cambodia responded to requests for comment.",
      "Some people manage to leave the compounds, either making their own escapes \u2014 sometimes jumping out of windows \u2014 or relying on a few rescue operators who assist the Cambodian police. There\u2019s also a Cambodian government rescue hotline.",
      "When victims do get out, they often have trouble returning home. They are usually held in police custody and then sent on to immigration detention where they may linger for months. Many don\u2019t have any savings and may need legal help if they entered the country illegally with smugglers, rescuers say.",
      "Shelters are critical for ensuring victims don\u2019t wind up being trafficked again, said Mina Chiang, founder of Humanity Research Consultancy, which has conducted research on the scam compounds in the region.",
      "\u201cIn 2022, my team and I have learnt cases where Taiwanese survivors became homeless on the streets of Cambodia after escaping the scam compounds,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have also been cases where survivors were hunted down by criminals after they had escaped.\u201d",
      "Li Ling, a rescue worker who has referred cases to the Caritas shelter, said she has had to stop assisting in rescues of scam workers because of the funding freeze.",
      "Six victims left the shelter as soon as it got a stop-work order, and two of them have subsequently disappeared, said Li, who\u2019s also a PhD student at Ca\u2019Foscari University of Venice studying cyber-enabled modern slavery. She had asked them to stay in regular contact after their departure and said she is concerned they may have wound up back in a scam compound, as they did not have any savings and planned to look for jobs for food and shelter.",
      "Other organizations that support scam center victims have also taken a hit from the funding freeze, such as one which provides medical assistance to victims who injured in escapes, said Li.",
      "For example, last year, they had helped someone who jumped out of a building to escape a scam compound. The organization helped pay for the emergency surgery for the victim, but that source of funds has also stopped.",
      "The funding freeze has also led to the cancellation of other related programs focused on preventing human trafficking.",
      "One non-profit organization registered in the region was due to start a training program with community journalists across Southeast Asia to raise awareness about scam compounds and their recruitment processes. Another labor-focused organization was due to start a training program with labor unions in six Southeast Asian countries on recognizing signs of trafficking, the sources with knowledge of the funding said.",
      "The organizations asked to not be named due to the fear of government retaliation.",
      "Ongoing research funded by to keep track of the latest developments in the scam compounds and the Cambodian government response has also been halted, the source with knowledge of the funding said. Research consultants funded by USAID's counter-trafficking program wrote internal reports for the agency on the criminal activity that are also sometimes shared with Congressional staff, as well as different parts of the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWith U.S. government support now abruptly removed, we can expect an acceleration in civil society repression,\u201d Jake Sims.",
      "Last October, the Cambodian government arrested a well-known investigative journalist who had reported extensively on the proliferation of scam compounds in the country.",
      "After widespread international attention and the support of local media organizations, journalist Mech Dara was released on bail after about a month. Afterward, he made a public statement that he would quit journalism.",
      "Even if new funding is secured, restarting anti-trafficking programs could be more costly, since programs have already been shuttered and contract workers have been let go.",
      "\u201cThe knock-on effect of the USAID funding freeze extends beyond the trafficking and re-trafficking of vulnerable people; it strengthens criminal networks, allowing them to expand their operations,\u201d said Humanity Research Consultancy's Chiang."

      "The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from attending an event in the Oval Office after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America",
      "NEW YORK -- The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed the Gulf of America.",
      "The reporter, whom the AP would not identify, tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Later, a second AP reporter was barred from a late-evening event in the White House Diplomatic Room.",
      "The highly unusual ban, which Trump administration officials had threatened earlier Tuesday unless the AP changed the style on the Gulf, could have constitutional free-speech implications.",
      "Julie Pace, AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called the administration's move unacceptable.",
      "\u201cIt is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,\u201d Pace said in a statement. \u201cLimiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP\u2019s speech not only severely impedes the public\u2019s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the moves, and there was no indication any other journalists were affected. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media. On Friday, the administration ejected a second group of news organizations from Pentagon office space.",
      "Before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump announced plans to change the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2014 and signed an executive order to do so as soon as he was in office. Mexico\u2019s president responded sarcastically and others noted that the name change would probably not affect global usage.",
      "Besides the United States, the body of water \u2014 named the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years \u2014 also borders Mexico.",
      "The AP said last month, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that it would continue to refer to the Gulf of Mexico while noting Trump\u2019s decision to rename it as well. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP says it must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.",
      "AP style is not only used by the agency. The AP Stylebook is relied on by thousands of journalists and other writers globally.",
      "Barring the AP reporter was an affront to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the government from impeding the freedom of the press, said Tim Richardson, program director of journalism and misinformation for PEN America.",

    "summary": "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for &ldquo;world-class drivers&rdquo; could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
    "story": [
      "A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\u201d could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- A controversial new NASCAR rule designed for \u201cworld-class drivers\" could give Helio Castroneves an automatic berth into the Daytona 500, and, should the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner use the provisional, it would make for the largest field in a decade.",
      "It's a complicated rule that was written into the charter agreement that 13 teams signed last September and is similar to a \u201cpromoters provisional\u201d in that it gives NASCAR the ability to designate one driver as a guaranteed 41st entry.",
      "Three-time Daytona 500 Denny Hamlin said the rule \u201creeks of desperation\u201d by NASCAR, calling it nothing but a gimmick to attract big stars to stock car racing. Others wondered why the provisional went to Castroneves, who at 49 will be making his NASCAR debut, instead of seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, a two-time Daytona 500 winner.",
      "The rule is designed for drivers who don't currently race full time in NASCAR, so Johnson and 2017 Cup Series champion Martin Truex Jr. would have been eligible for consideration for the provisional.",
      "But their teams never put in the request, which must be done 90 days before the event. Only Trackhouse Racing requested the provisional for Castroneves, who enters Wednesday's qualifying as the only driver eligible for the 41st spot.",
      "\u201cI think Jimmie Johnson is a world-class driver, but I guess other people don\u2019t,\u201d Alex Bowman said. \"It\u2019s an interesting rule for sure. There\u2019s a lot of hype and importance to the sport to have people like (Castroneves) that come in and, if they miss the race, it kind of hurts the whole thing.",
      "\"So I get it, but I also wish some of our past champions were respected in the same way in some sense.\u201d",
      "Castroneves will use the provisional only if he fails in traditional qualifying to claim one of the four open spots in what was supposed to be a 40-car field. If he uses it, the 41 cars will be the most in the Daytona 500 since 2015, when 43 cars was still standard.",
      "Trackhouse and Castroneves also won't receive any points or payouts if he's the 41st driver, and all drivers who finish behind him will be moved up one position in the standings.",
      "The rule has divided the field, even though it probably will come into play only at Daytona International Speedway, where nine drivers are vying for the four open spots. NASCAR's charter system guarantees entry to 36 cars every race.",
      "\u201cAside from the Daytona 500, we don\u2019t get in a spot very often where drivers of that caliber are going home,\" Tyler Reddick said. \"I don\u2019t know where to fall on this. On one hand, I would hate for a guy like Lewis Hamilton to come over here and attempt to start the 500... (and) something keeps him from running the race. We also don\u2019t just want to let them have a spot in the race \u2014 like, they have to earn it.\u201d",
      "Logically, if multiple drivers had requested the provisional, the most sense would have been for it to go to the highest qualifier.",
      "Nope.",
      "If NASCAR does receive multiple requests, NASCAR will decide who the designated \u201cworld-class driver\u201d is ahead of the event. The criteria listed in the charter for the rule states \"the \u201cOpen Exemption\u201d position is intended for a driver who will significantly impact the promotion of the event and grow the prominence of the sport.",
      "In a competition briefing held for media last month, a hypothetical scenario was posed about what NASCAR would do if seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton, four-time F1 champion Max Verstappen, six-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and Johnson, who is also a NASCAR Hall of Famer, all put in a request for the same race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have that problem,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president of racing development.",
      "NASCAR could have that problem later this year when it goes to Mexico City, where several teams are exploring deals to enter Juan Pablo Montoya in the race, and who knows who could show up at a road course \u2014 Shane van Gisbergen was brought into the inaugural street race at Chicago, won it and by the end of the year had left his Australian V8 Supercars career behind for NASCAR.",
      "At Indianapolis in 2023, former F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kamui Kobayashi were both in the field, while Button was part of the same field as Kimi Raikkonen to make it two F1 world champions in the 2023 race at Circuit of the Americas.",
      "\u201cI can argue both sides of the fence. You\u2019d hate to have a Helio Castroneves, a Max Verstappen, a Lewis Hamilton or someone come in to run a race and then miss the show due to something silly,\u201d Chase Elliott said. \"So I can certainly see that aspect of it from a promoter. But I also think that with prestigious races, there should be some sort of integrity in making the show.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s part of what makes the race prestigious. You know, it\u2019s a hard event to make. I think you see that with the Indianapolis 500, or you see that at the Chili Bowl, right? It\u2019s a hard race to make. It\u2019s a big deal just to get into the show. I just don\u2019t want to ever degrade or hurt the long-term integrity of the sport and take the prestige out of events that should be some of our biggest days of the year.\u201d",

The Raiders did it again four years later when Tom Flores and Jim Plunkett led them past the Eagles in Super Bowl 15.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk contest days were done. He'd been in the contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend twice, won it both times with plenty of flair and figured there was nothing else to prove.",
      "Then a week later, he found himself practicing new dunks. And that's when he quickly realized that he has one \u2014 and he insists, only one \u2014 dunk contest left in him.",
      "\u201cI love the contest, man,\" McClung said. \u201cIt'd be an action in fear not to do it again. So, I'll do it \u2014 one last time.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-2 McClung \u2014 a standout guard in the G League who has appeared in only five NBA games \u2014 is headed back to All-Star weekend, looking to become the first person to win the league's dunk title in three consecutive years. Nate Robinson is the only three-time dunk champion, though his didn't come in back-to-back-to-back years.",
      "McClung breathed new life into the dunk contest and got rave reviews from some of the NBA's biggest names when he first won it in 2023, then went airborne over Shaquille O'Neal to win it again last year. Now he goes for three in a row in San Francisco on Saturday night, with San Antonio rookie Stephon Castle, Chicago rookie Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee second-year wing Andre Jackson Jr. providing the competition.",
      "\u201cI'm not going there to lose,\u201d Buzelis said.",
      "Added Jackson: \u201cI just want to be myself and put on a show.\u201d",
      "Castle is confident as well, though acknowledged he expects to feel some nerves on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI get nervous for most games,\u201d Castle said. \u201cI think it's just going to be another event for me.\u201d",
      "When this weekend is over, they'll all head back to their NBA jobs. McClung, for now, continues to wait for a real opportunity.",
      "His five NBA games have come with four NBA teams \u2014 one with Chicago, one with the Los Angeles Lakers, two with Philadelphia and one with Orlando. He's scored 33 points in those games, 20 coming in one contest with the 76ers at Brooklyn on April 9, 2023.",
      "He hasn't scored an NBA point since that day.",
      "\u201cThe easy answer is opportunity,\" McClung said. \u201cIt's not just Mac McClung. There's a lot of G League guys that can play in the league. There\u2019s a lot of guys I\u2019ve seen in the G League and then they get an opportunity in the (NBA) and people are like, \u2018Man, he got so much better this last year.' And I'm like, \u2018No, he\u2019s been good.' I really have my faith in God, and believe I\u2019m always right where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d",
      "For now, that's with the Osceola Magic. He's on a two-way contract with Orlando, and McClung is averaging 24.5 points and 6.1 assists during this G League regular season. He's been rookie of the year, he's been a G League champion and this season he's the reigning G League MVP.",
      "\u201cI take pride in the G League,\u201d McClung said. \u201cEach year it's so hard because when you're on a two-way people are like \u2018Be ready, stay ready.\u2019 But I'm trying to win in the G League. That's important to me. Winning a championship is always the standard and hopefully we can do that this year in Osceola and apply even more pressure.\u201d",
      "Winning back-to-back dunk contests has brought a ton of notoriety. People recognize McClung more now, but he hasn't changed. He's comfortable in jeans and T-shirts, drives a Ford Bronco, has the same group of friends that will smack him back in line if he gets out of line. He's proud to be the small-town kid from Gate City, Virginia \u2014 who just happens to be able to jump higher than most people and has become one of the most famous dunkers in the world.",
      "He's been offered chances to play in Europe for bigger money than he's making in the G League, too. But the dream remains the NBA, and McClung isn't ready to give up on it. He's always been the underdog and typically has found a way to turn his hopes into reality.",
      "\u201cIt's funny. I don\u2019t even look at myself as a dunker,\" McClung said. \u201cThe people that know me best know I'm a competitor first. Obviously, I haven\u2019t made an impact in the league yet or anything like that, but that\u2019s who I want to be and where I want to be. That\u2019s truly where my heart is.\u201d",
      "He'll be back on the NBA stage on Saturday, with a shot at dunking his way into history.",

      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria (AP) \u2014 Lindsey Vonn acknowledged that \u201cI didn\u2019t help myself\u201d by firing back on social media after learning that she wasn\u2019t paired with Mikaela Shiffin for Tuesday\u2019s team combined race at the skiing world championships.",
      "The 40-year-old Vonn had campaigned to race with Shiffrin in a skiing \u201cdream team\u201d for the new event, which will also make its Olympic debut next year.",
      "When Vonn saw Shiffrin announce on Instagram that she was racing with recently-crowned downhill world champion Breezy Johnson, Vonn reacted with displeasure on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d Vonn wrote Monday on X with a shrug emoji, before deleting her post and adding another.",
      "\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t help myself or the team by having my Twitter fingers out,\u201d Vonn said Tuesday. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m a human being and I was disappointed in the communication. And I let my feelings be known. I\u2019m a human. I have feelings. So shoot me.\u201d",
      "The new combined event entails one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom, with the times of the two added together to determine the final results.",
      "Vonn placed a distant 21st in the downhill portion, leaving her American teammate AJ Hurt a big gap to make up.",
      "Lauren Macuga, another American, led the downhill portion, while Johnson was fourth.",
      "Vonn placed one position above Andorra\u2019s Cande Moreno in a field of 26 starters \u2014 2.51 seconds behind Macuga",
      "\u201cI was in my tuck pretty much the whole way down and just not accelerating anywhere,\u201d said Vonn, who returned this season after nearly six years of retirement. \u201cSo I have clearly work to do. I think it\u2019s my boots that I have to play with to figure out what\u2019s better \u2026 but it\u2019s hard to really change your entire setup while you\u2019re racing in the world championships.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have a problem with the selection process,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt was 100% the right decision. Breezy and Mikaela should be the pair.",
      "\"They\u2019re the fastest two skiers \u2026 my only problem was that it wasn\u2019t communicated to me. I found out about it on Instagram. And I just think it\u2019s a little unprofessional.

      "Vonn said she reached out and that Shiffrin agreed it would be great to race together. But then Vonn was told that Shiffrin wasn\u2019t entering the combined. Vonn only learned of Shiffrin\u2019s final decision to race it via Instagram.",

    "summary": "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
    "story": [
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call. Rick Barry and Bob Cousy each fouled out of All-Star Games twice, the only players who can say that. Dwyane Wade was whistled for the first flagrant All-Star foul after breaking Kobe Bryant\u2019s nose.",
      "As the story goes, Wade called Bryant not long after that 2012 game and attempted to apologize. Turned out, there was no need. Wade\u2019s recollection of what Bryant said? \u201cBro, I love it,\u201d Wade said in a conversation with Kevin Garnett, a clip that has been a social media standard ever since.",
      "The NBA doesn't want coaches to get kicked out, anyone to get into foul trouble or anyone getting hurt. But they've asked, begged and pleaded for years with players in an effort that the All-Star Game get taken more seriously. And the latest solution is a radical one: a mini-tournament.",
      "Welcome to an All-Star format like none other: three games, no clock, first team to 40 points wins, eight-man rosters, and there's a reasonable chance that the team leaving San Francisco on Sunday as winners will have captured that title without having a single All-Star on its roster.",
      "\u201cWe went back to the drawing board,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.",
      "Here's the big question going into Sunday: Will it work?",
      "To be fair, there were skeptics when Silver added a play-in tournament to determine the final two playoff spots in the Eastern and Western Conferences; by all accounts, the play-in has been a smashing success. There were skeptics when Silver added an in-season tournament now called the NBA Cup; some players say they still don't totally understand the format, but the first two Cup final four weekends in Las Vegas have been big hits as well.",
      "Now, this. The NBA thinks players don't want to go to a 48-minute All-Star Game and play hard for a full game. Perfectly understandable. The proposed solution: short games, where nobody will have to play for long and there's little room for error since only 40 points are needed to win.",
      "Kevin Durant's first response? \u201cI hate it. Absolutely hate it. Terrible,\u201d the Phoenix star and 15-time All-Star said when the league announced the plan in December, though he quickly noted that his initial reaction could have been worded differently.",
      "Perhaps he could have taken the route that perennial All-Star forward Anthony Davis, then of the Los Angeles Lakers and now of the Dallas Mavericks, took when he was asked in December what he thinks of the NBA's new plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like it,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see how it goes this year and see if they change it again or not.\u201d",
      "And it could change again, possibly as early as next year.",
      "Some players want the traditional East vs. West format, although the league went back to that last year and it was a 211-186 game \u2014 all dunks and 3-pointers, pretty much \u2014 that broke records and forced the NBA to break the mold on the format.",
      "The NBA tried a target score approach; no clock in the fourth quarter and have the teams chase a set total to ensure that the game ends on a made basket. Some years it worked, some years not so much. They tried having playing captains pick the teams; again, success was mixed.",
      "Next up, the tournament. There is a prize pool of $1.8 million for the All-Star tournament. Each player on the All-Star champion team gets $125,000, each player on the runner-up team will get $50,000 and the players on the teams eliminated in the semifinals will each get $25,000.",
      "\u201cI don't know if everyone understands how this is going to go,\u201d said Miami's Tyler Herro, who'll make his All-Star debut this weekend. \u201cBut everyone will want to win.\u201d",
      "There are four teams in the tournament: three teams picked by Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley from the pool of 24 All-Stars, and the fourth will be the team that wins the Rising Stars event on Friday night. The Rising Stars players aren't All-Stars. Some aren't even in the NBA right now; there's a G League team in that event. And the Rising Stars winner could win the All-Star Game \u2014 meaning, yes, guys who aren't currently in the league could win the thing.",
      "Whichever way it shakes out, it will be a massive deviation from last year \u2014 when the East and West each scored at least 42 points in every quarter. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 50 points on his own last year; it'll take only 40 for a team to win a game this year.",
      "\u201cThem trying to shake things up is expected and makes sense,\u201d Oklahoma City All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"But at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to come down to whether the players wanting to go at it, and I would love to see that. Love to be a part of that for sure, and hopefully it happens.\u201d",
      "Heat forward Kevin Love \u2014 who proudly says he took part in All-Star Games where players were competitive and even strategized in the locker rooms before games and at halftimes \u2014 doesn't know when the All-Star Game changed.",
      "He thinks it became part of the evolution within the game; more 3-pointers are shot than ever before and that, combined with everyone just treating it like an exhibition and not Game 7 of the NBA Finals, led to the defense-optional approach the league doesn't want to see anymore.",
      "\u201cI'll tell you if this will work,\u201d Love said. \u201cI'll tell you on Sunday.\u201d",

We\u2019re going to be working with FIFA on security and our day-to-day responsibilities are to raise money to help put on the fan fests, to make sure that our security and transportation are all set and then also making sure that we\u2019re engaging with the communities to kind of explain to everyone what the benefits of this are going to be.\u201d",

      "LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The first Olympic Esports Games will be hosted in Riyadh in 2027, two years later than expected when a 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia was signed last year.",
      "The International Olympic Committee said Tuesday its founding partner for the event will be the kingdom\u2019s Esports World Cup Foundation.",
      "The first annual Esports World Cup was held last July and August in Riyadh with tens of millions of dollars in prize money paid for games including Call of Duty, Fortnite and Street Fighter.",
      "It is unclear which, if any, shooter games the IOC will allow on the Esports Olympics program, which it has repeatedly said must align with Olympic values.",

      "The 12-year deal was confirmed last July on the eve of the Paris Olympics as the latest prime sporting asset for the oil-rich kingdom to own or host. FIFA confirmed Saudi Arabia as host of the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer in December.",
      "IOC members were told in Paris the vision for the Esports Olympics was to hold it every two years starting in 2025, with \u201cphysical, simulated and electronic games\u201d included.",

      "The Daytona 500 has NASCAR\u2019s most unique \u2014 and complicated \u2014 qualifying format",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- The Daytona 500 has NASCAR\u2019s most unique \u2014 and complicated \u2014 qualifying format.",
      "And it got more convoluted this year with the largest number of entrants in a decade and a new rule that could add a 41st driver to the 40-car field.",
      "There are 36 guys already locked into Sunday\u2019s 500-mile race because their teams own charters, which guarantee them entry into every race on the Cup Series schedule. The remaining four spots are filled by non-chartered cars, often referred to as \u201copen teams.\"",
      "There are nine drivers \u2014 the most since 2015 \u2014 vying for those spots: Anthony Alfredo, Justin Allgaier, Helio Castroneves, Jimmie Johnson, Corey LaJoie, B.J. McLeod, Chandler Smith, Martin Truex Jr. and J.J. Yeley.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just seven whatevers,\" Johnson said. \"When you look through the affiliations and how those cars play out, it\u2019s going to be a very stressful qualifying.\u201d",
      "They can get into \u201cThe Great American Race\u201d two ways, with two spots going to the drivers who turn the fastest laps in qualifying Wednesday and two more spots being determined through qualifying races Thursday.",
      "Although Castroneves is driving for an open team, the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner is locked into the field through a new rule that allows NASCAR to invite a \u201cworld-class driver\u201d to each event. His Trackhouse Racing team was the only one to apply before the deadline, so he was the only driver NASCAR considered for the provisional spot.",
      "But there\u2019s a catch. If Castroneves uses the provisional, his team gets no prize money. So he will try to qualify his way in, and if he does, the Daytona 500 would be a 40-car field \u2014 and five open cars would miss the race. If he doesn\u2019t qualify, he would get in via the provisional \u2014 and the 500 would have 41 cars.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the nine, in alphabetical order:",
      "Alfredo, 25, returns to Daytona with Beard Motorsports. Alfredo finished 27th with the team last year. He has two top-10s in 41 career Cup starts. Founded by the late Mark Beard Sr., Beard Motorsports is trying to make the field for the seventh time since 2017.",
      "The reigning Xfinity Series champion will be behind the wheel for JR Motorsports\u2019 first attempt at making the Daytona 500. JRM is owned by two-time Daytona 500 winner Dale Earnhardt Jr., whose entry is being sponsored by country music star Chris Stapleton. Allgaier, 38, is winless is 82 Cup starts.",
      "Castroneves will make his NASCAR debut in the No. 91 Chevrolet regardless of how he qualifies. The 49-year-old Brazilian is one of four drivers to have won the Indy 500 four times (2001, \u201902, \u201909, \u201921). He has found success at Daytona, too, having won the 24 Hours at Daytona three times.",
      "The seven-time Cup champion and two-time Daytona 500 winner, now the majority owner of Legacy Motor Club, is entering two races this year. The 49-year-old Johnson will be attempting to make his 22nd appearance in the 500 but will have to qualify for the third straight year. Johnson's paint scheme was designed with input from NBA great Shaquille O'Neal.",
      "LaJoie, 33, is running a partial schedule for Rick Ware Racing and trying to make his ninth consecutive Daytona 500. He has three top-10 finishes in the season opener, including a career-best fourth last year.",
      "McLeod, owner and driver at Live Fast Motorsports, sold his charter for a reported $40 million to Spire Motorsports in 2023. It gave McLeod the freedom to pick and choose when and where he races, and Daytona is high on the list. The 41-year-old McLeod has five Daytona 500 starts, with a best finish of 19th.",
      "Smith is attempting to make the race with Garage 66, replacing Mike Wallace in the No. 66 Ford. Smith, who is slated to drive a full Truck Series schedule, last tried (and failed) to make the 500 in 2023 with Kaulig Racing. The 22-year-old Smith has started three Cup races, including a 15th-place showing in the 2023 summer race.",
      "Truex retired from full-time competition last season, but the 2017 Cup champion entered the race with TRICON Garage. His No. 56 Toyota is getting technical support from Joe Gibbs Racing. Truex, 45, is winless in 20 Daytona 500 starts but came home second in 2016 in one of the closest finishes in NASCAR history.",
      "Yeley is trying to make his sixth Daytona 500 and first since 2015. The 48-year-old driver is winless in 386 Cup starts and is partnering with NY Racing Team to pilot the No. 44 Chevrolet.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Education Department is scrapping last-minute guidance issued by the Biden administration that threatened to upend colleges\u2019 plans to pay athletes for their name, image and likeness by making those payments subject to federal Title IX rules.",
      "In a move that was largely expected, President Donald Trump\u2019s education officials announced the change Wednesday, saying the memo from former President Joe Biden\u2019s final days in office had no legal basis under Title IX, the 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education.",
      "\u201cThe NIL guidance, rammed through by the Biden Administration in its final days, is overly burdensome, profoundly unfair and it goes well beyond what agency guidance is intended to achieve,\u201d said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights.",
      "A Jan. 16 memo from the Biden administration told universities that NIL payments must be treated the same as athletic financial aid such as scholarships. It sent athletic departments across the country back to the drawing board.",
      "Football and men's basketball players were expected to receive the bulk of the $20.5 million that athletic departments will be allowed to distribute starting next school year. Universities had to figure out whether they needed to change plans to avoid running afoul of the Biden policy, which said NIL payments \u201cmust be made proportionately available to male and female athletes.\u201d",
      "Passed in 1972, Title IX requires that schools pay out financial assistance in proportion to the number of students of each gender who play sports on campus. It also calls for schools to provide opportunities to play varsity sports in proportion to the gender distribution on campus.",
      "Attorneys differed on whether the Biden memo placed the scheduled April 7 approval of the House settlement, which dictates the financial boundaries for the NIL payments, in jeopardy.",
      "Trump\u2019s education officials said such a sweeping change would require \u201cclear legal authority\u201d that does not exist.",
      "\u201cEnacted over 50 years ago, Title IX says nothing about how revenue-generating athletics programs should allocate compensation among student athletes,\u201d Trainor said.",
      "It's the second time in eight days the Trump administration has used Title IX to advance its priorities. Last week's executive order banning transgender athletes from competing in girls and women's sports was also a Title IX move. It gives federal agencies the ability to ensure schools that receive federal funding abide by the administration's views on the law.",

      "\u201cI have been knocked down more times than I can count. But I have never stayed down,\u201d Khelif said late Tuesday on her Instagram account.",
      "The IBA said this week it will file criminal complaints against the International Olympic Committee in the U.S., France and Switzerland. The Swiss-based IOC allowing female boxers Khelif and Lin Yu-ting to compete and win gold medals in Paris last year \u201cmay serve as grounds for criminal prosecution,\u201d the IBA claimed.",
      "Khelif responded by saying she \u201cwill take all necessary legal steps to ensure that my rights and the principles of fair competition are upheld.\"",
      "\"Those responsible of these actions must be held accountable, and we will pursue all available legal avenues to ensure that justice prevails,\" she added.",
      "The Russian-led IBA has been banished from the Olympics but it cited an executive order on transgender athletes by United States President Donald Trump to justify the criminal complaints.",
      "Khelif said the IBA has \u201cagain made baseless accusations that are false and offensive, using them to further their agenda. This is a matter that concerns not just me but the broader principles of fairness and due process in sport.\u201d",
      "The IOC has consistently said the boxers from Algeria and Taiwan, who were assigned female at birth and identify as women, complied with all the rules for the Olympic tournament. Both also competed in Tokyo in 2021 and did not win medals.",
      "Khelif and Lin were disqualified from the 2023 world championships run by the IBA, which said they failed eligibility tests.",
      "\u201cThe two female athletes mentioned by IBA are not transgender athletes,\u201d the IOC reiterated on Monday.",
      "Khelif advanced through the Olympic Games amid international scrutiny and uninformed speculation about her sex. Despite being born and raised as a woman, she found herself at the center of Western debates about gender, sex and sports after failing unspecified eligibility tests for women\u2019s competition from the IBA in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have seen adversity before,\u201d Khelif said. \u201cI have fought through every setback, every false accusation, every attempt to erase me. And I have won. Each obstacle has only strengthened my resolve. I will continue to compete with honor and integrity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court has ruled that a former lawyer for pro-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon was wrong to withhold some documents from a federal grand jury",
      "A former lawyer for pro-wrestling impresario Vince McMahon was wrong to withhold some documents from a federal grand jury as it investigated how the former WWE boss handled multimillion-dollar settlement agreements with two female employees who accused him of sexual abuse, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.",
      "Three judges on the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals in New York upheld a lower court ruling that said the documents were not protected by attorney-client privilege because of an exception for \u201ccrime or fraud.\u201d",
      "The appeals court said the lower court judge found prosecutors had reasonable grounds to believe that McMahon and his lawyer illegally \u201ccircumvented\u201d the WWE's internal controls and created false records when they concealed the employees' claims and settlement agreements from the company, and that they made false and misleading statements to the company's auditors \u2014 even though McMahon paid the settlements with funds that did not come from the company.",
      "The appellate panel said that while McMahon's lawyer submitted many materials in response to a grand jury subpoena, they also submitted a log of 208 documents that were being withheld under assertions of attorney-client privilege.",
      "Though the identities of the parties were not disclosed in the appeals court opinion, a person familiar with the matter confirmed the unnamed \u201cformer Chief Executive Officer of a \u201dpublicly traded company\" was McMahon. The person insisted on anonymity to discuss details that have not been made public.",
      "The status of the grand jury investigation was not immediately clear. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has declined to comment when asked about the investigation, which it has not publicly disclosed.",
      "Representatives for McMahon, who has denied wrongdoing, said they had no immediate comment on the court ruling. McMahon has previously suggested that he was no longer under investigation.",
      "In January, McMahon said in a statement that \u201cnearly three years of investigation by different governmental agencies\u201d into his actions had ended. The statement came as the federal Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had settled charges against McMahon over his failure to disclose the settlement agreements with the two now-former employees to WWE officials.",
      "\u201cIn the end, there was never anything more to this than minor accounting errors with regard to some personal payments that I made several years ago while I was CEO of WWE,\" the statement said. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that I can now put all this behind me.\u201d",
      "The appeals court, however, said in Monday's ruling that the case \u201cconcerns proceedings currently before a grand jury. At present, no indictments have been issued.\u201d",
      "The opinion disclosed some new details of the grand jury probe.",
      "Representatives for one of the former employees who got a settlement agreement from McMahon, Janel Grant, declined to comment Monday.",
      "McMahon resigned from WWE\u2019s parent company in January 2024 after Grant filed a federal lawsuit accusing him and another former executive of serious sexual misconduct. At the time, McMahon stepped down from his position as executive chair of the board of directors at WWE\u2019s parent company, TKO Group Holdings. He continued to deny wrongdoing following the filing of the lawsuit.",
      "McMahon stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in the lawsuit.",
      "Grant has said she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit, which alleges sexual battery and trafficking, also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.",
      "The $3 million settlement is mentioned in Monday's appellate court ruling, along with another $7.5 million settlement McMahon made with another former employee.",
      "The Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.",
      "Prosecutors served subpoenas on McMahon's lawyer, who is unnamed in court documents, and the attorney's firm in September 2023, seeking all communications between McMahon, his attorney and the law firm regarding the two former employees, according to the appellate court. The lawyer helped McMahon negotiate the settlements, the court said.",
      "When the lawyer withheld some of the documents claiming attorney-client privilege, prosecutors asked the lower court to compel production of the records \u2014 leading to the appeal decided Monday.",
      "The appellate judges wrote, \u201cBecause the settlement agreements resolving the Victims\u2019 claims were \u2018structured and negotiated ... to keep them hidden from (the Company),' the district court found that \u2019all communications about the claims and settlement agreements were made in furtherance of the criminal scheme to keep (the Company) and its auditors unaware of the allegations.'\u201d",

If you do engage, try to verify the person\u2019s identity by looking them up on the platform \u2014 check when their accounts were created or use a reverse image search on their photos. Requests for money, whether in the form of gift cards or payment apps, should also be treated with skepticism.",

      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",
      "\u201cProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\u201d Altman said.",

      "JD Vance is delivering a keynote speech on the final day of the Paris AI Summit during his first foreign trip since taking office as vice president",
      "PARIS -- JD Vance is delivering a keynote speech on Tuesday, the final day of the Paris AI Summit, marking his first foreign trip since taking office as vice president.",
      "Vance's address is expected to challenge Europe\u2019s regulatory approach to artificial intelligence and its moderation of content on Big Tech platforms, underscoring divergence between the United States and its allies on AI governance.",
      "The summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to debate AI\u2019s impact on security, economics, and governance.",
      "The differences were openly displayed at the summit: Europe seeks to regulate and invest, China expands access through state-backed tech giants, and the U.S., under President Donald Trump, champions a hands-off approach.",
      "Among the high-profile attendees is Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, reflecting Beijing\u2019s interest in shaping global AI standards.",
      "Vance has been an outspoken critic of European content moderation policies. He has suggested the U.S. should reconsider its NATO commitments if European governments impose restrictions on Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform, X. His Paris visit is also expected to include candid discussions on Ukraine, AI\u2019s role in global power shifts, and U.S.-China tensions.",
      "Concerns over AI\u2019s potential dangers have loomed over the summit, particularly as nations grapple with how to regulate a technology that is increasingly entwined with defense and warfare.",
      "\"I think one day we will have to find ways to control AI or else we will lose control of everything,\u201d said Admiral Pierre Vandier, NATO\u2019s commander who oversees the alliance\u2019s modernization efforts.",
      "Beyond diplomatic tensions, a global public-private partnership is being launched called \u201cCurrent AI,\u201d aimed at supporting large-scale AI initiatives for the public good.",
      "Analysts see this as an opportunity to counterbalance the dominance of private companies in AI development. However, it remains unclear whether the U.S. will support such efforts.",
      "Separately, a high-stakes battle over AI power is escalating in the private sector.",
      "A group of investors led by Musk \u2014 who now heads Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit behind OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attending the Paris summit, swiftly rejected the offer on X.",
      "In Beijing, officials on Monday condemned Western efforts to restrict access to AI tools, while Chinese company DeepSeek\u2019s new AI chatbot has prompted calls in the U.S. Congress to limit its use over security concerns. China promotes open-source AI, arguing that accessibility will ensure global AI benefits.",
      "French organizers hope the summit will boost investment in Europe\u2019s AI sector, positioning the region as a credible contender in an industry shaped by U.S.-China competition.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, addressing the energy demands of AI, contrasted France\u2019s nuclear-powered approach with the U.S.\u2018s reliance on fossil fuels, quipping: France won't \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d but \"plug, baby, plug.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s diplomatic tour will continue in Germany, where he will attend the Munich Security Conference and press European allies to increase commitments to NATO and Ukraine. He may also meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Vance will discuss Ukraine and the Middle East over a working lunch with Macron.",
      "Like Trump, he has questioned U.S. aid to Kyiv and the broader Western strategy toward Russia. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance is also set to meet separately with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 07:22:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine&rsquo;s mineral industry",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",

      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",

      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",

      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",

      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
      "A New Hampshire man fought for the chance at a pig kidney transplant, spending months getting into good enough shape to be part of a small pilot study of a highly experimental treatment.",
      "His effort paid off: Tim Andrews, 66, is only the second person known to be living with a pig kidney. Andrews is free from dialysis, Massachusetts General Hospital announced Friday, and recovering so well from the Jan. 25 transplant that he left the hospital a week later.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up in the recovery room, I was a new man,\u201d Andrews told The Associated Press.",
      "Andrews\u2019 surgery comes at a turning point in the quest to tell if animal-to-human transplants could help ease the shortage of donated human organs. The first four pig organ transplants \u2014 two hearts and two kidneys \u2014 were short-lived. But the fifth xenotransplant recipient, an Alabama woman not nearly as sick as prior patients, boosted the field \u2014 thriving for now 2\u00bd months after a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health in November.",
      "Doctors are moving from those one-off experiments to more formal studies. As they monitor Andrews\u2019 recovery, doctors at Mass General Brigham have Food and Drug Administration permission to perform two additional transplants in their pilot study, using gene-edited pig kidneys supplied by biotech eGenesis.",
      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents, tourists and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry.

      "Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.",
      "The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared with the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.",
      "But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates \u201can unusually large, unfavorable impact\u201d from foreign exchange rates, it said.",
      "Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.",
      "Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.",
      "Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.",
      "Sales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.",
      "Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.",
      "In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. During a call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said capital expenditures for the quarter came out to $26.3 billion, most of which was geared towards AI and AWS.",
      "\u201cWe think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cI think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.\u201d",
      "Jassy added during the call that Amazon, like many others, was \u201cimpressed\u201d by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.",
      "Amazon's quarterly report comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.",
      "Trump also threw out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.",
      "The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.",
      "Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China."

    "story": [
      "Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones under a new law restricting the use of devices in schools",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian students returned to class this week with a new task: staying away from their smartphones as a new law restricting their use in schools took effect.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed a bill in January limiting smartphone access at schools, in line with a trend seen in the U.S. and Europe. It applies to public and private schools, and applies to classrooms and the halls.",
      "Phones are still allowed for educational purposes, with the teacher\u2019s permission, and when needed for the student's accessibility and health. Schools can set their own guidelines, such as whether students can keep phones in backpacks or store them in lockers or designated baskets.",
      "Before the federal law, most of Brazil's 26 states \u2014 including Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias \u2014 had already applied some restrictions to phone use in schools. As of 2023, nearly two-thirds of Brazilian schools had some limitations, with 28% banning them entirely, according to a survey last year by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "But rules varied between states and between schools, and authorities and administrators struggled with enforcement.",
      "That may have contributed to support for federal legislation from across the political spectrum \u2014 both allies of leftist Lula and the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents wanted to ban smartphone use by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "Porto Seguro, a nearly 150-year-old private school in Sao Paulo, prohibited smartphones in classrooms last year and encouraged students to disconnect completely once a week. This year, it expanded its ban to include hallways, requiring students to keep their phones in lockers for the entire school day, including breaks.",
      "\u201cStudents were having trouble concentrating,\" school principal Meire Nocito said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere was also the issue of social isolation. Many students who used technology excessively would isolate themselves during breaks, interacting only through social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cBanning cellphone use has helped create a space for social interaction, fostering relationships and teaching students to navigate conflicts, which are a natural part of human interactions. It has been very positive,\u201d she added.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Education said in a statement Monday that the restriction aims to protect students\u2019 mental and physical health while promoting more rational use of technology.",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, which is among one of the world\u2019s highest rates of use.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by the U.N.'s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized used a U.S. Senate hearing last year to apologize to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",
      "Mariana Waetge, a 13-year-old student at Porto Seguro, has owned a smartphone for five years. She uses it to communicate with friends and family and to find entertainment on social media, especially Instagram. Being forced to stay away from her phone made her find new ways to interact with friends, improved her focus and even strengthened her relationship with her family.",
      "The restriction also helped \"include people who didn\u2019t have many friends and would use their phones to hide from making new friends or to avoid being out there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that option anymore. These people end up playing board games or reading books.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers in the House are proposing to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from U.S. government devices",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan duo in the the U.S. House is proposing legislation to ban the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek from federal devices, similar to the policy already in place for the popular social media platform TikTok.",
      "Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill., on Thursday introduced the \u201cNo DeepSeek on Government Devices Act,\" which would ban federal employees from using the Chinese AI app on government-owned electronics. They cited the Chinese government's ability to use the app for surveillance and misinformation as reasons to keep it away from federal networks.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans,\" Gottheimer said in a statement. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t risk the CCP infiltrating the devices of our government officials and jeopardizing our national security.\"",
      "The proposal comes after the Chinese software company in January published an AI model that performed at a competitive level with models developed by American firms like OpenAI, Meta, Alphabet and others. DeepSeek purported to develop the model at a fraction of the cost of its American counterparts. The announcement raised alarm bells and prompted debates among policymakers and leading Silicon Valley financiers and technologists.",
      "The churn over AI is coming at a moment of heightened competition between the U.S. and China in a range of areas, including technological innovation. The U.S. has levied tariffs on Chinese goods, restricted Chinese tech firms like Huawei from being used in government systems and banned the export of state of the art microchips thought to be needed to develop the highest end AI models.",
      "Last year, Congress and then-President Joe Biden approved a divestment of the popular social media platform TikTok from its Chinese parent company or face a ban across the U.S.; that policy is now on hold. President Donald Trump, who originally proposed a ban of the app in his first term, signed an executive order last month extending a window for a long term solution before the legally required ban takes effect.",
      "In 2023, Biden banned TikTok from federal-issued devices.",
      "\u201cThe technology race with the Chinese Communist Party is not one the United States can afford to lose,\u201d LaHood said in a statement. \u201cThis commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation will ban the app from federal workers\u2019 phones while closing backdoor operations the company seeks to exploit for access. It is critical that Congress safeguard Americans\u2019 data and continue to ensure American leadership in AI.\u201d",
      "The bill would single out DeepSeek and any AI application developed by its parent company, the hedge fund High-Flyer, as subject to the ban. The legislation includes exceptions for national security and research purposes that would allow federal employers to study DeepSeek.",
      "Some lawmakers wish to go further. A bill proposed last week by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would bar the import of export of any AI technology from China writ large, citing national security concerns."

      "Scientists say they\u2019ve cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists say they've cracked the code for boiling the perfect egg.",
      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",
      "\u201cYou could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so,\" said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",
      "\u201cYou can almost spread it, like on bread,\u201d said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II.",
      "To confirm they had cooked up something new, the researchers tested the chemical makeup of the prepared eggs and served them to a panel of eight tasters alongside traditional boiled eggs.",
      "The research was published Thursday in the journal Communications Engineering.",
      "This new technique could mean more time in the kitchen compared to a standard hard-boiled egg, said food scientist Joanne Slavin from the University of Minnesota. But the blend of textures on the tongue could be worth the extra time.",
      "\u201cThis is a slower process to get a better outcome,\u201d said Slavin, who had no role in the study.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Greece\u2019s government declared a state of emergency on Santorini on Thursday after hundreds of undersea earthquakes shook the resort island for nearly a week.",
      "The ministry of civil protection\u2019s announcement will provide authorities faster access to state resources. It follows a magnitude 5.2 tremor \u2013- the most powerful recorded since activity started on Jan. 31 \u2013- that struck late Wednesday.",
      "Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis confirmed that multiple emergency services were already mobilized to support the island.",
      "\u201cFire departments, police, coast guard, armed forces, and emergency medical services have immediately reinforced Santorini and surrounding islands with additional personnel and specialized equipment,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Despite causing minimal damage, the earthquake activity has prompted an exodus of thousands of residents and seasonal workers, mostly evacuating to the Greek mainland by ferry.",
      "Experts say the seismic activity is unrelated to volcanic activity in the Aegean Sea, but are still unable to say whether the swarm could lead up to a more powerful earthquake.",
      "\u201cWe are not yet in a position to say that we are seeing any evidence that would lead to the sequence slowly coming to a conclusion,\u201d Vassilis K. Karastathis, a seismologist and director of research at National Observatory of Athens, told reporters. \u201cWe are still in the middle of the road, we haven\u2019t seen any easing, any sign that it\u2019s heading towards a regression.\u201d",
      "The earthquake epicenters are concentrated in a growing cluster between the islands of Santorini, Anafi, Amorgos, and Ios. Experts view the underwater location as a mitigating factor, noting that it significantly reduces the potential for widespread damage compared to land-based seismic events.",
      "On Santorini, municipal crews cordoned off some areas on the island\u2019s renowned cliff top towns that were considered vulnerable to potential rock slides. Crews of engineers also inspected school buildings that have remained closed all week.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 09:19:07 -0500",
    "summary": "\"The bloodshed must stop and this war must end,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.",
    "story": [
      "Hegseth said the U.S. won't send troops to enforce any peace deal with Russia.",
      "LONDON and THE PENTAGON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared at his first meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on Wednesday to tell allies that the liberation of all Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory \"is an unrealistic objective.\"",
      "\"The bloodshed must stop and this war must end,\" Hegseth said, in one of the most detailed delineations of the Ukraine-Russia peace deal envisioned by President Donald Trump's new administration.",
      "\"President Trump has been clear with the American people -- and with many of your leaders -- that stopping the fighting and reaching an enduring peace is a top priority,\" Hegseth said at the meeting, which was led by the U.K., marking the first time the group has not convened under U.S. leadership.",
      "\"He intends to end this war by diplomacy and bringing both Russia and Ukraine to the table,\" Hegseth said. \"We will only end this devastating war and establish a durable peace by coupling allied strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield.\"",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his government in Kyiv have demanded full territorial liberation -- whether by military or diplomatic means -- per the country's internationally-recognized 1991 borders. Among Ukraine's other demands are binding Western security guarantees, ideally in the form of full NATO membership and Article Five protection.",
      "Hegseth rejected such ambitions, at least in the near term.",
      "\"We want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine, but we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\" he told allies. \"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "\"The United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement,\" Hegseth continued. \"Instead, any security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "\"If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission and they should not be covered under Article Five,\" he added. \"There also must be robust international oversight of the line of contact.\"",
      "\"To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Trump has repeatedly vowed to end the war by forcing both Moscow and Kyiv back to the negotiating table after nearly three years of full-scale war.",
      "Hegseth suggested that Trump's domestic energy policies would help pressure the Kremlin. \"Lower energy prices coupled with more effective enforcement of energy sanctions will help bring Russia to the table,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth delivered a broader warning to European allies of a lighter U.S. footprint on the continent. They, he said, will need to \"provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine.\"",
      "He said the \"stark strategic realities\" of competition with China in the Indo-Pacific and the U.S. focus on securing its domestic borders \"prevent the United States of America from being primarily focused on the security of Europe.\"",
      "Hegseth called on allies to donate more ammunition and equipment to Ukraine, expand their industrial bases and explain to citizens that the Russian threat necessitates \"spending more on defense and investing strategically.\"",
      "That will include increasing defense spending beyond the 2% of GDP target agreed by allies in 2014. The threshold -- which many NATO allies have still not achieved -- \"is not enough,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"President Trump has called for 5% and I agree,\" he added. \"Increasing your commitment to your own security is a down payment for the future.\"",
      "The defense secretary warned that while the U.S. \"remains committed to the NATO alliance and to partnership with Europe,\" America \"will no longer tolerate an imbalanced relationship which encourages dependency.\"",
      "\"Rather, our relationship will prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security,\" he added. \"Honesty will be our policy going forward.\"",
      "In response to Hegseth's remarks, British Defense Secretary John Healey said, \"We hear you.\"",
      "\"We hear your commitment to NATO, to Article Five, to a sovereign Ukraine and to your defense partnership with Europe,\" Healey said. \"We also hear your concerns.\"",
      "\"On stepping up for Ukraine, we are and we will,\" Healey continued. \"On stepping up for European security, we are and we will.\"",
      "\"You've just spoken about peace through strength,\" Healey said. \"We are 50 nations strong here, all determined to put an end to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war, to do so together.\"",

    "story": [
      "Over 190 House and Senate Democrats joined a letter vowing to protect CFPB",
      "A group of 191 House and Senate Democrats sent a letter to Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, calling on them to reverse course on actions targeting the nation's consumer financial watchdog agency.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices. It has been brought to a virtual standstill after Vought, who last week was named the agency's acting director, and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency took control of the agency. Vought has since issued a stop-work order to nearly all CFPB staff.",
      "Democrats, in their letter, are calling for Musk's DOGE employees, some of whom physically accessed the agency's federal office and requested access to its industry and consumer data, to be pulled out of the CFPB.",
      "\"Your efforts to dismantle the CFPB are dangerous, and we will fight them at every turn. We ask that you remove Mr. Musk's operatives from the CFPB, restore all internal and external systems and operations, and allow the CFPB to continue to do its job of protecting American consumers,\" the Democrats wrote in their letter.",
      "The letter is signed by all Senate Democrats and the two independents -- Sen. Angus King, of Maine, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont -- who caucus with them.",
      "During remarks on Monday from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said the CFPB was \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"",
      "When asked if his goal was to completely get rid of the agency, Trump answered in the affirmative.",
      "\"I would say yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Trump said.",
      "Democrats in their letter allege that efforts to sideline the financial watchdog will harm consumers and are potentially illegal.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has effectively fired the financial cop on the beat and declared open season for predatory lenders and scam artists working to steal Americans' money and threaten their financial security,\" Democrats said in the letter.",
      "\"No matter how badly someone has been cheated and no matter how extensive the scam, the Administration has declared that the financial cops should simply stand by and watch while giant networks of lenders cheat American consumers,\" the letter continued. \"This is particularly costly for people whose claims of illegal foreclosures, car repossessions, or debanking are currently under investigation by the agency.\"",
      "The letter comes as congressional Democrats, who are in the minority in both the House and the Senate, have vowed to use their limited tools to challenge what they say is illegal overreach by the Trump administration and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency across a number of agencies, including USAID, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Institutes of Health and the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union filed two lawsuits this week against Vought, challenging both the takeover of the CFPB and DOGE's access to its records.",
      "The letter is led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who is the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and helped create the CFPB after the 2008 financial crash. In the days since Elon Musk posted \"RIP CFPB\" on X, Warren has been a vocal defender of the agency.",
      "Since it was established in 2011, the CFPB says it has clawed back nearly $21 billion for American consumers, addressing complaints over everything from bank fees to credit cards to student loans.",
      "On Tuesday, Warren implored Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who was appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, to work with Congress to keep Musk's team out of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "\"If the CFPB is not there examining these giant banks to make sure they are following the laws, are not cheating consumers, who is doing that job?\" Warren asked Powell during the hearing.",
      "\"I can say no other federal regulators,\" Powell replied.",
      "\"No one. In other words thanks to 'co-president' Musk and the CFPB Acting Director Vought, Wall Street banks no longer have to show the bank examiners that they're not illegally opening accounts people didn't ask for, like what happened with Wells Fargo, or charging illegal junk fees like Bank of America did,\" Warren said.",
      "But some Republicans on the panel pushed back on this line of questioning, saying laws that regulate banks haven't changed and Elon Musk is simply carrying out the work Trump promised on the campaign.",
      "\"There's been a lot of conversation, both in and out of this hearing room today, conversations about a co-president, referencing Elon Musk, referencing the work that DOGE is doing,\" said Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt. \"I think it's important to remember that President Trump ran on this. I mean, he said we're going to look for wasteful spending across our government.\"",
      "Democrats, in their letter, say they'll fight to defend the agency.",
      "\"We beat back all prior efforts to gut this agency, and we will fight this latest attack in Congress, the courts, and the public,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"It will fail.\"",

      "Treasury Department officials said the \"error\" was quickly corrected, and a forensic investigation into the actions of Marko Elez -- who resigned from his position last week after The Wall Street Journal unearthed a series of racist social media posts -- remains ongoing.",
      "\"To the best of our knowledge, Mr. Elez never knew of the fact that he briefly had read/write permissions for the [Secure Payment System] database, and never took any action to exercise the 'write' privileges in order to modify anything within the SPS database -- indeed, he never logged in during the time that he had read/write privileges, other than during the virtual walk-through -- and forensic analysis is currently underway to confirm this,\" wrote Joseph Gioeli III, a deputy commissioner at Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The high-profile mistake at BFS -- which effectively serves as the federal government's checkbook by disbursing more than $5 trillion annually -- comes as a federal judge in New York is weighing whether to continue to block individuals associated with Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Treasury Department records.",
      "Lawyers with the Department of Justice initially insisted that Elez was strictly given \"read-only\" access to sensitive records, but the affidavits submitted by BFS employees on Tuesday noted that the 25-year-old was inadvertently given the ability to \"read/write\" the sensitive system that agencies use to send \"large dollar amount transactions\" to the Treasury Department.",
      "According to Gioeli, Treasury Department officials also provided Elez with copies of the \"source code\" for multiple payment systems that he could edit in a digital \"sandbox.\"",
      "\"Mr. Elez could review and make changes locally to copies of the source code in the cordoned-off code repository; however, he did not have the authority or capability to publish any code changes to the production system or underlying test environments,\" the filing said.",
      "Elez resigned from his role on Feb. 6, and Gioielli claimed that the 25-year-old former SpaceX and X employee was the \"only individual on the Treasury DOGE Team\" who was given direct access to payment systems or source code. A \"preliminary review\" of his digital activity suggests that Elez stayed within the permitted bounds of his role when accessing the payment systems.",

      "In a court filing Monday night, Justice Department lawyers acknowledged making two significant errors last week during a court hearing about the dismantling of the foreign aid agency USAID. While DOJ attorneys last week claimed that 500 employees at USAID had been put on leave and that only future contracts had been put on pause, more than 2,100 employees had actually been placed on leave while both future and existing contracts were frozen, according to the filing.",
      "\"Defendants sincerely regret these inadvertent misstatements based on information provided to counsel immediately prior to the hearing and have made every effort to provide reliable information in the declaration supporting their opposition to a preliminary injunction,\" DOJ lawyers wrote to the judge overseeing the case.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:26:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk had not faced reporters since taking the lead on Trump's mandate to dismantle much of the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Musk was asked if any checks exist for his role or if he's \"policing\" himself.",
      "Elon Musk joined President Donald Trump in the Oval Office on Tuesday, where he addressed reporters for the first time amid his aggressive cost-cutting efforts across the federal government.",
      "Musk defended the Department of Government Efficiency as Trump asked him to speak about the team's work. The Tesla billionaire brought his young son \"X\" and wore a black coat and \"Make America Great Again\" hat.",
      "\"If there's not a good feedback loop from the people to the government and if you have rule of the bureaucrat, or if the bureaucracy is in charge, then what meaning does democracy actually have?\" said Musk, who is an unelected official himself.",
      "Musk had not faced questions since taking the lead on Trump's mandate to slash or even dismantle some federal agencies. The White House has said he is classified as a \"special government employee\" but it's unclear to whom he is accountable, other than Trump.",
      "ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott pressed Musk on what accountability he faces and whether he is \"policing\" himself. Musk in response claimed DOGE's actions are \"maximally transparent.\"",
      "While Musk and his DOGE have been posting about some of its activities on social media, the information is often vague and doesn't include many specifics about what Musk repeatedly claims is widespread corruption and fraud to justify his actions.",
      "ABC's Scott followed up by asking about potential conflict of interests, as his reporting shows his own firms have received billions of dollars in government contracts.",
      "\"Well, all of our actions are fully public,\" Musk said. \"So, if you see anything you say like, wait a second, hey, you know what that does? That seems like maybe that's, you know, that there's a conflict there. It\u2019s not like people are going to be shy about saying that. They'll say it immediately.\"",
      "Trump jumped in to say that if his administration thought there was a conflict, \"we would not let him do that segment or look in that area.\"",
      "Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order directing federal agencies to coordinate with DOGE to \"shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions,\" according to a White House fact sheet.",
      "Musk said DOGE's aim is to \"rightsize\" the government. He said they were exploring federal employees who had high net worths despite low salaries, claiming without providing evidence they may be \"getting wealthier at the taxpayer expense.\"",
      "\"There needs to be a lot of people working for the federal government, but not as many as currently,\" he said.",
      "Musk also claimed DOGE's unprecedented effort to slash spending is not \"draconian or radical\" and is needed for \"America to remain solvent as a country.\" He claimed a cursory examination of Social Security showed people in the system were \"150 years old\" or had \"no identifying information.\"",
      "DOGE has faced early setbacks from the courts, with a federal judge temporarily blocking Musk and his team from accessing Treasury Department material, including sensitive information such as the Social Security numbers and bank account information of millions of Americans.",
      "The administration and some key Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have criticized the court action against DOGE. Johnson earlier Tuesday said the courts should \"step back\" and let DOGE work.",
      "Trump continued to lash out at the courts on Tuesday, saying they're trying to stop what he claims is tremendous waste inside the government -- though he didn't elaborate or provide specific examples.",
      "\"And now a judge who's an activist judge wants to try and stop us from doing this,\" Trump said. \"Why? And why would they want to do that? I campaigned on this.\"",
      "At one point, Trump said \"maybe we have to look at the judges, because that's very serious. I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "His administration's combative statements against the judiciary, including Vice President JD Vance's claim that judge's \"aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" have legal experts and scholars worried they may try to skirt court orders",
      "\"If a judge does block one of your policies, part of your agenda, will you abide by that ruling? Will you comply?\" ABC's Scott asked the president.",
      "\"Well, I always abide by the courts and then I'll have to appeal it,\" Trump said, though he went on to lament the length of the appeals process.",
      "\"I would hope that a judge, if you go into a judge and you show them, here's a corrupt situation, we have a check to be sent but we found it to be corrupt. Do you want us to send this corrupt check to a person, or do you want us not to give it and give it back to the taxpayer? I would hope a judge would say, don't send it, give it back to the taxpayer,\" Trump said.",

      "Adams called the bribery case an \"unnecessary ordeal.\"",
      "In his first appearance since the Justice Department moved to drop the case against him, New York City Mayor Eric Adams celebrated the end of what he called an \"unnecessary ordeal.\"",
      "\"As I said from the outset, I never broke the law, and I never would. I would never put any personal benefit above my solemn responsibility as your mayor,\" Adams said during a public address Tuesday. He did not take questions.",
      "In a letter Monday night, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove instructed federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to drop the bribery case against Adams.",
      "Adams pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment that accused him of accepting years of luxury travel gifts in exchange for, among other things, persuading the fire department to approve the opening of the new Turkish consulate in Manhattan despite the lingering safety concerns of inspectors.",
      "Addressing the public on Tuesday, Adams decried what he called \"sensational and false claims\" against him, despite the case's dismissal not involving any proclamation of his innocence.",
      "The directive from Bove made no assessment on the strength of the evidence against Adams.",
      "Rather, Bove's letter questioned the timing of when the charges were brought, suggesting the case was part of the Biden administration\u2019s weaponization of the Justice Department.",
      "Bove also said the case adversely affected Adams\u2019 ability to help the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning it could come up again. However, Bove said nothing could happen until after this year\u2019s mayoral election.",
      "Addressing New Yorkers on Tuesday, Adams denied ever committing a crime and touted his record as mayor.",
      "\"I never asked anyone to break the law on my behalf or on behalf of my campaign -- never -- and I absolutely never traded my power as an elected official for any personal benefit,\" he said.",
      "Adams thanked the Justice Department for its \"honesty.\"",
      "\"Now we can put this cruel episode behind us and focus entirely on the future of our city,\" he said. \"It's time to move forward.\"",
      "Adams is the first New York City mayor to ever face criminal charges.",
      "The dropping of the case comes after Adams has publicly cozied up to Trump, spending time with him at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and attending his inauguration.",
      "Trump recently made comments in support of Adams, and has suggested he would \"take a look\" at pardoning him.",
      "\"I think that he was treated pretty unfairly,\" Trump said regarding Adams during in a December press briefing.",
      "New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams -- who, if Adams were to resign, would become acting mayor -- hit back against Adams' public address in a statement, saying he is \"trying to sell misinformation to a city he\u2019s already decided to sell out.\"",
      "\"The mayor is simply lying to New Yorkers -- the good news is, he\u2019s never given them a reason to believe him before, so I hope they don\u2019t start now,\" Williams said.",
      "Williams emphasized that the case being dropped in no way proves Adams' innocence, slamming the move as a \"purely a political favor to a man who can now be leveraged and threatened.\"",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a mayor who cares enough to be honest about his case or his inability to lead -- the truth is, we barely have a mayor at all,\" Williams said. \"I would call for the mayor to resign, but that would mean him putting the interests of the city first. At this point it is beyond clear that he can't or doesn't care enough to, and that should anger every New Yorker.\""

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s longstanding bonhomie with President Donald Trump may be tested as the Indian leader kicks off a visit to Washington, eager to avoid tariffs that have been slapped on others and threats of further taxes and imports",
      "NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s longstanding bonhomie with President Donald Trump could be tested as the Indian leader kicks off a visit to Washington on Wednesday, eager to avoid tariffs that have been slapped on others and threats of further taxes and imports.",
      "India, a key strategic partner of the United States, has so far been spared any new tariffs, and the two leaders have cultivated a personal relationship. Modi \u2014 a nationalist criticized over India\u2019s democratic backsliding \u2014 has welcomed Trump's return to the White House, seeking to reset India\u2019s relationship with the West over his refusal to condemn Russia for its war on Ukraine.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly referred to India as a \u201ctariff king\u201d and pressed the South Asian country on the deportation of migrants. In response, New Delhi has shown a willingness to lower its own tariffs on U.S. products, accept Indian citizens back and buy American oil.",
      "But as tariff threats loom, the question remains how much a good rapport between two leaders matters and how far India will go to cut a deal.",
      "Modi had established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office, and the two can build on the areas of convergence and \u201cminimize areas of friction without conceding on core areas of national interest,\u201d says Meera Shankar, India\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S.",
      "\u201cMost other partners have their reciprocal lists ready from the word go, because it\u2019s a point of leverage when you negotiate,\" Shankar added, expressing hope that India \u201cwill find the right balance between firmness and flexibility\u201d on the tariffs issue.",
      "Modi \u2014 boosted by his ruling Hindu nationalist party's victory in the high-stakes state legislature election last weekend in India\u2019s federal territory, including New Delhi \u2014 said before leaving for Washington that the visit was an \u201copportunity to build upon\" collaboration during Trump's first term and \u201cdeepen our partnership\u201d in areas such as technology, trade, defense and energy.",
      "Speaking with Modi in January, Trump emphasized the importance of India buying more American-made military gear and weapons, as well as reducing the trade imbalance. Last year, the U.S. imported $50 billion more in goods than it sold to India.",
      "A readout from the White House at the time said Trump \"emphasized the importance of India increasing its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, India accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane, the first such flight to the country as part of a crackdown ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Also, Modi's government lowered some high tariffs, including on some Harley-Davidson motorcycles, from 50% to 40%. In 2023, India had dropped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils, and walnuts.",
      "\u201cAnother thing we can expect is that Modi would offer to purchase more American (natural) gas to narrow the U.S. trade deficit,\" said Lisa Curtis, director of the Indo-Pacific security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThis will help a little bit.\u201d",
      "India is seen as integral to the U.S. strategy of containing China in the Indo-Pacific and is to host a summit of a group of countries known as the Quad \u2014 made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014 later this year.",
      "But India will likely have to recalibrate its stand in case of a Washington-Beijing thaw under Trump.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s outreach to China will complicate India\u2019s ability to cultivate the American desire to use India as a proxy against China without actually ever becoming one,\u201d said Happymon Jacob, founder of the New Delhi-based Council for Strategic and Defense Research.",
      "India turned the page with China and in December agreed to work toward a solution to their long-running border dispute in the Himalayas after a military standoff that began with a deadly clash in 2020.",
      "\u201cEven a tactical accommodation between the U.S. and China has implications for India,\u201d Shankar said.",
      "The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trade partner, with a trade deficit of $50 billion in India\u2019s favor. The Indo-U.S. goods and services trade totaled around $190.1 billion in 2023. According to India\u2019s External Affairs Ministry, the U.S. exports to India were worth nearly $70 billion and imports $120 billion.",
      "India depends on Russia for nearly 60% of its defense equipment, but the war in Ukraine has added to doubts about future supplies, and New Delhi has been looking more toward the U.S., Israel, Britain, and others.",
      "A recently struck deal will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with India-based Hindustan Aeronautics to produce jet engines for Indian aircraft in India and the sale of U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones.",
      "Since 2008, India has contracted over $20 billion worth of U.S.-origin defense equipment.",
      "\u201cFor India, that could also be an area where we see some synergies with the U.S.,\u201d Shankar said, adding that Trump will likely seek to persuade India to buy more defense equipment.",
      "Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore, said Modi's visit will be a good time to advance Indo-U.S. ties.",

      "The U.N. human rights office estimates that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister",
      "GENEVA -- The U.N. human rights office on Wednesday estimated that up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks last summer in a crackdown on student-led protests against the now-ousted former prime minister.",
      "In a new report, the Geneva-based office says security and intelligence services \u201csystematically engaged\u201d in rights violations that could amount to crimes against humanity and require further investigation.",
      "Citing \u201cvarious credible sources,\u201d the rights office said it estimated that as many as 1,400 people may have been killed in the protests between July 15 and Aug. 5 \u2014 the day longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India amid the uprising.",
      "Thousands more were injured in the weeks leading up to and after the protests, and the vast majority of those killed and injured \u201cwere shot by Bangladesh\u2019s security forces,\u201d the report said.",
      "Over 11,700 people were detained, the report said, citing information from security services. It said that about 12 to 13% of people estimated to have be killed \u2014- or as many as about 180 people \u2014 were children.",
      "In some cases, \u201csecurity forces engaged in summary executions by deliberately shooting unarmed protesters at point blank range,\u201d it said.",
      "U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk cited signs that \u201cextrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture\u201d were conducted with the knowledge and coordination of the political leadership and top security officials as a way to suppress the protests.",
      "The U.N. fact-finding team was deployed to Bangladesh at the invitation of the country's interim leader, the Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to look into the uprising and violent crackdown.",
      "The team of investigators said the interim government has reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with attacks on religious and indigenous groups. The report said \u201cmany perpetrators of acts of revenge, violence and attacks on distinct groups apparently continue to enjoy impunity.\u201d",
      "The human rights situation in Bangladesh continues to raise concerns, the U.N. office said.",
      "While the government has changed, \u201cthe system has not necessarily changed,\" Rory Mungoven, head of the rights office's Asia-Pacific region, told reporters. \"Many officials and people who had served or been appointed under the previous regime continue to function,\u201d he said.",
      "Such a situation creates \u201ca potential conflict of interest\u201d and could impede reforms and accountability, Mungoven added.",
      "The investigators issued dozens of recommendations to the government, such as steps to improve the justice system and setting up a witness protection program. It also recommended banning the use of lethal firearms by security forces to disperse crowds unless they are faced with \u201cimminent threat of death or serious injury.\u201d",
      "What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party.",
      "A High Court decision in early June that reinstated the quota system was the \u201cimmediate trigger\u201d to the protests, which were also fueled by long standing grievances about economic inequality and a lack of rights, the report said."

      "A judge has ordered Louisiana State University to fully reinstate a professor who was removed from his teaching duties last month after he used vulgar language to criticize Gov. Jeff Landry and President Donald Trump during a lecture",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A judge has ordered Louisiana State University to fully reinstate a professor who was removed from his teaching duties last month after he used vulgar language to criticize Gov. Jeff Landry and President Donald Trump during a lecture.",
      "The ruling, which allows tenured law professor Ken Levy to return to his classroom this week, was issued following the conclusion of Tuesday's hearing over a lawsuit Levy filed against the university. During two days of testimony, law students and another professor spoke about the \u201cchilling effect\u201d Levy's removal had on them and that it exacerbated fears over speaking freely in the classroom.",
      "\u201cEveryone was vulnerable if I lost this,\u201d Levy said outside of the Baton Rouge courthouse Tuesday night, specifically speaking about other university faculty members and students. \u201cSo my win is their win.\u201d",
      "The legal battle stems from an anonymous student complaint pertaining to what the professor said on the first day of a criminal justice course in January.",
      "A transcript of a recording taken in the class, shared in court and published by The Advocate, showed that Levy said \u201cf(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk) the governor\u201d as well as told students he could put them in jail if they broke his no-recording policy. Levy said that the comments were made in a \u201cjoking manner\u201d and multiple students who testified also interpreted it as humor.",
      "Additionally, Levy \u2014 who told students he was a Democrat \u2014 used the expletive to talk about Trump, referring to the November presidential election and saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that f(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk)r won.\u201d",
      "Within a few days, university administration informed Levy he had been relieved from his teaching responsibilities \u201cpending an investigation into student complaints of inappropriate statements made in your class,\u201d according to Levy's lawsuit.",
      "Levy's attorney, Jill Craft, said that the professor's removal violated his academic freedom and lacked his right to due process. Jimmy Faircloth, Jr., an attorney representing the university, argued that initial findings showed Levy had created a classroom environment that could be demeaning to some students, specifically those who don't share the same political views as the professor. Faircloth also said that the lawsuit was premature, as Levy was only removed from his classroom \u2014 but still being paid and allowed to be on campus \u2014 as a full investigation continued.",
      "In his ruling from the bench on Tuesday night, 19th Judicial District Judge Tarvald Smith said he saw no problem with Levy's vulgarity under the context presented and that negative comments about politicians are \u201ca way of life.\u201d",
      "Additionally, Smith said he hopes the state-funded university will allow professors to \u201cinvite rigorous debate and dialogue\u201d to prepare law students who are going into a career field where they will face opposing opinions every day.",
      "\u201cYour client should get back to the business of training lawyers and let professors teach,\u201d Smith told Faircloth.",
      "Throughout the hearing, one name repeatedly mentioned was Gov. Landry, a Republican and ally of Trump's. Since taking office last year, Landry has made national news for his sweeping conservative agenda, which includes a law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in every public classroom, a Texas-style immigration measure, expansion of death row execution methods and a measure classifying abortion pills as dangerous controlled substances.",
      "Last November, Landry publicly called on Louisiana State University to discipline another law professor, Nicholas Bryner, who during a lecture criticized Trump and students who voted for him. Bryner remains employed by the school. Levy cited that particular situation as a reason for his no-recording policy in class.",
      "In Levy's case, Landry also took to X, saying the professor's conduct \u201cshould not be tolerated.\u201d Levy testified that he received death threats following the governor's post.",
      "Landry\u2019s office did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday.",
      "While it has been questioned by some residents, students and Levy's attorney if the governor played any role in the professor\u2019s removal, Faircloth said that is \u201ca conspiratorial narrative\u201d and there was \u201cno political motivation.\u201d",
      "University President William Tate IV testified on Tuesday, that it was solely his decision to remove Levy, adding that he \u201cnever talked to the governor about this matter.\u201d Tate said he reviewed a transcript of what Levy said and felt the \u201ctotality of it was over the line of what I would expect to see in a classroom.\u201d",
      "Other\u2019s continue to have worries that their lectures may be scrutinized, especially if they oppose the views of a sitting elected official. Among those with trepidation is Professor Patrick Martin IV, who teaches jurisprudence and says he may discuss Louisiana's new embattled Ten Commandments requirement.",
      "\u201cIs it possible I\u2019m going to be suspended?,\" Martin asked in court. \"That\u2019s a real fear.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s just going to depend on where those temperatures go,\u201d Williams said. \u201cRain can clear things off. And rain can also freeze. And then you have a lot of skating rinks instead of roads.\u201d",
      "An Arctic air mass stretched from Portland, Oregon, to the Great Lakes.",

      "In his own words, author Salman Rushdie describes the moments when a stranger rushed at him on stage in western New York and began attacking him",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- Author Salman Rushdie testified Tuesday in the trial of a man accused of attacking him with a knife just after he took his seat for a panel discussion at the Chautauqua Institution in western New York.",
      "The noted author was on the witness stand for just about an hour, during which he described the 2022 assault in front of a shocked audience in precise detail. He also told some jokes with the comfort of someone experienced at public speaking.",
      "The man accused in the attack, Hadi Matar, was grabbed by bystanders and arrested. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Following are highlights of Rushdie's testimony:",
      "\u201cBefore we were able to start having the conversation we were going to have, I was aware of this person rushing at me from my righthand side,\" Rushdie said. \u201cI only saw him at the last minute. I was aware of someone wearing black clothes, or dark clothes and a black face mask.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was very struck by his eyes, which were dark and seemed very ferocious to me,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cInitially he hit me very hard,\u201d Rushdie said. \u201cI thought he was hitting me with his fist, but I saw a large quantity of blood pouring onto my clothes. He was hitting me repeatedly. Hitting and slashing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was struggling to get away from him and I was struck a number of times more on my chest and torso and around my waist,\u201d the author said. \"I was trying to get to my feet, out of the chair, and get away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen there were a number of blows to my chest and torso. Three stab wounds down the center of my chest,\u201d he said, adding there were also injuries to his waist area. While lying on the stage, Rushdie recalled \u201ca sense of great pain and shock and aware of the fact that there was an enormous quantity of blood that I was lying in.\"",
      "\u201cIt was a stab wound in my eye and intensely painful, and after that, I was screaming because of the pain and I couldn\u2019t see out of the eye any more,\" Rushdie said.",
      "\u201cIt occurred to me that I was dying. That was my predominant thought.\u201d",
      "Defense lawyer Lynn Shaffer got a chance to question Rushdie about the attack.",
      "\u201cI believe you said you are a writer,\u201d she began.",
      "Later she asked Rushdie if he\u2019d be surprised that \u2019Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary,\u201d in which he makes a cameo, was her favorite movie.",
      "\u201cI am surprised,\u201d Rushdie said, joking that it was \u201cmy most important work.\u201d",
      "The only hint at a possible defense strategy was a question about whether trauma can affect memories.",
      "Rushdie acknowledged that he has a false memory, that he thought he stood up when he saw the attacker approaching, but that wasn\u2019t true.",
      "She then challenged him to remember how many times he was struck.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t counting at the time. I was otherwise occupied but afterward I could see them on my body. I didn\u2019t need to be told by anybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019m not quite at 100%. I think I\u2019ve substantially recovered but it\u2019s probably 75-80%,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019m not as energetic as I used to be. I\u2019m not as physically strong as I used to be.\u201d"

      "The Arizona Supreme Court has set a March 19 execution date for a man who pleaded guilty to murder more than 17 years ago and has said himself that his lethal injection is long overdue",
      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Supreme Court set a March 19 execution date Tuesday for a man who pleaded guilty to murder more than 17 years ago and recently said his death sentence was \u201clong overdue.\u201d It would be the state\u2019s first application of the death penalty in more than two years.",
      "The court issued an execution warrant for Aaron Brian Gunches, who was convicted in 2007 in the 2002 shooting death of Ted Price, his girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband, near the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.",
      "Gunches also shot a trooper twice when he was pulled over by the Arizona Department of Public Safety near the California border in 2003, according to authorities. A bulletproof vest saved the trooper, and bullet casings from that scene matched ones found near Price\u2019s body.",
      "In a statement, Price\u2019s sister, Karen Price, described her brother as a kind and loving person who enjoyed watching the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Diamondbacks and riding his motorcycle.",
      "Price expressed relief now that the execution warrant has been issued. Her brother\u2019s two children, teenagers at the time of his death, were forever changed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to describe how Ted\u2019s murder has devastated our family,\u201d Price said.",
      "Arizona, which has 112 prisoners on death row, last carried out three executions in 2022 following a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining drugs for execution. In one of the 2022 executions, the state was criticized for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner.",
      "The court had issued a death warrant for Gunches nearly two years ago, but the sentence wasn\u2019t carried out because the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general agreed not to pursue executions during a review of the state\u2019s death penalty protocol. The review ended in November when Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs dismissed the retired federal magistrate judge she had appointed to examine execution procedures.",
      "A spokesman said then that the review resulted in critical improvements to meet legal and constitutional standards, and that the governor \u201cremains committed to upholding the law while ensuring justice is carried out in a way that\u2019s transparent and humane.\u201d",
      "The 53-year-old Gunches, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but is representing himself, had asked the court in late December to skip legal formalities and schedule his lethal injection earlier than authorities had planned, saying his death sentence was \u201clong overdue.\u201d The state Supreme Court rejected his request.",
      "There was no immediate response to phone and email messages seeking comment from Emily Skinner, an attorney who serves as Gunches\u2019 advisory counsel.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- A scruffy New Orleans rescue dog famed for evading a monthslong effort to recapture him using nets and tranquilizer rifles has finally been caught and returned to domestic life Tuesday.",
      "Scrim, a 17-pound mutt who has become a Louisiana folk hero, first escaped from his adopted family in April and roamed the city for months until he was cornered and brought back home. Weeks later, in October, he leaped out of a second-story window in a moment recorded on video that got attention online.",
      "During his months on the lam, Scrim survived a hurricane and freezing blizzard conditions. A posse of volunteers tracked his movements over 57 square miles (148 square kilometers) using wildlife surveillance cameras and a crowdsourced map of sightings.",
      "The renowned fugitive was ultimately captured in a cat trap, said Michelle Cheramie, the owner of animal rescue nonprofit Zeus' Rescues who led the mission to find Scrim. Cheramie, a former information technology professional who has devoted her life to caring for animals after losing her home during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, has said she was \u201cborn to rescue.\u201d",
      "The elated Cheramie held Scrim in arms on Tuesday after giving him a much-needed bath. The pooch appeared calm, and a vet found him in good shape. During his first time on the run last year, Scrim suffered lacerations and was founded embedded with what appeared to be small bullets.",
      "\u201cHe endured so much. I needed him safe. He is not a feral dog,\u201d Cheramie said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put him in a place where he has access to go on long walks, where he has access to vet care and he doesn\u2019t have to run and hide from loud scary noises.\u201d",
      "Volunteers who spent nights searching the city for Scrim trickled in to Cheramie's house for the chance to hold and pet the dog. They swapped stories about the long-fruitless hunt as Scrim relaxed beneath blankets on a couch.",
      "Cheramie is taking no more chances. She's carefully locked the doors and windows in her house as she waits to bring Scrim to his long-term residence with a family she declined to name. Scrim has been outfitted with a new GPS collar and an AirTag tracking device in case he escapes again.",
      "Before Scrim joins his new family, Cheramie plans to enjoy his presence.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to sleep in bed with me tonight and it\u2019s going to be the most amazing thing,\" Cheramie said. \u201cIt's so good to have him in my arms. It's everything I ever wanted.\u201d",

      "A judge has granted a $500,000 bond for the father of a 14-year-old boy who is accused of a deadly mass shooting at a Georgia high school",
      "ATLANTA -- In a rare case of a parent being charged after a school shooting, a judge on Tuesday granted a $500,000 bond for the father of a 14-year-old boy accused of a deadly attack at a north Georgia high school.",
      "Colin Gray has pleaded not guilty to 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the Sept. 4 mass shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder.",
      "Gray, 54, and his son, Colt Gray, were both indicted in the shooting that killed two students and two teachers and injured several others. Both have pleaded innocent to the charges they face.",
      "Colin Gray had given his son the assault-style weapon as a Christmas gift and was aware that the child's mental health had deteriorated in the weeks before the shooting, investigators testified at an earlier hearing. The father also was aware that his son was obsessed with school shooters and even had a shrine above his home computer for the gunman in the 2018 Parkland, Florida, school massacre, Florida, prosecutors say.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, several relatives of the dead and injured spoke, with some breaking down in tears as they described the loss of their loved one. They pleaded for the father to remain jailed without bond as he awaits trial.",
      "\u201cI feel that the sheer irresponsibility of Mr. Gray as a parent robbed my family of the chance to raise my son,\u201d said Breanna Schermerhorn, whose 14-year-old son Mason was killed in the attack.",
      "\u201cWhat you, the families, are going through, what the community is going through is undeniable pain, and I understand that,\u201d Judge Nick Primm said.",
      "\u201cThis case is an open sore, it\u2019s a wound that continues to hurt the community,\u201d he added.",
      "Colin Gray's lawyer, Jimmy Berry, said the state has not proven that the father would pose any threat if released on bond.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of the pretrial bond is not to punish him before his conviction,\" Berry said.",
      "The judge said he's constrained by the law in deciding bond. Gray is presumed innocent and the law \u201cdoes not permit me to be emotional,\" he said.",
      "Georgia law in bond cases involves weighing whether there's a risk that Gray would flee, whether he would pose a danger to the community and whether he would try to influence or threaten witnesses. There's been no evidence that any of that would occur if bond were to be granted, the judge said. Gray was ordered to have no contact with witnesses. If he's unable to post the money, then he will remain jailed.",
      "The judge said he does not believe Gray could return to Winder, a small town northeast of Atlanta, while awaiting trial. \u201cIn the court of public opinion, he bears a scarlet letter,\u201d he said.",
      "Before Primm issued his ruling, Colin Gray testified that if bond were granted, he would live with his sister in Cherokee County, about 70 miles (115 kilometers) from Winder.",
      "Colt Gray is charged as an adult and indicted on 55 counts, including murder and 25 counts of aggravated assault at the high school. His father faces 29 charges, including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Both also face multiple counts of cruelty to children.",
      "The shooting killed teachers Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14. Another teacher and eight more students were wounded, seven of them hit by gunfire.",
      "Colin Gray is the first adult known to be charged in a school shooting in Georgia. His indictment is the latest example of prosecutors holding parents responsible for their children\u2019s actions in school shootings. Michigan parents Jennifer and James Crumbley, the first to be convicted in a U.S. mass school shooting, were sentenced to at least 10 years in prison for not securing a firearm at home and acting indifferently to signs of their son\u2019s deteriorating mental health before he killed four students in 2021.",
      "Investigators have said Colt Gray carried a semiautomatic assault-style rifle onto a school bus, with the barrel sticking out of his book bag, wrapped up in a poster board. They say the boy carefully plotted the shooting at the 1,900-student high school northeast of Atlanta, drawing diagrams and listing potential body counts in a notebook. He left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the rifle before shooting people in a classroom and hallways."

      "A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully obeyed an earlier order",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected a Trump administration push to reinstate a sweeping pause on federal funding, a decision that comes after a judge found the administration had not fully obeyed an earlier order.",
      "The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals turned back the emergency appeal, the latest in a string of court losses that is increasingly frustrating top administration officials as it slows President Donald Trump\u2019s wide-ranging agenda.",
      "The appeals court also said it expected the lower court judge to clarify his original order. The Trump administration quickly pushed to withhold Federal Emergency Management Agency money sent to New York City to house migrants, saying it had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d about the spending under a program appropriated by Congress.",
      "The Justice Department had previously asked the appeals court to let it implement sweeping pauses on federal grants and loans, calling the lower court order to keep promised money flowing \u201cintolerable judicial overreach.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Court Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island is presiding over a lawsuit from nearly two dozen Democratic states filed after the administration issued a boundary-pushing memo purporting to halt all federals grants and loans, worth trillions of dollars. The plan sparked chaos around the country.",
      "The administration has since rescinded that memo, but McConnell found Monday that not all federal grants and loans had been restored. He was the first judge to find that the administration had disobeyed a court order.",
      "Money for things like early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research has remained tied up even after his Jan. 31 order halting the spending freeze plan, the states said.",
      "McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, ordered the Trump administration to \u201cimmediately take every step necessary\u201d to unfreeze all federal grants and loans.",
      "He also said his order blocked the administration from cutting billions of dollars in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health, a move announced last week.",
      "The Justice Department said McConnell's order prevents the executive branch from exercising its lawful authority, including over discretionary spending or fraud.",
      "\u201cA single district court judge has attempted to wrest from the President the power to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u2019 This state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist for one more day,\u201d government attorneys wrote in their appeal.",
      "The states, meanwhile, argued that the president can\u2019t block money that Congress has approved, and the still-frozen grants and loans are causing serious problems for their residents. They urged the appeals court to keep allowing the case to play out in front of McConnell.",
      "Judges have also blocked, at least temporarily, Trump\u2019s push to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S., access to Treasury Department records by billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency and a mass deferred resignation plan for federal workers.",
      "The Republican administration previously said the sweeping funding pause would bring federal spending in line with the president\u2019s priorities, including increasing fossil fuel production, removing protections for transgender people and ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "A different federal judge in Washington has also issued a temporary restraining order against the funding freeze plan and since expressed concern that some nonprofit groups weren\u2019t getting their funding."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s most powerful adviser, Elon Musk, has made a rare public appearance at the White House to defend the swift and extensive cuts he\u2019s pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there may be mistakes",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's most powerful adviser, Elon Musk, made a rare public appearance at the White House on Tuesday to defend the swift and extensive cuts he's pushing across the federal government while acknowledging there have been mistakes and will be more.",
      "Musk stood next to the Resolute Desk with his young son as Trump praised Musk's work with his Department of Government Efficiency, saying they've found \u201cshocking\u201d evidence of wasteful spending. The Republican president signed an executive order to expand Musk's influence and continue downsizing the federal workforce.",
      "Despite concerns that he\u2019s amassing unaccountable power with little transparency, Musk described himself as an open book as he took questions from reporters for the first time since joining the Trump administration as a special government employee. He joked that the scrutiny over his sprawling influence over federal agencies was like a \u201cdaily proctology exam.\"",
      "He also claimed that DOGE's work was being shared on its website and on X, the social media platform owned by Musk. However, the DOGE website has no information, and the postings on X often lack many details, including which programs are being cut and where the organization has access.",
      "The White House has also been moving to limit independent oversight. The inspector general for the U.S. Agency for International Development was fired a day after warning that it had become nearly impossible to monitor $8.2 billion in humanitarian funds after DOGE began dismantling the agency.",
      "Musk defended DOGE's work as \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cnot draconian or radical.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people voted for major government reform, and that\u2019s what the people are going to get,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what democracy is all about.\u201d",
      "Musk acknowledged, in response to a question about false statements that the U.S. was spending $50 million on condoms for Gaza, that some of the claims he's made about government programs have been wrong.",
      "\u201cSome of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected. So nobody can bat 1,000,\u201d he said. He promised that he would act quickly to correct errors, and acknowledged that DOGE could be making errors as well.",
      "\u201cWe are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we\u2019ll also fix the mistakes very quickly,\u201d Musk said.",
      "He said there are some good people in the federal bureaucracy, but they need to be accountable. Musk described the workforce as an \u201cunelected\u201d fourth branch that had \u201cmore power than any elected representative.\u201d",
      "The executive order signed by Trump said a DOGE representative will need to approve almost all new hiring, a dramatic consolidation of personnel management across the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe agency shall not fill any vacancies for career appointments that the DOGE Team Lead assesses should not be filled, unless the Agency Head determines the positions should be filled,\u201d the order said.",
      "In addition, the Office of Management and Budget will require that agencies \u201chire no more than one employee for every four employees that depart.\" There would be exceptions when it comes to immigration, law enforcement and public safety.",
      "Agency leaders were also directed to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\" Government functions not required by statute would be prioritized for elimination.",
      "Trump and Musk are already pushing federal workers to resign in return for financial incentives, although their plan is currently on hold while a judge reviews its legality. The deferred resignation program, commonly described as a buyout, would allow employees to quit and still get paid until Sept. 30. Administration officials said more than 65,000 workers have taken the offer.",
      "Hundreds of people gathered for a rally Tuesday across the street from the U.S. Capitol in support of federal workers.",
      "Janet Connelly, a graphic designer with the Department of Energy, said she's fed up with emails from the Office of Personnel Management encouraging people to take the deferred resignation program.",
      "She tried to use her spam settings to filter out the emails but to no avail. Connelly said she has no plans to take the offer.",
      "\u201cFrom the get-go, I didn\u2019t trust it,\u201d she said.",
      "Connelly said she thinks of her work as trying to do an important service for the American public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too easy to vilify us,\" she said.",
      "Others have said fear and uncertainty have swept through the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re worried about their jobs. They\u2019re worried about their families. They\u2019re also worried about their work and the communities they serve,\u201d said Helen Bottcher, a former Environmental Protection Agency employee and current union leader in Seattle.",
      "Bottcher participated in a press conference hosted by Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington.",
      "Murray said workers \u201cdeserve better than to be threatened, intimidated and pushed out the door by Elon Musk and Donald Trump.\u201d She also said that \"we actually need these people to stay in their jobs or things are going to start breaking.\u201d",
      "A government lawyer, who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because of fears of retaliation, said it was a terrifying time to be a federal worker.",
      "She said people are worried that their phones and computers are being monitored. She's a single mother with a young daughter, and her father is urging her to take a safer job in the private sector.",
      "But she's skeptical of the deferred resignation program, emphasizing that accepting the offer means workers can't sue if they're not paid what they're promised.",
      "The idea, she said, was insane.",

      "Straws might seem insignificant, inspiring jokes about the plastic vs. paper debate, but the plastic straw has come to symbolize a global pollution crisis over the past decade.",
      "On Monday, President Donald Trump waded into the issue when he signed an executive order to reverse a federal push away from plastic straws, declaring that paper straws \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long. Trump said he thinks \u201cit\u2019s OK\u201d to continue using plastic straws, although they've have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life.",
      "In 2015, video of a marine biologist pulling a plastic straw out of a turtle\u2019s nose sparked outrage worldwide and countries and cities started banning them, starting with the Pacific Island nation Vanuatu and Seattle in 2018.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the larger fight over single-use plastics in the United States:",
      "More than 390 million plastic straws are used every day in the United States, most for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Turtle Island Restoration Network.",
      "Plastic straws are usually thrown away after one use, going on to litter beaches and waterways and potentially killing marine animals that mistake them for food.",
      "The straws are not recyclable because they are so small. They take at least 200 years to decompose, the network said.",
      "They break down into incredibly tiny bits of plastic smaller than a fraction of a grain of rice. These microplastics have been found in a wide range of body tissues. Though research is still limited overall, there are growing concerns that microplastics in the body could potentially be linked to heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, and other problems.",
      "Trump's executive order claims that paper straws use chemicals that may carry risks to human health are more expensive to produce than plastic straws. Researchers from the University of Antwerp found forever chemicals known as PFAS to be present in paper, bamboo, glass and plastic straws, but not stainless steel ones, according to a 2023 study.",
      "The advocacy group Beyond Plastics said that while plastics are often cheaper than paper products, the cheapest option is to skip the straw.",
      "Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator who now heads up Beyond Plastics, said she hopes that people react to the executive order by committing to using fewer plastic straws and that local and state governments do, too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to just kind of almost poke fun of this, ignore it,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cBut this is a moment that we as individuals and state and local policymakers can make a statement that they disagree with this executive order and are committed to using less plastic straws. It\u2019s not that hard to do.\u201d",
      "Several states and cities have banned plastic straws and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers.",
      "President Joe Biden administration\u2019s had committed to phasing out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "The move was a way for the federal government to formally acknowledge the severity of the plastic pollution crisis and the scale of the response required to effectively confront it.",
      "Erin Simon, an expert on plastics and packaging at the World Wildlife Fund, said at the time that it sent a message around the world: If we can make change happen at scale, so can you.",
      "The declaration came in July, just a few months before negotiators met in South Korea to try to finish crafting a treaty to address the global crisis of plastic pollution. Negotiators didn\u2019t reach an agreement late last year, but talks resume this year.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the United States at first adopted a position viewed as favoring industry, stating that countries should largely develop their own plans instead of abiding by global rules. China, the United States and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade.",
      "The United States changed its position heading into South Korea. The delegation said it would support having an article in the treaty that addresses supply, or plastic production. More than 100 countries want an ambitious treaty that limits plastic production while tackling cleanup and recycling.",
      "U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table but revert to the old position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, straws and shopping bags.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "In 2023, Ocean Conservancy volunteers collected more than 61,000 plastic straws and stirrers polluting beaches and waterways in the United States. There were even more cigarette butts, plastic bottles, bottle caps and food wrappers, the nonprofit said.",
      "Most plastic is made from fossil fuels. Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks known as COP28 agreed in 2023 the world must transition away from planet-warming fossil fuels and triple the use of renewable energy.",
      "As pressure to reduce fossil fuels has increased globally, oil and gas companies have been looking more to the plastics side of their business as a market that could grow. Trump strongly supports and gets support from the oil and gas industry.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered government agencies to restore public access to health-related webpages and datasets that they removed to comply with an executive order by President Donald Trump.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington agreed to issue a temporary restraining order requested by the Doctors for America advocacy group. The judge instructed the government to restore access to several webpages and datasets that the group identified as missing from websites and to identify others that also were taken down \u201cwithout adequate notice or reasoned explanation.\u201d",
      "On Jan. 20, his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an order for agencies to use the term \u201csex\u201d and not \"gender\" in federal policies and documents. In response, the Office of Personnel Management's acting director required agency heads to eliminate any programs and take down any websites that promote \u201cgender ideology.\u201d",

      "The nonprofit group cited the executive order's adverse impact on two of its members: a Chicago clinic doctor who would have consulted CDC resources to address a recent chlamydia outbreak in a high school and a Yale School of Medicine doctor who relies on CDC resources about contraceptives and sexually transmitted infections.",
      "\u201cThese doctors\u2019 time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The case is among dozens of lawsuits challenging executive orders that Trump, a Republican, issued within hours of his second inauguration.",
      "The scrubbed material includes reports on HIV prevention, a CDC webpage for providing clinicians with guidance on reproductive health care and an FDA study on \u201csex differences in the clinical evaluation of medical products.\u201d",
      "Removing important information from the CDC and FDA websites is delaying patient care, hampering research and hindering doctors' ability to communicate with patients, the plaintiffs' attorneys argued in a court filing.",
      "\u201cThe agencies\u2019 actions create a dangerous gap in the scientific data available to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, halt or hamper key health research, and deprive physicians of resources that impact clinical practice,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Government lawyers argued that Doctors for America's claims fall \u201cwell short of clearly showing irreparable harm\u201d to any plaintiffs and are unlikely to succeed on their merits.",
      "\u201cEither failure provides a sufficient basis for denying extraordinary relief,\u201d they wrote.",
      "During a hearing Monday, the judge asked plaintiffs' attorney Zachary Shelley if the removal of the online material harms the public. Shelley said the doctors' interests align with their patients.",
      "\u201cThere is immense harm to the public,\u201d Shelley said. \u201cThere are massive threats to public health.\u201d",
      "The judge concluded that the harm in this case ultimately trickles down to \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d seeking doctors' care.",
      "\u201cIf those doctors cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions,\u201d Bates wrote.",
      "Doctors for America is a not-for-profit group representing more than 27,000 physicians and medical trainees. It was born from an earlier organization that pushed for health reform and supported Barack Obama, a Democrat, when he was running for president."

      "BOSTON -- The state\u2019s top court ruled Tuesday that Karen Read can be retried on all the same charges in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, the latest twist in the long-running case that transfixed true crime fans nationwide.",
      "Prosecutors have sought to retry Read this year on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene of a crime. They accused her of ramming into John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm in January 2022. Read\u2019s attorneys argue she was framed to protect other law enforcement officers involved in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.",
      "A judge declared a mistrial in June after finding jurors couldn\u2019t reach an agreement, without polling the jurors to confirm their conclusions. Read\u2019s attorney Martin Weinberg argued that five jurors later said they were deadlocked only on the manslaughter count, and had unanimously agreed in the jury room that she wasn\u2019t guilty on the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. But they hadn\u2019t told the judge.",
      "The ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court clears the way for a new trial on all three charges.",
      "\u201cThe jury clearly stated during deliberations that they had not reached a unanimous verdict on any of the charges and could not do so. Only after being discharged did some individual jurors communicate a different supposed outcome, contradicting their prior notes,\u201d the judges wrote. \u201cSuch posttrial disclosures cannot retroactively alter the trial\u2019s outcome -- either to acquit or to convict.\u201d",
      "The judges also found \u201cno abuse of discretion\u201d in Judge Beverly Cannone's decision to declare a mistrial.",
      "\u201cAfter extensive, multiday deliberations, the jury submitted several increasingly emphatic notes about their inability to reach a unanimous verdict,\" they wrote, adding that the record before the judge \u201csuggested complete deadlock.\u201d",
      "Read's lawyer said they're considering their legal options.",
      "\u201cWhile we have great respect for the Commonwealth\u2019s highest court, Double Jeopardy is a federal constitutional right,\" Weinberg said in a statement. \"We are strongly considering whether to seek federal habeas relief from what we continue to contend are violations of Ms. Read\u2019s federally guaranteed constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "Weinberg had urged the court to allow an a evidentiary hearing where jurors could be asked whether they had reached final not guilty verdicts on any of the charges.",
      "Prosecutors maintained there\u2019s no basis for dismissing the charges of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. They argued that her lawyers should have sensed a mistrial was \u201cinevitable or unavoidable\u201d and that they had every opportunity to be heard in the trial courtroom.",
      "The judges questioned Weinberg over the the merits for holding an inquiry. Associate Justice Frank Gaziano noted that such inquiries are usually reserved for \u201cextraneous information\u201d such as \u201cracisms in the jury room.\" Chief Justice Kimberly Budd wondered about the limits of allowing an inquiry, which she suggested could open the door for other defendants to argue a juror came to them to say \u201cthat\u2019s not really what happened.\u201d",
      "Cannone ruled in August that Read could be retried on all three charges.",
      "\u201cWhere there was no verdict announced in open court here, retrial of the defendant does not violate the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d Cannone said.",
      "Prosecutors said Read, a former adjunct professor at Bentley College, and O\u2019Keefe, a 16-year member of the Boston police, had been drinking heavily before she dropped him off at a party at the home of Brian Albert, a fellow Boston officer. They said she hit him with her SUV before driving away. An autopsy found O\u2019Keefe had died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma.",
      "The defense portrayed Read as the victim, saying O\u2019Keefe was actually killed inside Albert\u2019s home and then dragged outside. They argued that investigators focused on Read because she was a \u201cconvenient outsider\u201d who saved them from having to consider law enforcement officers as suspects."

But what\u2019s been devastating is that that was everything we had of Tommy,\u201d she said, of their son who died at age 12 from a genetic disorder. \u201cIt\u2019s those memories and the little things, the photos, that you can\u2019t replace.\u201d",
      "As Schenker later understood it, \u201cWhen they lost their home, they lost virtually all proof that this child existed.\"",
      "\u201cIt is such a privilege to look into the intimate moments of people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve literally lost everything and they can\u2019t ever recreate those childhood photos.\u201d",
      "In photos Schenker found nearly 3 miles (5 km) from the Moss' family home, Tommy is seen as a 2-year-old, dressed like an angel for a Christmas pageant. In another, he is wearing a toddler-sized suit; in yet another, he\u2019s playing at daycare alongside his younger brother Dallas.",
      "\u201cIt is just breathtaking,\" Moss said. \u201cThis is one thing that the river didn\u2019t get to take \u2014 or didn\u2019t get to keep.\u201d",
      "More than 2,000 miles (3,200 km) away, in the Altadena foothills of Los Angeles, Claire Schwartz, 31, began to collect photos with a similar idea: Find images, post them online, try to unite them with their owners.",
      "After the Eaton fire, but before the first rain, she panicked. When rain and ash mix, it makes lye, which destroys photos. \u201cSomeone has to do this ASAP,\" she remembers thinking to herself. \"And I realized it had to be me \u2014 because nobody else was doing it.\u201d",
      "Luca Ackerman, a New York-based photo conservator, cautions that mold can start to develop 48 hours after water exposure. To slow the deterioration process, he freezes such prints \u2014 and advised to not wipe off any surfaces, which can drag toxic oils across the print, \u201cdriving particles deeper into the material.\u201d Some photos are so brittle, too, that when touched they may disintegrate.",
      "In the wake of disasters, conservators like Ackerman are deployed in volunteer rotations with the National Heritage Responders. Rapidly, he trains art handlers and museum staff how to treat sensitive materials, whether they are damaged by smoke, water, ash or soot.",
      "Wearing a respirator, nitrile gloves and booties, Schwartz swiftly set out to salvage photos \u2014 finding them alongside pages from yearbooks, sheet music, and children\u2019s art in nearby parks, neighbors\u2019 front yards and a golf course.",
      "\u201cThe wind has scattered everything, everywhere. And trash is mixed in with precious mementos, everywhere you look,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely bizarre how stuff clumps together and travels as a unit.\u201d",
      "Normally, a local library would take in found items, but the Altadena Public Library, along with more than 9,000 homes, burned to the ground. Librarians are redirecting residents who have found photos to Schwartz.",
      "She adopted parts of her process from what she learned as an archival intern at the Corita Art Center \u2014 protecting photos in acid-free, glassine envelopes and storing them in a waterproof box in a temperature-controlled room with good air circulation.",
      "Last week, she made her first match: disposable camera photos of teenagers, smiling, in prom dresses and glittering tiaras. The image is flecked with damage, but all four corners are intact.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2014 you formulate these ideas of who the person is\", Schwartz said. \u201cShe was kind of exactly what I pictured, just really friendly and bubbly and lovely \u2014 you could tell that just from her photos.\u201d",
      "Schwartz's house survived because her neighbors stayed behind to fight the fire themselves, but the landscape around it \u2014 full of burned-out lots, ghostly palm trees and blackened telephone poles \u2014 is otherworldly and changed. \u201cIt looks like the moon. It looks like another planet. It doesn\u2019t look like home.\u201d",
      "Nearby is Joshua Simpson, a photographer who lost his Altadena home and studio, along with decades of film negatives, silver gelatin prints and camera equipment. But something meaningful survived.",
      "\u201cThe very first thing we found was this beautiful vintage print of my mother-in-law holding my wife when she was a newborn baby.\u201d The black-and-white photo carries an extra layer of poignancy, as his mother-in-law died just few months ago. \u201cWe were both pretty overjoyed in that moment. It felt a little magical finding that one.\u201d",
      "Above all else, Ackerman said, personal safety comes first. \u201cWhen you\u2019re picking up people\u2019s heirlooms or family photographs, that can be traumatic \u2014 even if they\u2019re not yours,\u201d he said.",
      "When people survive catastrophic events such as wildfires or hurricanes, and then are left to cope with loss, they may express a wide range of emotions \u2014 from overwhelmed to outraged to numb, sometimes all at once. Tragedies, though, can also strengthen the ties in communities, and people like Schenker and Schwartz are Exhibits A and B.",
      "\u201cDisasters like this really bring out the best in people,\u201d Moss said. \u201cYou know, I can laugh or I can cry about it \u2014 and I choose to laugh about it. Fortunately, we didn\u2019t lose the most important thing. That\u2019s lives.\u201d",

      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans have filed a federal court lawsuit challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship",
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans \u2014 ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists \u2014 filed a federal court lawsuit Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups\u2019 religious freedom \u2014 namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally.",
      "\u201cWe have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,\u201d said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",
      "\u201cWe cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBy joining this lawsuit, we\u2019re seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus\u2019 command to love our neighbors as ourselves.\u201d",
      "The new lawsuit echoes and expands on some of the arguments made in a similar lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by five Quaker congregations and later joined by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple. It is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "There was no immediate Trump administration response to the new lawsuit, which names the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration enforcement agencies as defendants. However, a memorandum filed Friday by the Department of Justice, opposing the thrust of the Quaker lawsuit, outlined arguments that may also apply to the new lawsuit.",
      "In essence, the memo contended that the plaintiffs\u2019 request to block the new enforcement policy is based on speculation of hypothetical future harm \u2014 and thus is insufficient grounds for issuing an injunction.",
      "The memo said that immigration enforcement affecting houses of worship had been permitted for decades, and the new policy announced in January simply said that field agents \u2014 using \u201ccommon sense\u201d and \u201cdiscretion\u201d \u2014 could now conduct such operations without pre-approval from a supervisor.",
      "One part of that memo might not apply to the new lawsuit, as it argued the Quakers and their fellow plaintiffs have no basis for seeking a nationwide injunction against the revised enforcement policy.",
      "\u201cAny relief in this case should be tailored solely to the named plaintiffs,\u201d said the DOJ memo, contending that any injunction should not apply to other religious organizations.",
      "The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit represent a vastly larger swath of American worshippers \u2014 including more than 1 million followers of Reform Judaism, the estimated 1.5 million Episcopalians in 6,700 congregations nationwide, nearly 1.1 million members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the estimated 1.5 million active members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \u2014 the country\u2019s oldest predominantly Black denomination.",
      "Among the other plaintiffs are the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), with more than 3,000 congregations; the Church of the Brethren, with more than 780 congregations; the Convenci\u00f3n Bautista Hispana de Texas, encompassing about 1,100 Hispanic Baptist churches; the Friends General Conference, an association of regional Quaker organizations; the Mennonite Church USA, with about 50,000 members; the Unitarian Universalist Association, with more than 1,000 congregations; the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, with more than 500 U.S. congregations; and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ.",
      "\u201cThe massive scale of the suit will be hard for them to ignore,\u201d said Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection who is lead counsel for the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs joined the suit, she said, \u201cbecause their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\u201d",
      "Prior to the recent Trump administration change, Corkran said immigration agents generally needed a judicial warrant or other special authorization to conduct operations at houses of worship and other \u201csensitive locations\" such as schools and hospitals.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s go anywhere, any time,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cNow they have broad authority to swoop in \u2014 they\u2019ve made it very clear they\u2019ll get every undocumented person.\u201d",
      "She cited a recent incident in which a Honduran man was arrested outside his family\u2019s Atlanta-area church while a service was being held inside.",
      "The lawsuit includes details from some of the plaintiffs as to how their operations might be affected. The Union for Reform Judaism and the Mennonites, among others, said many of their synagogues and churches host on-site foodbanks, meal programs, homeless shelters and other support services for undocumented people who might now be fearful of participating.",
      "One of the plaintiffs is the Latino Christian National Network, which seeks to bring together Latino leaders with different traditions and values to collaborate on pressing social issues. The network\u2019s president is the Rev. Carlos Malav\u00e9, a pastor of two churches in Virginia, who described to the AP what network members are observing.",
      "\u201cThere is deep-seated fear and distrust of our government,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople fear going to the store, they are avoiding going to church. ... The churches are increasingly doing online services because people fear for the well-being of their families.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads the nation's largest denomination, did not join the lawsuit, though it has criticized Trump's migration crackdown. On Tuesday, Pope Francis issued a major rebuke of the deportation plan, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d",
      "Many conservative faith leaders and legal experts across the U.S. do not share concerns about the new arrest policy.",
      "\u201cPlaces of worship are for worship and are not sanctuaries for illegal activity or for harboring people engaged in illegal activity,\u201d said Mat Staver, founder of the conservative Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel.",
      "\u201cFugitives or criminals are not immune from the law merely because they enter a place of worship,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThis is not a matter of religious freedom. There is no right to openly violate the law and disobey law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Professor Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches in the theology department and law school at Boston College, questioned whether the plaintiffs would prevail with the religious freedom argument, but suggested the Trump administration might be unwise to disregard a traditional view of houses of worship as places of sanctuary for vulnerable people.",
      "\u201cThese buildings are different \u2014 almost like embassies,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of churches as belonging to an eternal country.\u201d",

      "A U.N. statement said the \u201cextraordinary\u201d decision to pause all operations and programs in Saada was due to the lack of necessary security conditions and guarantees. It called for the Houthis to release all detained U.N. staff.",
      "The rebels have detained dozens of U.N. staffers as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen\u2019s capital, accusing them of espionage \u2014 charges that rights groups call baseless.

      "ROME -- Pope Francis issued a major rebuke Tuesday to the Trump administration\u2019s plans for mass deportations of migrants, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \u201cwill end badly.\u201d",
      "Francis took the remarkable step of addressing the U.S. migrant crackdown in a letter to U.S. bishops in which he appeared to take direct aim at Vice President JD Vance's defense of the deportation program on theological grounds.",
      "U.S. border czar Tom Homan immediately pushed back, saying Francis should leave border enforcement to his office and noted the Vatican is a city-state surrounded by fortress-like walls.",
      "History's first Latin American pope has long made caring for migrants a priority of his pontificate, citing the biblical command to \u201cwelcome the stranger\u201d in demanding that countries welcome, protect, promote and integrate those fleeing conflicts, poverty and climate disasters. Francis has also said governments are expected to do so to the limits of their capacity.",
      "The Argentine Jesuit and President Donald Trump have long sparred over migration, including before Trump's first administration when Francis in 2016 famously said anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants rather than bridges was \u201cnot a Christian.\u201d",
      "In the letter, Francis said nations have the right to defend themselves and keep their communities safe from criminals.",
      "\u201cThat said, the act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Citing the Book of Exodus and Jesus Christ\u2019s own experience, Francis affirmed the right of people to seek shelter and safety in other lands and described the deportation plan as a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d unfolding in the U.S.",
      "Anyone schooled in Christianity \"cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhat is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,\u201d he wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that more than 8,000 people had been arrested in immigration enforcement actions since Trump took office Jan. 20. Some have been deported, others are being held in federal prisons and still others are being held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.",
      "Vance, a Catholic convert, has defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \u201cordo amoris.\u201d He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In his letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\u201cChristian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\u201d he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the \u2018Good Samaritan,\u2019 that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "David Gibson, director of the center for religion and culture at Fordham University, said in a social media post that Francis' letter \u201ctakes aim at every single absurd theological claim by JD Vance and his allies in conservative Catholicism (and the Catholic electorate).\"",
      "\u201cThis is the pope also directly countering misinformation about the Catholic faith that is being expounded by the Catholic vice president,\u201d he added to The Associated Press. \u201cAnd it is the pope supporting the bishops as well.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s reference to the ordo amoris had won support from many on the Catholic right in the U.S., including the Catholic League, which said he was right about the hierarchy of Christian love.",
      "Writing in Crisis Magazine, editor Eric Sammons said Vance was merely drawing on the wisdom of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas and the broader teaching of the Church to insist on loving things in an order.",
      "\u201cFor Augustine, every love, even the love of neighbor, must be ordered beneath the love of God,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis hierarchy extends to our human relationships where love for family, community, and nation should precede our love for the world at large, not in intensity but in priority of duty and responsibility.\u201d",
      "Homan, a Catholic, said Francis should fix the Catholic Church and leave U.S. border protection to his department.",
      "\u201cHe wants to attack us for securing our border. He's got a wall around the Vatican, does he not?\" Homan told reporters in a video from The Hill posted on X. \"So he's got a wall around that protects his people and himself, but we can't have a wall around the United States.\"",
      "The Vatican, a walled-in, 44-hectare (108-acre) city state inside Rome, recently increased sanctions for anyone who illegally enters the territory. The December law calls for a prison term of up to four years and a fine of up to 25,000 euros ($25,873) for anyone who enters with \u201cviolence, threat or deception,\" such as by evading security checkpoints.",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops had already put out an unusually critical statement after Trump\u2019s initial executive orders. It said those \"focused on the treatment of immigrants and refugees, foreign aid, expansion of the death penalty, and the environment, are deeply troubling and will have negative consequences, many of which will harm the most vulnerable among us.\u201d",
      "It was a strong rebuke from the U.S. Catholic hierarchy, which considers abortion to be the \u201cpreeminent priority\u201d for Catholic voters and had cheered the 2022 Supreme Court decision to end constitutional protections for abortion that was made possible by Trump-appointed justices. Trump won 54% of Catholic voters in the 2024 election, a wider margin than the 50% in the 2020 election won by President Joe Biden, a Catholic.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for a pope to address a country\u2019s bishops or faithful to deliver a specific message. But it\u2019s rare for a pope to weigh in on a specific political program of a country with such a letter, although migration is certainly an issue that the U.S. Catholic Church has long had at the forefront of its agenda.",

      "In the run up to Feb. 14, agricultural specialists at Miami International Airport have processed about 940 million stems of cut flowers, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Around 90% of the fresh cut flowers being sold for Valentine's Day in the United States come through Miami, while the other 10% pass through Los Angeles.",

      "\u201cWe transport flowers all year round, but specifically during the Valentine\u2019s season, we more than double our capacity because there\u2019s more than double the demand,\u201d Elias said.",
      "Flowers continue to make up one of the airport's largest imports, Miami-Dade chief operation officer Jimmy Morales said. The airport received more than 3 million tons of cargo last year, with flowers accounting for nearly 400,000 tons, worth more than $1.6 billion.",

      "\"Invasive species have caused $120 billion in annual economic and environmental losses to the United States, including the yield and quality losses for the American agriculture industry,\" Alonso said.",
      "Colombia's flower industry was recently looking at a possible 25% tariff, as President Donald Trump quarreled with the South American country's leadership over accepting flights carrying deported immigrants. But the trade dispute came to a halt in late January, after Colombia agreed to allow the flights to land.",

      "The heaviest snow, up to 10 inches (25.4 centimeters), was forecast in portions of northern and central Virginia and eastern West Virginia. Ice accumulations could range from a glaze in Kentucky and West Virginia to a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) in the Roanoke Valley of southwest Virginia, the weather service said. Power outages and tree damage were likely in places with heavy ice buildups.",

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it was taking steps to capture runoff and mitigate flood risk, including lowering some lake levels and emptying storage reservoirs.",
      "In northern Virginia, the National Park Service closed a portion of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, a narrow highway that winds its way through woods along the Potomac River. The parkway connects multiple small national park sites and has historically been a trouble spot during winter storms for abandoned cars that created a slalom course for snowplows and other vehicles.",

The city, which is more used to rain, only partially treats its street grid in the event of snow and ice and does not plow side streets. Such weather in the region can also prove deadly. Last year, snow, freezing rain, ice and frigid temperatures were blamed for at least 10 deaths in Oregon from hypothermia and falling trees or utility poles.",
      "The temperature was expected to bottom out Tuesday morning at minus 33 degrees (minus 36 degrees Celsius) in Butte, Montana, where over the past two winters at least five people died due to cold exposure, said Brayton Erickson, executive director of the Butte Rescue Mission.

      "Jurors in the trial of Hadi Matar, 27, on Monday heard from staffers at the arts institution where Rushdie was set to give a speech in August 2022, when authorities say the Fairview, New Jersey man attacked the author on stage and stabbed him more than a dozen times.",

    "story": [
      "US inflation increased by more than expected last month, as higher egg and energy prices helped to push up the cost of living for Americans.",
      "Inflation rose to 3% in January, its highest rate for six months, and above the 2.9% expected by economists.",
      "The rise comes weeks after the US central bank decided to hold interest rates, saying there was significant uncertainty about where the economy might be headed.",
      "It poses a challenge to US President Donald Trump, who made tackling inflation a centrepiece of his election campaign last year, but has put forward policies, such as higher tariffs on imports, that economists say risk pushing up prices.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest report could put pressure on Trump to reconsider those plans, which would raise taxes on goods entering the country.",
      "\"Tariffs can still be used as a bargaining tool to get some concessions from other countries, but the political optics of putting even a little upward pressure on consumer prices via tariffs wouldn't be great for the Trump administration,\" he wrote.",
      "The uptick in prices last month was wide-ranging, affecting car insurance, airfare, medicine and other basics.",
      "Grocery prices climbed 0.5% over the month, compared with 0.3% in December, as egg prices surged more than 15% amid shortages caused by outbreak of avian flu.",
      "That marked the biggest monthly increase in nearly a decade, the Labor Department said.",
      "Prices for clothing, by contrast, declined, while rents and other housing related costs increased 4.4% over the last year, marking the smallest 12-month increase since January 2022.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out food and energy and is seen by analysts as a better measure of underlying trends, was 0.4% over the month, the fastest pace since March.",
      "\"This is not a good number,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.",
      "\"It illustrates how the [Federal Reserve] has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022, hoping higher borrowing costs would cool the economy and ease pressures that were pushing up prices.",
      "It had started cutting rates in September, saying it wanted to avoid any further cooling.",

      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

      "Since then, the president has subsequently announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium entering the US, provoking furious responses from the likes of Canada and the European Union.",
      "Start building",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves recently announced her backing for a third runway at Heathrow as well as expanding Luton and Gatwick airports, and building a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge.",
      "However, these projects are not expected to be completed for a number of years.",

      "But it said: \"Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model's legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin.\"",

      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",

      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",

      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",

      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",

    "story": [
      "Heathrow Airport has confirmed a multi-billion pound investment plan to expand two of its terminals ahead of submitting proposals for a third runway to the government this summer.",
      "Heathrow Airport chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he wants planes to take off from its new third runway before the end of the next parliament, which could be ten years or fewer.",
      "The plans, which will be paid for with private cash, come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves backed a third runway at the UK's largest airport last month as part of efforts to grow the UK economy.",
      "Reeves' decision to back Heathrow's expansion has angered campaigners and members of her party who oppose it on environmental grounds.",
      "During his speech at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, Mr Woldbye signed a pact to use UK steel to build new infrastructure.",
      "He also revealed funding to increase capacity at terminals two and five, and plans to reconfigure the airfield and improve bus connections.",
      "The commitment to use UK-made steel comes amid concern in the industry over the impact of tariffs being placed on imports of the metal to the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "The US import taxes could lead to excess steel being offloaded to the UK at cheaper prices, with the potential to undercut domestic businesses.",
      "While the detailed plans for a third runway at the UK's largest airport, are yet to be finalised, the construction of terminal five, which opened in 2008, required some 80,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "The expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial and faces opposition from environmental groups, many politicians, as well as nearby local authorities and residents.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "\"A third runway at Heathrow can not be a choice between economic growth and the environment,\" Mr Woldbye said.",
      "He added that it was a \"collective mission\" to grow Heathrow \"responsibly within environmental boundaries.\"",
      "The aviation industry is a source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and it's already under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr Woldbye outlined the expansion plan ahead of the new runway, which will see upgrades to terminal buildings to \"enhance passenger experience and improve resilience and sustainability\".",
      "\"This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year,\" he said.",
      "The chancellor has said expansion at Heathrow is \"badly needed\" and could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "Zengwei An, chief executive of British Steel - which has the only facility in the country to make primary steel - said its workers in Scunthorpe and Teeside had a \"distinguished history of supplying world-class products into projects like Heathrow's expansion\".",
      "Gareth Stace, director-general of the steel industry body UK Steel, added that Heathrow committing to using domestically-made steel was a \"major vote of confidence in UK steelmaking and British businesses full stop\".",
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built in 10 years, Reeves says",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building it could take about seven years.",
      "Reeves has said she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" before 2029 and planes to start using the runway by 2035, but Mr Woldbye has previously warned the project would take years and need \"Churchillian resolve\" to deliver.",
      "In his speech, the Heathrow boss said the airport's expansion plans will be carried out with \"strict environmental safeguards\"",
      "\"This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon... it's as simple as that,\" he added.",
      "\"I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.\"",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and provides a key avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is strained: last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit. A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "summary": "Beverage giant's boss says his company may need to action if aluminium cans become more expensive.",
    "story": [
      "Coca-Cola may have to sell more drinks in plastic bottles in the US if President Donald Trump's tariffs end up making aluminium cans more expensive, the company's chief executive, James Quincey, said in a call with investors.",
      "It comes after Trump ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US, which could end up driving up the price of canned food and drink items in the country.",
      "In December, the beverage giant scaled down its sustainability target of using 50% recycled materials in its packaging by 2030, to using 35% to 40% by 2035.",
      "Environmental groups have labelled Coca-Cola as the \"top global plastic polluter\" for six consecutive years.",
      "\"If one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said.",
      "\"For example, if aluminium cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles\".",
      "The Coca-Cola boss also sought to minimise the impact of the tariffs on his business saying packaging is only a relatively small component of his company's costs.",
      "In recent years, Coca-Cola had been selling more products in aluminium containers as part of its marketing and sustainability strategies.",
      "Despite being generally more expensive, aluminium cans are also a lot more recyclable than plastic bottles over time.",
      "The US imports almost half of the aluminium it uses, according to the United States Geological Survey, so a 25% tariff on all imports is likely to cause cans to become even more costly.",

    "summary": "The move threatens to have a big impact in Canada, a major source of the metals in the US.",
    "story": [
      "Leaders in Europe and Canada have said they will not let Donald Trump's plans to hit their steel and aluminium exports with tariffs go unchallenged.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the move would trigger \"firm and proportionate countermeasures\" while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also pledged to \"stand up for\" Canadian workers and businesses.",
      "The comments came after the US president ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US, ending previous exemptions for allies including Canada and the EU and marking a major expansion of trade barriers.",
      "Trump said he was \"simplifying\" the rules and the measures would boost domestic production.",
      "\"This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,\" Trump said, signing the proclamation, which said the measures would come into force on 12 March.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminium to be made in America, not in foreign lands,\" he added.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers.",
      "Canada alone accounted for more than 50% of aluminium imported into the US last year.",
      "The tariffs will raise the cost of bringing the metals into the US, sparking concern among businesses in the US that rely on the imports and many world leaders because it will make it more expensive for companies to sell their products in the world's largest economy.",
      "If the tariffs come into force as outlined, they are expected to have the most significant impact on Canada.",
      "Trudeau called the threatened tariffs \"unacceptable\" and he hoped talks with the Trump administration would resolve the issue without the need for dollar-for-dollar retaliation.",
      "\"If it comes to that, our response will be firm and clear,\" he said. \"We will stand up for Canadian workers, we will stand up for Canadian industries.\"",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".",
      "\"They will trigger firm and proportionate countermeasures. The EU will act to safeguard its economic interests,\" she said. \"Tariffs are taxes - bad for business, worse for consumers.\"",
      "But leaders also offered measured responses.",
      "At a press conference, Mexico's economy minister called the tariffs unjustified but did not outline retaliation plans, while South Korea's acting president said his country's strategy would be to build \"close relationship with the Trump administration\".",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Five ways China is hitting back against US tariffs",
      "China's tit-for-tat tariffs on US take effect",
      "'Replay of 2018'",
      "Share prices of the major US steelmakers rose on Monday in anticipation of the order, with the price of Cleveland-Cliffs jumping nearly 20%. Prices for steel and aluminium also jumped, while the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell.",
      "But the response in much of the rest of the market was muted, reflecting questions about how serious Trump is about his plans, given his track record of postponing tariffs, or negotiating exemptions to the rules.",
      "\"The market I think is beginning to wonder, to what degree is this a negotiation tactic by Trump or to what degree is he really willing to push these tariffs through?\" said Jane Foley from Rabobank.",
      "In 2018, during Trump's first term, he announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 15% on aluminium, but he eventually negotiated carve-outs for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"This is sort of a replay of 2018,\" said Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "\"The biggest question is the uncertainty over whether this is a bargaining tactic or whether he just doesn't want to talk with other countries and really wants to help out the steel industry in that way.\"",
      "Last week, Trump ordered import duties of 25% on all Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay that plan for 30 days. He also brought in new US levies of 10% on all Chinese goods coming into the US, prompting retaliation from China.",
      "A tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter a country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "The taxes are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "But there are also concerns about the effect in the US, where many manufacturers use steel and aluminium in their products and now face added costs.",
      "Industry groups from construction to can-makers warned about the hit.",
      "When asked if tariffs could increase prices for consumers, the US president responded: \"Ultimately it will be cheaper.\"",
      "\"It's time for our great industries to come back to America... this is the first of many,\" he added, suggesting other tariffs could focus on pharmaceuticals and computer chips.",
      "In Trump's first term, the tariffs, despite many exemptions, raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.",
      "Stephen Moore, who advised Trump's campaign on economic issues in 2016 and is currently a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, said he did not think tariffs on steel and aluminium were effective way to create jobs, noting the experience of the first term.",
      "He said while Trump was \"deadly serious\" about trade, he thought the plan was \"about getting the rest of the world's attention\".",
      "\"Just about everything Donald Trump does in Washington is a negotiating tactic,\" he said.",
      "Trump officials said the latest moves were aimed at stopping countries such as China and Russia from avoiding tariffs by routing low-cost products through other countries.",
      "The US president said he was introducing new standards that require steel to be \"melted and poured\" and aluminium to be \"smelted and cast\" in North America.",
      "Nick Iacovella, a spokesman for Coalition for a Prosperous America, which represents steel-makers and supports the tariffs, said his group is most concerned about a surge of steel imports from Mexico, above levels agreed in 2019.",
      "But he noted that Canada sends far more goods to the US than it imports - a trade deficit that has been a key issue for Trump.",
      "\"There are still imbalances with the Canadian and United States trading relationship that should be addressed,\" he said.",
      "He added: \"I don't think they're planning to take a one-size-fits-all hammer approach to this, but I think early on, in the beginning at least right now, I do think what the president is saying ... [is] both of those countries [Canada and Mexico] are abusing their relationship with the US and we're going to do something about it.\""

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:49:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has agreed a new subsidy arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station in north Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "story": [
      "UK retailers are being \"raided like a piggy bank\", the boss of Marks & Spencer has said, as the sector faces rising taxes.",
      "Writing in the Sunday Times, Stuart Machin said retailers were facing a series of headwinds, including the increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) paid by firms and higher packaging levies.",
      "He called for a number of changes from the government, including staggering the NIC changes over time.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said measures introduced in last year's Budget aimed to deliver stability to businesses and create the conditions for growth.",
      "Mr Machin said that many of the announcements made by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in a speech last month were \"commendable\", such as the focus on long-term planning and attempts to boost investment in infrastructure.",
      "But he added that if the government wanted to boost growth quickly, then \"lightening the burden that the Budget loaded onto the retail sector\" should be a priority.",
      "In October's Budget, the government increased the rate of National Insurance (NI) paid by employers from April, and also reduced the threshold that employers start paying it at from \u00a39,100 to \u00a35,000. April will also see an increase in the National Living Wage.",
      "The government has defended its tax rises as necessary to avoid cuts to public services, and the rise in the minimum wage, with a bigger boost for younger workers and apprentices, has been welcomed by trade unions.",
      "The Treasury has also said that due to exemptions for smaller businesses, more than half of employers will either see a cut or no change in their National Insurance bills.",
      "But the changes have provoked criticism from businesses, and in November last year M&S was one of the signatories to a letter sent by major retailers to the chancellor asking her to reconsider some of the measures.",
      "Next boss warns first jobs could become harder to find",
      "Warning retail job cuts \u2018inevitable\u2019 after Budget",

      "As well as changes to employment rights and the increase in employers' NICs, Mr Machin also criticised a new packaging levy.",
      "The extended producer responsibility (EPR) measure is designed to make producers pay the full net costs of managing and recycling packaging waste, and so aims to reduce unsustainable packaging.",
      "In its letter to the chancellor in November, the British Retail Consortium estimated the measure would cost the sector \u00a32bn.",
      "Mr Machin said EPR would \"give retailers a tax bill 20 times the current amount with \u00a32bn going straight to the Treasury as general taxation and no improvement to recycling\".",
      "\"Retail is being raided like a piggy bank and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "He called for the government to phase in the timing of the NICs increase over two years - echoing a call by Next boss Lord Wolfson - to give retailers \"breathing space\".",

    "story": [
      "A UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.",
      "Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.",
      "The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.",
      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",

      "\"I think this is an odd decision, and a kick in the teeth for UK manufacturing,\" Metcalfe told the BBC.",
      "\"We brought our manufacturing here with assurances that this [tariffs on Chinese bikes] was a long term change. We've invested a lot in it. We're a small business, family-owned, and trying to do the right thing by building a quality product,\" he said.",
      "The UK was already a very competitively priced market for bikes, with little need to bring in cheaper bikes from China, he added.",
      "\"What's the benefit? I don't see any. The government are saying there'll be savings for the UK consumer, but for years we've been pushing government to put through alternative savings like grants and subsidies for customers.\"",

      "A government spokesperson said: \"Defending UK industry from unfair competition is important, which is why we've taken the decision to continue protecting UK folding e-bike producers based in the UK, whilst also lowering prices for consumers and importers of other products.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was \"continuing to take action on unsafe e-bikes\" and had recently launched a campaign \"to raise awareness of the risks of dangerous e-bike batteries and scooters\".",
      "'A scary time for the industry'",
      "The UK bike industry has endured a tough few years following a boom during the Covid pandemic, which saw an increase in outdoor exercise and many people choosing cycling over public transport.",

      "\"It's a very scary time for the industry right now, and this will cause a lot of trouble for a lot of companies,\" he said.",
      "David's company designs its bikes in the UK, but manufactures them in Taiwan and Portugal.",
      "He said he had already been contacted by Chinese bike manufacturers offering very low prices for their products.",
      "\"They've overstocked too, and they now see the UK as a place to dump their bikes,\" he said, adding that he may now consider focusing solely on fold up e-bikes.",
      "\"I think the government are thinking 'Let's give e-bikes a boost' but this has been badly thought-through by people who don't understand the industry,\" he said.",
      "The Bicycle Association, which represents firms who make and sell standard and fold up bikes, said it was helping its members to respond to the new rules.",
      "\"This is a significant decision and it may take some time for the implications for the UK cycle industry and its supply chains to become clear,\" a spokesman said.",

We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "summary": "Students explain their hopes for the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship.",
    "story": [
      "David Boutflour's background is as far from the glamour of space launches as it's possible to imagine.",
      "The 31-year-old worked in hospitality for nine years, becoming the general manager for a gastro-pub in Cheshire. But it wasn't the real career for him. \"I felt I could do more,\" he says.",
      "Mr Boutflour had been interested in space and aviation from a young age, mentioning Concorde as an early inspiration.",
      "A course at Portsmouth University caught his imagination - the UK's first Space Systems Degree Apprenticeship launched in conjunction with BAE Systems.",
      "To build up funds to help pay for the course, he switched to lorry driving - a move which did not prepare his social circle for his change of direction.",
      "\"Everybody thought I was lying when I said I'd been accepted on this course. They thought I was pulling their leg, going from truck driver to space engineer!\"",
      "The four-and-a-half year course involves on-the-job learning at sites where BAE Systems designs and assembles satellites.",
      "Back at Portsmouth they'll be studying space systems engineering.",
      "The academic side of the course consists of four modules, in thermodynamics, programming, digital systems and maths, all split between lectures and laboratory time.",
      "Mr Boutflour is joined by four others on the paid apprenticeship.",
      "One of those is Alice Overend.",
      "Aged 21, she had already worked on satellite assembly and testing when she applied for the Portsmouth course.",
      "This work involved the ill-fated Prometheus 2 satellites that were lost during a failed attempt to launch a satellite into space by Virgin Orbit in 2023.",
      "This incident made a deep impression on her. \"It was quite surreal, we were all watching the launch in the office and when the coverage ended we just went home.\"",
      "Unsuccessful satellite launches are part of life in the space business. But the Virgin Orbit loss stuck in the mind of other Portsmouth students. It stands for the risk element in space work.",
      "Ms Overend's background in satellite testing has given her a head-start in terms of understanding how a sprawling UK space industry fits together. \"The whole space sector is going in a good direction.\"",
      "She explains the true meaning of \"space systems\" in her world.",
      "\"Systems is about making sure everything is where it should be, such as the satellite weight being precisely right.\"",
      "George Smith is the youngest of the group at 18, and joined the course straight from A levels in physics, maths and engineering.",
      "In his home town of York he and some friends took apart an old lawn mower to build a go-kart out of the parts.",
      "How did the go-kart perform? \"It only wanted to turn to the right, but we learnt a lot about why it wasn't working.\"",
      "Not everything in space exploration goes to plan either, but practical work like this is an integral part of the course.",
      "\"The apprenticeship appealed to me. I find studying and applying the lesson in practice means I learn better. So I was looking at degree apprenticeships and this course was a checklist of everything I wanted to do.\"",
      "Space is an expanding sector and he harbours a desire to get beyond earth's atmosphere one day \"if I can tick all the right boxes to become an astronaut\".",
      "Right now the course is meeting his expectations. \"To say it's a dream come true is cheesy, but I've got in the door.\"",
      "Elizabeth Seward is the head of space strategy at BAE Systems.",
      "Despite her own background as a physicist, Ms Seward thinks people are put off this sector by a perception that it's exclusively for rocket scientists.",
      "\"Space tends to get put on a pedestal. But the truth is we need more people from other backgrounds. A career here is for anyone interested in space, such as project managers or lawyers.\"",
      "The appeal of space is evident at Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, where Dr Stephanie Docherty teaches orbital mechanics, how a satellite gets on the right path, as part of the aerospace course.",
      "She agrees that specialisation is less important than aptitude in the space sector. \"Employers want a problem solving mind-set. And I have noticed a real appetite from students for more space content in their course.\"",
      "Proposals to build rocket-launching sites in remote locations such as the Shetland Islands mean more positions should open up in the UK space industry in the very near future.",
      "After the grounding of the Space Shuttle in 2011 Mr Boutfleur felt space exploration \"took a step backwards.\"",
      "Now he says the success of Elon Musk's SpaceX reusable launchers is enormously significant.",
      "\"Musk has very much re-ignited the space race\".",
      "All three students agree that the hands-on side of the course is inspiring.",
      "And outside of the space syllabus what do they get up to?",
      "\"Most of us play video games,\" says Mr Smith, with Ms Overend nodding in agreement.",

    "story": [
      "As I write, there are a lot of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to Paris \u2013 and a sense that many of them are holding their breath.",
      "On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence.",
      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",
      "Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. \"DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,\" says the computer scientist.",
      "\"We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\"",
      "On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better.",
      "Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".",
      "Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit \u2013 having not come to previous gatherings.",
      "The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.",
      "Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not.",
      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",
      "In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.",
      "In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.",
      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",
      "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "DeepSeek vs ChatGPT - how do they compare?",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.",
      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",

      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",
      "We can exclusively reveal 42 of the 88 schools involved are now withholding payments to the contract. The investigation also found:",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in JanuarySchools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract endsNone of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",

      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",

      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

      "It is also nearly impossible to tell if a university will go bust.",
      "That is because universities borrow money from banks based on the value of the assets they own, like buildings and land.

      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",

      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",

      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",

      "It was shortly after Sir Salman was introduced that he said he noticed a person rushing at him from his right-hand side.",

    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",

    "story": [
      "BBC journalist Nick Robinson says his X account was hacked and used to promote cryptocurrency after he was apparently targeted in an online phishing scam.",
      "The Today programme presenter became locked out of his account on X, previously known as Twitter, on Monday night after he clicked a link in an email he wrongly believed was sent to him by the social media platform.",
      "Robinson, 61, said that he was still locked out of his account on Tuesday after his passwords were changed, \"so anything you read today, it won't be me\".",
      "A cyber security expert said such attacks were likely to be opportunistic, with code instead of humans seeking out social media users who have a large number of followers, to exploit them.",
      "The email sent to Robinson was designed to look like it was legitimate, and included a link it said would allow him to review content it claimed had violated X's policies to stop his account being suspended.",
      "But the email address which sent the email did not end with \"@x.com\" or \"@e.X.com\" addresses used by the platform for official communication.",
      "Following Tuesday's Today programme, Robinson said he had fallen for the scam despite having completed online security courses which highlighted tell-tale signs of phishing emails.",
      "He said: \"Why? Because my defences were down - I was tired after a very long day, I was rushing, and the phishing email made me think that if I didn't act fast I'd be in trouble.",
      "\"However, I didn't just fall for it. I tried repeatedly to use the official authentic X site to deal with the problem I was being alerted to, and only after trying again and again and failing did I think 'oh sod it, what's the worst that can happen?'",
      "\"Well now I know. I should have thought the opposite - i.e. if this alleged problem is really serious they'll be in touch again.\"",
      "He added: \"My main mistake was not to check the email address which made clear it wasn't X that were contacting me but a hacker. Everything else looked just like the real thing.\"",
      "Robinson told Today listeners the hack came days after he was \"swamped by critical messages\" from supporters of Elon Musk after he had pointed out a statement made by the billionaire owner of X was untrue.",
      "His Today co-host Amol Rajan had raised the hack, joking that his \"very own tech bro, the mighty Nick Robinson, has finally succumbed to the temptations online, and I see overnight, is launching a cryptocurrency\".",
      "\"This is the big news in Britain, and what listeners want to know, Nick, is how do they invest?,\" he added.",
      "Robinson said his account had been used to make it look like he was launching a cryptocurrency called '$Today' on the Solana blockchain platform.",
      "\"So if you read that, it's complete nonsense, quite entertaining nonsense,\" Robinson told the programme.",
      "He added: \"But there's a lesson learned - don't click on everything you see.\"",
      "Taking over X accounts to advertise scam crypto coins is a common method used by low-skilled cyber criminals to make a quick buck.",
      "They often spread the net wide by sending out phishing emails to many high profile accounts in order to maximise their chances of getting a bite. At that point they take over the account and plan their posts around hastily spun up crypto coins that can only take a couple of hours to create and launch.",
      "They hope that high profile and trusted accounts might encourage people to buy some of the otherwise worthless coins so that they can make some money before it all get blocked and stopped. In this case it looks like the scammers failed to make much money at all for their efforts.",
      "But Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at cyber-security firm Darktrace, said anyone can be targeted and fall victim to similar hacking scams.",
      "\"There are signs we can look out for. But the problem with these emails is they are designed to attack us when we are distracted and busy,\" he said.",
      "\"Good advice is don't don't click links in emails. If it's an important message, it will be there on the relevant website for me when I log on to it.",

      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",

      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",

      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",

    "summary": "What was it like to act in a video game thought to have one of the longest scripts ever written for the medium?",
    "story": [
      "You'll often hear about actors and the role of a lifetime, but for Tom McKay and Luke Dale it's especially relevant.",
      "For the past nine years they've dedicated most of their working lives to two video games - Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KCD) and its sequel.",
      "Added together, the scripts for the role-playing epics set in 15th Century Bohemia run to more than three million words, according to their makers.",
      "It's thought that KCD 2, which came out last week, could be the longest single video game script ever written.",
      "Both actors spoke to BBC Newsbeat about what it was like to be part of such a huge project and working with the game's controversial director.",
      "The original KCD was something of a slow-burn sleeper hit. Its review scores were respectable when it released in 2018 but it wasn't universally acclaimed.",
      "However, it found a passionate fanbase in the months and years afterwards and the appetite for a sequel grew.",
      "KCD 2 arrived to positive reviews and sold one million copies within 24 hours of launching.",
      "The sequel follows the story of Tom's character Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son turned knight, and Luke's character, the impulsive Sir Hans Capon.",
      "It's a sprawling, open-ended game that allows players to carve their own path through it.",
      "This means it's possible to find important characters or items outside of the storylines that revolve around them, and the game will respond to these variable possibilities.",
      "That's something the game's developers have to account for, and something that Tom in particular, as the main playable character, needs to act out over and over again with subtle differences each time.",
      "It meant hundreds of hours of studio time and repeat trips to Prague, where developer Warhorse Studios is based.",
      "He says it was \"one of the most amazing and unusual acting challenges\" he's faced.",
      "\"You would kind of go down one channel of a decision and then come halfway back up and go down another one and then maybe all the way back up to the beginning and back down,\" he says.",
      "\"And that's not an acting challenge that you ever would have in TV or film.\"",
      "The video games industry is secretive, and both Tom and Luke spent three years under a non-disclosure agreement as they made the second game.",
      "\"It was almost like working for GCHQ or something,\" says Tom, referring to the British intelligence agency.",
      "\"You couldn't talk to anyone about it and people in the studio couldn't even talk to their partners in some cases about what they were doing.\"",
      "Tom says he would occasionally bump into fans of the game when he was working on other projects, and would have to dodge the question when they grilled him about a sequel.",
      "He says it was more difficult when he bumped into fans of the game in the Czech Republic, where the game is celebrated as a national success story.",
      "When they asked why he was spending so much time in Prague, Tom admits he had to bend the truth a little.",
      "\"I'd be like: 'I just love Prague. And I come here very often for lots of holidays,\" he says.",
      "Luke says many fans \"gave up hope\" that a sequel was on the way, given the six-year gap between the two titles.",
      "But when the new game was revealed, he says, there was \"this incredible reception and everyone went absolutely crazy\".",
      "It also reignited an online discourse that had erupted around the release of the original KCD.",
      "Daniel V\u00e1vra, the co-founder and creative director of Warhorse, is a regular poster on social media and is quick to answer critics.",
      "He defended the first KCD, when it was criticised for its lack of diversity, as being historically accurate to the time and location of its setting, although there is not universal agreement about this.",
      "At the time he also made public statements against perceived attempts to force diversity into games, saying his upbringing in communist Czechoslovakia had made him an opponent of \"censorship in the name of good intentions\".",
      "This won him supporters among the so-called Gamergate movement, which emerged online in 2014 and is widely seen as a backlash against attempts to make gaming more inclusive.",
      "Members celebrated V\u00e1vra for his outspoken, uncompromising approach.",
      "But as the release of KCD 2 approached some of those voices turned against him as it emerged that the sequel features a black character and a gay love scene that can play out if players make certain decisions.",
      "\"I think it's quite a quite an interesting thing that's happened,\" says Luke.",
      "\"With the first game there was a backlash from a more left-wing mentality and then there's been something of a backlash this time around from the right-wing mentality.\"",
      "Both Luke and Tom, having spent the days after KCD 2's release meeting fans, say they believe the complaints are from an unrepresentative minority.",
      "\"It's a really good barometer of the distortion between online interaction and real world interaction,\" says Tom.",
      "\"We did nine hours and it didn't come up once.\"",
      "Luke adds: \"I think to be honest with you, the people that are true big fans of gaming and this game aren't bothered about that sort of stuff.",
      "\"It seems to be people that are really politically involved and they care very much about politics and not gaming and they've just used this as a weapon, but they're not necessarily into gaming.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 03:47:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Grab your diary and your ice cream - here are Bridget's relatable wisdoms for those trying to survive adulthood.",
    "story": [
      "Your 20s are a whirlwind of bad dates, career crises, and wondering if you'll ever really get your life together.",
      "Enter Bridget Jones, the queen of chaotic charm, who has been stumbling through life lessons since before many of us can remember.",
      "Despite the original Bridget Jones's Diary book being released in 1996 and the film in 2001, it seems the floundering and flawed heroine has captivated the hearts of Gen Z, who weren't born when Helen Fielding's novel was first published.",
      "Fielding says she finds it \"comforting\" that women in their 20s have a real interest in Bridget\u2019s trials and tribulations. At her book signings, she says \"half the audience are Gen Zs\".",
      "From navigating embarrassing work mishaps to realising that self love (and maybe an extra glass of Chardonnay) is the key to happiness, Bridget has been there, done that, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "Ahead of the release of the new film Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy next week, we've been speaking to three women in their 20s about the life lessons the character taught them: Sophie Gwillym from Cardiff, 28, Hannah Booth in Chester, 25, and 27-year-old Sophie Tyler from Yorkshire.",
      "And then there's us - Yasmin and Noor - both fans of the franchise who have a lot to say about it.",
      "When did you discover Bridget Jones?",
      "Yasmin: In the summer before high school, I stole a tattered copy of Bridget Jones's Diary from my parents' bookshelf and read it all in one night hidden under my duvet. To me, it was a bible for adult life, which, being on the edge of puberty and going into year seven, felt like a total must-read. Almost all of it went over my head at that age but one thing stuck with me: Bridget Jones felt like a real woman who, unlike other perfect heroines that featured in many stories that were actually aimed at children, was flawed and nuanced.",
      "Noor: I was at school and I remember my English teacher talking about one of the films. She was refusing to go see it, as she felt the whole premise was completely unrealistic (\"As if such a beautiful, competent woman would be struggling to find love\"). But my older sister was going, so I tagged along and it was love at first sight plus I'll admit I fancied Hugh Grant just a bit.",
      "Sophie T: My best friend and I watched the first film at a sleepover when we were about 14. I think, on reflection, the scene where Bridget sleeps with Hugh Grant\u2019s character, Daniel Cleaver, for the first time probably wasn't appropriate for us...  I do remember thinking she shouldn't have worn the big knickers (but I would've had no idea why), and we giggled through all the adult bits.",
      "What can a 1990s icon teach someone in their 20s about love today?",
      "Noor: Bridget Jones's obsession with Daniel Cleaver was my life in my 20s. I was chasing after bad boys and addicted to the drama, so it was completely relatable. My friends and I were in endless casual relationships \u2013 and that's very Bridget too. Her dating life was the definition of the situationship, before that was even a thing. But what I really like is how she (eventually) realises she deserves better. She teaches us you can find a Mr Darcy who loves you \"just as you are\" \u2013 even if he does wear reindeer jumpers and fold his pants before bed.",
      "Yasmin: Bridget has given us the ultimate guide to getting over a heartbreak: lying on the sofa wearing old pyjamas and eating ice cream out of the tub while you sob to All By Myself. Unlike the Bridget of the early films, today's 20-somethings aren't incessantly checking for answerphone messages but we are guilty of a bit of post-breakup stalking. Even if the tech isn't the same, early Bridget's neurotic tendencies can still teach us that obsessing over someone is rarely worth it.",
      "Sophie G: Bridget isn't a perfect character, and that's OK. You should be loved for who you are and not try to change yourself to fit in with what society thinks you should be - but learning to accept that is a hard task.",
      "Hannah: At first, Bridget is the epitome of a woman who thinks she needs a man to survive but by the end of the first film, she teaches us to value nice, respectful guys and not to tolerate people who cheat (though, admittedly, they shouldn't have made Daniel Cleaver so hot!).",
      "She also teaches us how to work at a relationship, that love is a choice as well as a feeling, and how to be vulnerable and have boundaries at the same time.",
      "What does Bridget's character mean to you?",
      "Sophie T: It comes back to not needing to change yourself in a society that pressurises us constantly to be skinnier, taller, to read more books and be the best at hobbies. Having a character with self-acceptance is so important when we are constantly being pressured to change ourselves.",
      "Yasmin: I love that Bridget embraces her chaotic energy and that really appeals to Gen Z. If she was a woman in her 20s now, she'd definitely have fallen madly in love with the concept of brat summer - instead of Chaka Khan, she'd be blaring out Charli XCX's 365 through her headphones on her morning commute.",
      "Noor: Wear the big knickers. Eating the entire contents of your fridge is OK sometimes. And don't be defeated by a bad hair day!",
      "But, isn't the series a bit problematic for 2025?",
      "Yasmin: Bridget is by no means perfect - her calorie counting obsession feels dated and other characters branding a woman who weighs 60kg fat is jarring. Body positivity may be more celebrated now - in fact, some women would love \"a bottom the size of two bowling balls\" - but being self-conscious about your appearance is a universal feeling that transcends decades.",
      "One thing I will say is that it's hard to feel too sorry for Bridget when she owns her own flat in central London, has a successful publishing and journalism career and doesn't seem to worry about the price of a round of drinks at the pub - it all feels a little less realistic now.",
      "Noor: You could definitely argue the earlier books and films haven't aged well. First of all, there's a noticeable lack of diversity, and way too many sexist jokes. Then you chuck in all that obsessing over being single, and Bridget's fretting over her calorie intake.",
      "Much of that feels out of place in the context of the progress we've made now, but that's not to say it no longer has relevance: one of my friends is considering Ozempic and others still worry about why they've not met their dream partner as they swipe through Tinder and Bumble.",
      "Sophie G: I think if Bridget was created now, some of those more \"problematic\" elements of her character might be changed but that would be a shame, as it's part of her charm.",
      "We all say and do things we kick ourselves for later. And most of Bridget's more problematic moments are the result of pressures women are subjected to in our society. The way Bridget acts feels more realistic than some characters who are the perfect feminist who deals with everything in the best way.",
      "What have you learnt through Bridget about the importance of friendships?",
      "Noor: I don't think I could've got through the numerous crises of my 20s without having a close group of female friends around me, as Bridget does. Nowadays, there are probably fewer Friday pub trips after work, and more meeting up for yoga and spin, but the overall message is the same: choose your friends wisely as they're the ones who will be there when everything else goes wrong.",
      "Sophie T: That friendship will always be there through the ups and downs of romantic life: to laugh at the failures and be there to comfort you when you need it. Bridget's interactions with her friends are the same as mine. We're always catching up over a meal and drink to moan about life - though there's a little less smoking these days.",
      "Yasmin: Find yourself friends that will eat your blue celery soup! Instead of going for drinks at a fancy London bar and getting a black cab home, we often split a bottle of cheap Tesco wine at one of our crammed and crumbly flats. But really, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's just about having a supportive group of friends who can tell you when it's time to ditch your toxic Daniel Cleaver-esque situationship.",
      "What did Bridget teach you about your career?",
      "Sophie T: Whenever I'm in a work situation where I'm meeting new people, I genuinely always picture the scene from the film where Bridget's trying to introduce people to each other with a fact about the other person and messes it up.",
      "The iconic scene when she tells her boss Daniel she's quitting has also always stuck with me. During times when I've had to deal with sexism in my career and have battled it head on, I'd like to imagine R-E-S-P-E-C-T was playing in the background.",
      "Noor: Don't send emails before proof reading, don't try and use language you don't understand. Oh, and don't sleep with your boss.",
      "Sophie G: It's okay to try something new and put yourself out there, regardless of your age or where you think you should be in your career at a certain point. Bridget's fear of public speaking has definitely resonated with me in the past, but knowing I'll never have to present in front of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Salman Rushdie is a comforting thought.",

    "summary": "The fine over the deaths of Adele O'Sullivan, Kahlani Rawson and Quinn Parker is the largest for an NHS trust in maternity care.",
    "story": [
      "An NHS trust has been fined \u00a31.6m for \"avoidable failings\" connected to the deaths of three babies in 2021.",
      "Adele O'Sullivan, Kahlani Rawson and Quinn Parker died shortly after they were born - all within 14 weeks of each other - while under the care of Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust.",
      "The trust admitted six counts of failing to provide safe care and treatment to the babies and their mothers on Monday, following a prosecution brought by the healthcare watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC).",
      "On Wednesday, family members cried in the courtroom as district judge Grace Leong expressed her \"deepest sympathy\" to each of them, and said the trust they put in NUH to deliver their babies safely had been broken.",
      "Adele died at just 26 minutes old on 7 April 2021, Kahlani died aged four days old on 15 June, and Quinn was two days old when he died on 16 July.",
      "In a statement read out on behalf of Quinn's parents outside Nottingham Magistrates' Court, lawyer Natalie Cosgrove said the prosecution would not bring him back \"but although he never spoke, he has a voice, and it has been firmly heard\".",
      "\"Quinn died from a long list of failings and Emmie's life was put at risk,\" she said.",
      "\"Some failings so basic, that a passing stranger on the street would have provided better attention to, and quality of care.\"",
      "Sadie Simpson, on behalf of the families of Adele and Kahlani, added the prosecution \"must act as a turning point\", adding it was \"yet another acknowledgement of serious failures\".",
      "The fine is the largest ever for an NHS trust for maternity care, the CQC said, and the fifth maternity prosecution it has brought overall.",
      "It was reduced from \u00a35.5m, taking into account the trust's financial position and guilty pleas, the court heard.",
      "The judge said there were similarities among the \"catalogue of failures\" across the cases, in which all the mothers suffered a placental abruption, a serious condition in which the placenta starts to come away from the wall of the womb.",
      "Those failures, the court heard, included staff being inadequately trained or equipped to interpret cardiotocography (CTG) results - used to monitor foetal heart rate and mothers' contractions - a failure to expedite delivery of babies, failure to recognise serious conditions and a handover process that was not up to standard.",
      "The trust was placed in \"special measures\" following a CQC inspection in October 2020.",
      "Then, following another inspection in April 2021 in which inspectors found \"improvements\", Adele died the same month, followed by Kahlani and Quinn in June and July.",
      "'Grief remains raw'",
      "The judge told the hearing, which was attended by NUH chief executive Anthony May, that the failures were \"avoidable and should never have happened\".",
      "Of the babies' families, the judge added: \"They placed their trust in a system meant to protect expectant mothers and keep babies safe - and that trust was broken.",
      "\"Three and a half years have gone by, yet for the families no doubt their grief remains as raw as ever and a constant presence in their lives that is woven into every moment.",
      "\"It is very difficult, if not impossible, to move on from the failures of the trust and its maternity unit.",
      "\"The weight of what should have been done different will linger indefinitely.\"",
      "Adele was born prematurely following an emergency Caesarean after her mother, Daniela O'Sullivan, noticed bleeding and suffered abdominal pains.",
      "However, no vaginal examination was carried out and the court previously heard there was a delay in identifying that she was in labour.",
      "An inquest into Adele's death found a series of \"missed opportunities\" in her mother's treatment, but could not say whether or not they led to the baby's death.",
      "In Kahlani's case, his mother Ellise Rawson had complained of a lack of foetal movement days before she had to undergo an emergency Caesarean.",
      "The trust said in an interview under caution that it accepted the monitoring in her case was poor \"from the outset\" and that key information about her condition had not been passed on to consultants.",
      "A coroner said \"failings in care\" led to a 20-minute delay in carrying out an emergency Caesarean section.",
      "The court heard Emmie Studencki went to hospital four times before her son Quinn was born in July 2021 after suffering bleeding.",
      "On the final occasion, she called an ambulance after having a major antepartum haemorrhage.",
      "Prosecuting on behalf of the CQC, Ryan Donaghue told the court it was recorded by a paramedic that she lost about 1,200ml of blood but \"those records did not find their way to the hospital notes\".",
      "Quinn was \"pale and floppy\" when he was delivered by emergency Caesarean section, the court heard.",
      "An inquest found a series of errors contributed to his death.",
      "'Significant financial penalty'",
      "The trust is currently subject of the the largest maternity review of its kind in NHS history, with about 2,500 cases being looked at.",
      "It is the first trust to be prosecuted by the CQC more than once, after it was fined \u00a3800,000 in 2023 for failures in the care of Wynter Andrews, who died 23 minutes after being born at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham in September 2019.",
      "The court heard the trust has an average turnover of \u00a3612m, and the judge said she was \"acutely aware\" that all its funds as a publicly-funded body were accounted for and that the trust was currently operating at a deficit of about \u00a3100m.",
      "She said: \"I can't ignore the negative impact this will have... but the significant financial penalty has to be fixed to mark the gravity of these offences and hold the trust to account for their failings.\"",
      "At sentencing on Wednesday, the trust was also told to cover prosecution costs of \u00a367,755.23 and ordered to pay a surcharge of \u00a3190.",
      "Following the hearing, NUH chief executive Anthony May said: \"The mothers and families of these babies have had to endure things that no family should after the care provided by our hospitals failed them, and for that I am truly sorry.",
      "\"Today's judgement is against the trust, and I also apologise to staff who we let down when it came to providing the right environment and processes to enable them to do their jobs safely.\"",
      "He said the trust believed it now had a \"safer and more effective maternity service\", and hearing the families in court gave the trust more \"incentive\" to improve.",
      "Helen Rawlings, the CQC's director of operations in the Midlands, added: \"This is the second time we have prosecuted the trust for not providing safe care and treatment in its maternity services, and we will continue to monitor the trust closely to ensure they are making and embedding improvements so that women and babies receive the safe care they deserve.\"",

    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",

      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

    "story": [
      "A sperm donor who claims to have fathered more than 180 children has been used by a judge to warn of the dangers of unregulated sperm donation.",
      "Robert Charles Albon, who calls himself Joe Donor, claims to have fathered children all over the world from China to Australia after advertising online.",
      "But using him as a donor turned into a \"horror story\" for a couple after he took them to court as he wanted parental rights over their child.",

      "It is extremely rare for a parent in a family court case about children to be publicly identified but the family court judge said it was in the public interest in naming Mr Albon.",
      "In his judgement, Jonathan Furness KC said he wanted to protect women from the possible consequences of unregulated sperm donorship and from using Mr Albon.",
      "The baby in this case was conceived by syringe injection to a same-sex couple, although Mr Albon claimed to have had secret sex with the biological mother in the back of a car. That's a claim rejected by the judge.",
      "Cardiff Family Court heard that Mr Albon, who is in his 50s, was a \"stranger\" to the child and has only met them for 10 minutes when a few weeks old for a \"one-off\" photo.",
      "Mr Albon applied to the court for parental responsibility, to be named on the birth certificate and changes to the child's name.",
      "Mr Albon wanted the child's non-biological mother to be called \"auntie\" rather than mother, despite the fact she had acted as a parent from birth.",
      "Both mothers said the stress from the legal proceedings \u2013 which took more than two years - had been cited as a factor in the break down of their relationship.",
      "The court heard the biological mother suffered from anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts made worse by the case.",
      "The judgement - made in 2023, but only just published - said Mr Albon claimed he wanted to \"protect the welfare\" of the child when he was actually \"wholly self-centred\".",
      "Judge Furness concluded: \"They chose a sperm donor who advertised that he would leave it up to the mother as to whether there should be any contact.",
      "\"There was evidence from his own social media material that Albon has indicated that to be the position.\"",
      "The court found Mr Albon, who is originally from the United States but has been living in north-east England, started the family proceedings to support his immigration position to stay in the UK. That is something he denies.",
      "\"In reality he is a man who seeks to control,\" added Judge Furness.",
      "\"Women and children appear to be almost a commodity to him as he sets about increasing the number of his children around the globe \u2013 China, USA, Argentina, Australia and UK to name just some of the countries where he has fathered children.\"",
      "The judge in this case found \"no positive welfare benefit in changing the child's name\" and that direct contact between him and the child would not be in the child's best interests.",

      "Mr Albon advertises on social media accounts like Facebook and Instagram and donates through various methods including artificial insemination and more natural methods like sexual intercourse.",
      "In an interview with The Sun last August, he said: \"I've had about 180 live births and I've met about 60 of them.\"",
      "\"I might never see a lot of them, this has to do with the child's mothers relationship\u2026 it's my preference to have some sort of relationship.\"",
      "The non-biological mother said Mr Albon's insistence of having parental rights had been a \"nightmare and a horror story\".",
      "\"She believes that the world needs to know of the risks associated with unregulated sperm donation,\" said Judge Furness.",
      "\"The public and vulnerable women seeking to get pregnant should know that is the case and they risk a similar 'horror story'.\"",
      "The judge said he wanted \"to protect women from the potential consequences of unregulated sperm donorship, generally, but also from Joe Donor himself\".",
      "\"He is a man who intends to continue donating sperm and vulnerable women who are interested in such services should fully understand the risks of becoming involved with him,\" he added.",
      "The way he was giving sperm was unregulated as it was not through a licensed clinic, with no limits on the number of children, mandatory health checks or protection from legal rights as a parent.",
      "UK regulations say sperm from a single donor used through licensed clinics may only be used to create a maximum of 10 families.",
      "Mr Albon has previously spoken about his motive for donating. He claimed he wanted to help create life and it was insulting when people said he only did it for sex. He said he did not make any money from it and was often lucky to break even on travel expenses.",
      "Family Court proceedings are private although under a recent change in court rules  in England and Wales, reporters can attend and report certain information.",
      "Measures have been taken to ensure the child cannot be identified.",

    "story": [
      "It is a cold morning in the depths of winter.",
      "And I feel like I've left my sanity as well as my warm clothes in the changing room as I stride out to the edge of a reservoir in my swim shorts.",
      "A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, it's \"ice\" water swimming.",
      "How did I end up here?",
      "Well, I've become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system. My body has been the living embodiment of the \"quademic\" that the NHS spent all winter warning us about. It's been a relentless stream of colds and coughs and one explosive tummy.",
      "Our immune systems already do a fantastic job fighting viruses and other nasties. If I collected all the air I breathed out over the course of a minute it would contain 100 to 10,000 bacteria, 25,000 viruses and a single fungus, according to Prof John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London.",
      "\"You're breathing these things in all the time; there's just a swirling mass of pathogens [organisms that cause disease] in the air,\" he says.",
      "But there's plenty of foods, supplements and activities that are touted for their \"immune-boosting\" properties. Can we dial up our protection?",
      "Can a cold water swim stop you getting ill?",
      "And that's why I find myself wading out and pushing off for a chilling blast of breaststroke.",
      "The icy water is like fire on my skin and all my brain can think of is making it to the pontoon without needing help from the lifeguards.",
      "But studies have shown the adrenaline hit of the cold water does flood the blood stream with infection-fighting cells.",
      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",
      "And maybe instead of spending your money on the latest immune-boosting craze, she suggests thinking about ways of not getting infected in the first place so \"be careful who you socialise with\".",

      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",

      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",

      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",

      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",

      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",

      "The debate came at the end of a heavily choreographed media push by the Home Office, which saw the department publish photos of illegal immigrants being deported for the first time.",
      "Earlier on Monday, the Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants. They made 609 arrests - a 73% increase on the previous January.",

      "Under Labour's plans, a new Border Security Command will gain more powers and a new head, who will oversee closer links between intelligence, police, and border agents.",

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "story": [
      "A UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.",
      "Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.",
      "The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.",
      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",

      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",
      "He is understood to already be planning how best to deploy his ultimate line manager with officials considering inviting the president on a second state visit to London.",
      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",
      "\"Peter's great mission in life\", they say, \"is to stay relevant.\"",

      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",

      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:11:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The findings shed light on a deeply mysterious part of Earth that is key to life on our planet.",
    "story": [
      "The inner core of Earth may have changed shape in the past 20 years, according to a group of scientists.",
      "The inner core is usually thought to be shaped like a ball, but its edges may actually have deformed by 100m or more in height in places, according to Prof John Vidale who led the research.",
      "Earth's core is the beating heart of our planet as it produces a magnetic field that protects life from burning up in the Sun's radiation.",
      "The inner core spins independently from the liquid outer core and from the rest of the planet. Without this motion, Earth would die and become more like barren Mars which lost its magnetic field billions of years ago.",
      "The change in shape could be happening where the edge of the solid inner core touches the extremely hot liquid metal outer core.",
      "The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists were originally trying to find out why the inner core may have slowed down to a slower pace than Earth's rotation before speeding back up again in 2010.",
      "Understanding how the Earth's core works is essential to understanding the magnetic field that protects the planet, and whether that could weaken or stop.",
      "The inside of our planet is an extremely mysterious place. The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.",
      "So, to try to unlock its secrets, some researchers measure the shockwaves caused by earthquakes as they ripple through the planet.",
      "The way the waves travel reveals what type of material they moved through, including in the inner core, and help to paint a picture of what lies beneath our feet.",
      "The new analysis looked at seismic wave patterns from earthquakes that repeated  in the same location between 1991 and 2023. That helped to show how the inner core is changing over time.",
      "Prof Vidale, an earth scientist at the University of Southern California, found more evidence to back up the theory that during those years the inner core slowed down around 2010.",
      "But his team also found the evidence of the inner core's changing shape.",
      "It appears to be happening at the boundary of the inner and outer core, where the inner core is close to melting point. The liquid flow of the outer core as well as pull from an uneven gravity field may cause deformation.",
      "Prof Hrvoje Tkalcic from Australian National University, who was not involved in the study, said the paper provides \"an interesting concept that should be explored further\".",
      "He said it could allow scientists \"to make more informed estimates of some important material properties, such as the viscosity of the inner core, which is one of the least known quantities in modern science\".",
      "Over time the liquid outer core is freezing into the solid inner core, but it will be billions of years before it becomes completely solid.",
      "It would almost certainly mean the end of life on Earth, but by then the planet is already likely to have been swallowed by the Sun.",
      "Prof Vidale's work is part of investigations by experts around the world exploring and arguing over what happens in the core.",
      "\"In science, we generally try to look at things until we understand them,\" Prof Vidale says.",
      "\"In all likelihood, this finding doesn't affect our daily lives one iota, but we really want to understand what's happening in the middle of the Earth,\" he adds.",
      "It is possible that the changes are connected to changes in Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"The magnetic field has had jerks at various times in the past few decades, and we'd like to know if that is related to what we're seeing at the inner core boundary,\" he said.",
      "Prof Vidale urged caution about hyping the findings into ideas that the core is going to stop rotating any time soon.",
      "He also added that there are still lots of uncertainties.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure we're interpreting these changes correctly,\" saying that the boundaries of scientific knowledge are always changing and, like many if not all researchers, he has been wrong in the past."

    "summary": "The government has agreed a new subsidy arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station in north Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:49:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has agreed a new subsidy arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station in north Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",

    "summary": "The Public Accounts Committee warns the government of gambling public money on carbon capture.",
    "story": [
      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",
      "His committee recommended that any future contracts be changed to include profit-sharing mechanisms.",
      "The government said that it expected the \u00a321.7bn funding for CCUS to unlock \u00a38bn in private sector investment over the next 25 years.",
      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

      "The government has said they face \"imminent risk\" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.",
      "The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.",
      "\"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,\" says Delfino. \"Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.",
      "House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.",

      "On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.",
      "Mr Paton says, \"it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise\".",
      "However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.",
      "The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Mart\u00ednez, fear the rising sea:",

    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 20:23:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The government wants to make it quicker and easier to build mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to \"build baby build\", as he announced plans to make it easier to construct mini nuclear power stations in England and Wales.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC the government was going to \"take on the blockers\" and change planning rules so new reactors could be built in more parts of the country.",
      "Sir Keir said he wanted the country to return to being \"one of the world leaders on nuclear\", helping to create thousands of highly skilled jobs and boosting economic growth.",
      "Unions and business groups welcomed the move, but some environmentalists criticised the government, saying it had \"swallowed nuclear industry spin whole\".",
      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",
      "However, while there are some 80 different designs under development globally, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the concept has yet to be proven commercially.",
      "The plans announced on Thursday mark the first time SMRs will be included in planning rules. A list of the only places a nuclear reactor could be built - made up of just eight sites - will also be scrapped.",
      "Is nuclear power gaining new energy?",
      "How 'green' and safe is nuclear power?",
      "Starmer goes nuclear in hunt for long-term growth",
      "Sir Keir said the plans would improve the country's energy security by increasing the supply of clean, homegrown power.",
      "He added that Britain had been \"held hostage\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin for \"too long\", which has resulted in energy prices \"skyrocketing at his whims\".",
      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",
      "While the overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build.",
      "The head of the Nuclear Industry Association, Tom Greatrex, said the changes would give investors certainty and enable them to get on with building new plants.",
      "Gary Smith, GMB's general secretary, said the union has repeatedly said \"there can be no net zero without new nuclear\".",
      "The previous Conservative government gave the go-ahead for a new nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast - Sizewell C - in 2022.",
      "The new Labour government committed a further \u00a32.7bn to the project in October but a final decision on its future is not due to come until the spending review later this year.",
      "Two new nuclear reactors are also being built at Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which are due to open in 2030.",

      "An international law firm has blocked general access to several artificial intelligence (AI) tools after it found a \"significant increase in usage\" by its staff.",
      "In an email seen by the BBC, a senior director of Hill Dickinson, which employs more than a thousand people across the world, warned staff of the use of AI tools.",
      "The firm said much of the usage was not in line with its AI policy, and going forward the firm would only allow staff to access the tools via a request process.",
      "A spokesperson from the Information Commissioner's Office - the UK's data watchdog - told BBC News that firms should not discourage the use of AI in work.",
      "The spokesperson added:  \"With AI offering people countless ways to work more efficiently and effectively, the answer cannot be for organisations to outlaw the use of AI and drive staff to use it under the radar.",
      "\"Instead, companies need to offer their staff AI tools that meet their organisational policies and data protection obligations.\"",
      "In the email, Hill Dickinson's chief technology officer said the law firm had detected more than 32,000 hits to the popular chatbot ChatGPT over a seven-day period in January and February.",
      "During the same timeframe, there were also more than 3,000 hits to the Chinese AI service DeepSeek, which was recently banned from Australian government devices over security concerns.",

      "'Positively embrace' use of AI",
      "Hill Dickinson, who have offices in several parts of England and abroad, later told BBC News: \"Like many law firms, we are aiming to positively embrace the use of AI tools to enhance our capabilities while always ensuring safe and proper use by our people and for our clients.\"",

      "The firm is now only granting access to AI tools via a request process. It is understood that some requests have already been received and approved.",
      "Ian Jeffery, chief executive of the Law Society of England and Wales, told BBC News that AI \"could improve the way we do things a great deal\".",
      "He added AI tools \"need human oversight\", and the organisation will support legal colleagues and the public \"as they navigate this brave new digital world and make justice fair, equal and accessible for all\".",
      "A spokesperson from the Solicitors Regulation Authority, which regulates solicitors in England and Wales, told BBC News: \"Despite this increased interest in new technology, there remains a lack of digital skills across all sectors in the UK.",
      "\"This could present a risk for firms and consumers if legal practitioners do not fully understand the new technology that is implemented.\"",
      "According to a survey of 500 UK solicitors by legal software provider Clio in September, 62% anticipated an increase in AI usage over the following 12 months.",
      "It found law firms across the UK were using the technology to complete tasks such as drafting documents, reviewing or analysing contracts and legal research.",
      "A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson described AI as a \"technological leap\" that will \"free workers from repetitive tasks and unlock more rewarding opportunities\".",

      "Elon Musk denied leading a \"hostile takeover\" of the US government and defended his cost-cutting plans as he made a surprise first appearance at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "The world's richest man took questions from reporters in the Oval Office as he stood next to President Donald Trump, who has tasked him with slashing the size and spending of the federal government.",
      "Trump then signed an order giving Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) more authority to cut the federal workforce. It instructed the heads of government agencies to comply with Doge.",

      "Speaking at a defence summit in Brussels, Hegseth said it would only be possible to establish a \"durable peace\" with a \"realistic assessment of the battlefield\".",
      "During an uncompromising speech, he also downplayed the prospect of Ukraine joining Nato, ruled out deploying US troops to Ukraine under any future security arrangement and said European nations needed to spend much more on defence.",
      "The Nato military alliance has previously pledged Kyiv an \"irreversible path\" to membership.",
      "Hegseth's comments will be met with dismay in Ukraine - which has repeatedly called for Nato membership and has rejected ceding territory as part of any peace deal - and will be welcomed by Moscow.",
      "The new US defence secretary's remarks are also the clearest indication yet of the Trump administration's position on the Ukraine war and what a peace plan to end the conflict could involve.",
      "There will also be nervousness across the continent after Hegseth suggested the US would significantly scale back its support for Ukraine, insisting that European nations would now need to provide the \"overwhelming share\" of aid to Kyiv.",
      "Hegseth, who was appointed defence secretary after Donald Trump returned to the US presidency in January, was speaking at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, a meeting of more than 40 countries allied to Ukraine.",

      "The US currently spends roughly 3.4% of its GDP on defence, while the UK spends about 2.3%. Countries closer to Russia, like Poland and the Baltic states, spend the most proportionately at around 4%.",

    "summary": "The world's richest man took questions for the first time since he was appointed to lead a sweeping government cost-cutting effort.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk denied leading a \"hostile takeover\" of the US government and defended his cost-cutting plans as he made a surprise first appearance at the White House on Tuesday.",
      "The world's richest man took questions from reporters in the Oval Office as he stood next to President Donald Trump, who has tasked him with slashing the size and spending of the federal government.",
      "Trump then signed an order giving Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) more authority to cut the federal workforce. It instructed the heads of government agencies to comply with Doge.",
      "The agency has been criticised by Democrats who have accused it of a lack of transparency, and its efforts have also been hampered by legal challenges.",
      "Doge has, for example, been blocked by a federal judge from accessing treasury records - in a case that seeks to ensure the agency does not interfere with funding signed off by Congress, which is outside Doge's scope.",
      "But Musk, who was questioned by reporters for the first time since Trump took office last month, described sweeping government cuts as \"common sense\" measures that are \"not draconian or radical\".",
      "\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" he said. \"That's what democracy is all about.\"",
      "\"I fully expect to be scrutinised,\" he added. \"It's not like I think I can get away with something.\"",

      "Who is Elon Musk and what is his net worth?",
      "What is Doge, Trump's new team headed by Elon Musk?",
      "The billionaire technology entrepreneur, who himself was appointed and not elected, described federal workers as an \"unelected, fourth, unconstitutional branch of government\" that he said has \"more power than any elected representative\".",
      "The 53-year-old owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX wore a black Make America Great Again cap and cracked the occasional joke with reporters who asked him about his critics. He had his young son, named X \u00c6 A-Xii - or X for short - on his shoulders for part of the news conference.",
      "\"It's not optional for us to reduce the federal expenses,\" Musk said. \"It's essential. It's essential for America to remain solvent as a country.\"",
      "Musk was also asked about a recent false claim that the US government was sending millions of dollars worth of condoms to Gaza. \"Some of the things that I say will be incorrect and should be corrected,\" Musk replied.",
      "In the first weeks of Trump's term, Musk has spearheaded the effort to rapidly shrink the federal government. Doge representatives have entered various departments to monitor spending, offered millions of workers an exit route and moved to freeze federal funding as well as the work of agencies such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID).",
      "\"We found fraud and abuse,\" Trump said of Musk's work on Tuesday, without providing evidence. He estimated more than $1 trillion in wasteful spending would be discovered although gave no further details.",

      "The vast cost-cutting drive has been criticised repeatedly by opponents including senior Democrats and those who say it will have significant repercussions both in the US and internationally.",
      "\"An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said recently. He said Democrats would work to block Musk's efforts by introducing specific language into spending bills.",
      "But with Republicans holding a majority in both chambers of Congress, Trump's agenda has faced more pressing hurdles in the courtroom.",
      "\"I hope that the court system is going to allow us to do what we have to do,\" Trump said on Tuesday, referring to recent judgments that have temporarily halted his efforts to shrink government, including through an employee buyout programme.",
      "Critics of Doge have also pointed to potential conflicts of interest given Musk's many business interests. Democrats have accused him of personally benefiting from some of the changes the Trump administration is trying to push through.",
      "Musk said the public could take its own view about potential conflicts. Trump then said if the White House thought there was a lack of transparency or a conflict of interest, \"we would not let him do that segment or look in that area\".",
      "Trump then signed an executive order instructing Doge to \"significantly\" cut down the size of the federal workforce. The order also calls on government offices to \"undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force\".",
      "It also says that once a hiring freeze that Trump signed on his first day ends, that agencies should hire no more than one person for every four who depart.",
      "A recent poll by the BBC's US partner CBS News indicated a majority of Americans are in favour of Musk's work, but disagree over how much influence he should have.",
      "It suggested Republicans in particular supported his efforts to cut federal spending and foreign aid.",
      "The poll indicated largely favourable ratings for Trump's policies, however, some 66% of people said they wanted him to focus more on lowering prices.",
      "One of the agencies that has been most affected by the cost-cutting drive is USAID.",
      "On Tuesday, the inspector general of the agency was fired - one day after releasing a report criticising plans to put the vast majority of the agency's staff on leave and close US-backed aid programmes around the world.",

    "story": [
      "A Russian national imprisoned in a US jail on money laundering charges will be freed in exchange for the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel from prison in Russia, authorities have confirmed.",
      "Mr Fogel, a 63-year-old former diplomat, landed at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington, DC late on Tuesday evening, before he was welcomed home by President Donald Trump at the White House.",
      "Trump, standing alongside Mr Fogel in the White House, said: \"To me he looks damned good.\"",
      "The president said that another detainee would be freed on Wednesday without giving their name.",
      "Mr Fogel, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had been working as a teacher at the Anglo-American School of Moscow. He had previously worked as a diplomat at the US embassy there.",
      "While in prison, he reportedly taught English to fellow inmates.",
      "Mr Fogel flew back to the US with Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "After landing on US soil, the White House posted on X: \"PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT!\" along with a picture of Mr Fogel.",
      "President Trump told reporters the release was a \"show of good faith\" from the Russians and that it \"could be a big important part\" of ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "\"We were treated very nicely by Russia,\" he said. \"Actually, I hope that's the beginning of a relationship where we can end that war and millions of people can stop being killed.\"",
      "Trump's Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, told US network NewsNation that while the deal to get Mr Fogel released was a \"good sign\", he cautioned against \"linking\" it to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people, the majority of them soldiers, are believed to have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday that while such agreements build trust between countries, they were unlikely to be a \"turning point\" in a relationship.",
      "Peskov said he would not name the Russian who was being released as part of the exchange until they had returned home.",
      "But US officials have identified the man as Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 and extradited to the US.",
      "Vinnik, who operated cryptocurrency exchange BTC-e, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in 2024.",
      "Trump said earlier that the prisoner deal with Russia was \"very fair, very reasonable\", and that \"somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of\".",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who flew back from Russia with Mr Fogel, disclosed that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was \"instrumental\" in the release and a \"cheerleader\" for the deal.",
      "\"Behind the scenes, he was encouraging, pushing and looking for the right result,\" he said. \"He was helpful, he really was.\"",
      "Speaking to Reuters news agency, sources familiar with the negotiations confirmed that Salman was involved, along with Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund.",
      "\"I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now,\" said Mr Fogel. \"I'm a middle-class school teacher who's now in a dream world.\"",
      "Mr Fogel's sister, Anne Fogel, told the BBC that her brother, who was detained in Russia in 2021, was moved last Wednesday from a penal colony in Rybinsk. She said the family had known his release was a possibility but also that the negotiations were \"very tenuous\".",
      "In a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, his wife Jane and sons Ethan and Sam said: \"This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Mr Fogel was arrested at an airport for illegal possession of cannabis in 2021.",
      "He was charged with carrying a small amount of medical marijuana, which had been prescribed in the US, and given a 14-year prison sentence.",
      "Mr Fogel's legal team thanked Trump for his role in the negotiation and criticised what they called the \"bureaucratic inaction\" of the Biden administration.",
      "\"President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home,\" a statement from his lawyers, also sent to CBS, said.",
      "Mr Fogel was not classed by the US government as wrongfully detained until December 2024, despite beginning his sentence in 2022.",
      "His family had tried to push former President Joe Biden to secure his release, and were left disappointed when he was left out of prisoner exchanges in 2022 and 2024.",
      "US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was arrested in Russia on a similar charge of cannabis possession in 2022, was freed in an exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout 10 months later.",
      "Subsequently, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans last year as part of the biggest prisoner exchange between Russia and the West since the Cold War. The Americans freed were Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, US Marine veteran Paul Whelan, and Russian-American radio journalist Alsu Kurmasheva.",
      "Anne Fogel told the BBC at the time of feeling \"betrayal\" when she learnt that her brother was not included in the prisoner exchange - which Biden had lauded as a \"feat of diplomacy\".",
      "At least 10 Americans remain in prison in Russia. They include Gordon Black - a US army staff sergeant who flew to Vladivostok to see his girlfriend and was then accused of stealing from her - and Robert Woodland, who was adopted from Russia as a child and was working as an English teacher when he was convicted of drugs offences.",
      "Witkoff's trip to Russia is the first by a senior US official to the country in a number of years. Most contact between the nations was shut off following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Waltz said Mr Fogel's release was a \"sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine\". He did not provide further details.",

      "Asked by the BBC about the link made by officials between the release and the conflict in Ukraine, Anne Fogel said: \"These are the giant machinations of world politics at play. It's going to be interesting to look back at this and to see how this all fits in and\u2026 how history plays out.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 01:24:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The oil giant faces allegations it ignored warnings that a clean-up scheme was beset by corruption.",
    "story": [
      "A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.",
      "The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.",
      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",
      "It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.",
      "The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago.",
      "The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.",
      "The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.",
      "Grace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case.",
      "Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, \u00a32.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.",
      "It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.",
      "Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.",
      "\"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said.",
      "Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.",
      "\"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.",
      "\"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\"",
      "In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.",
      "It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.",
      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",
      "This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.",
      "Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.",
      "However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.",
      "One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.",
      "\"It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people,\" the whistleblower said.",
      "\"It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power.\"",
      "The allegations about failings at Hyprep include:",
      "Contracts being awarded to companies that had no relevant experienceLaboratory results being falsified - sometimes labelling contaminated soil and water as cleanProject costs being inflatedExternal auditors on occasion being blocked from checking the clean-up on sites had been done properly.",

      "Project costs being inflated",
      "External auditors on occasion being blocked from checking the clean-up on sites had been done properly.",
      "In the minutes of one meeting in 2023, attended by representatives from Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the UNEP and Hyprep, it was pointed out that \"incompetent\" contractors were \"being engaged again\" and that they should \"not be allowed to further degrade the environment\".",
      "In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".",
      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"",
      "This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.",
      "In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.",
      "The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.",
      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",
      "Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".",
      "\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.",
      "\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"",
      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",
      "Some locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.",
      "They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.",
      "\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.",
      "\"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.",
      "\"It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account.\"",
      "Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region.",
      "Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as \"black gold\", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.",

    "story": [
      "Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her government tried to cling on to power using systematic, deadly violence against protesters that could amount to \"crimes against humanity\", the UN has said.",
      "UN human rights investigators accused the deposed government of a brutal response to mass opposition last year, in which they said up to 1,400 people had been killed, mostly by security forces.",
      "The UN team said \"an official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters\" had been directed by political leaders and senior security officials.",
      "Hasina, who had been in office for 15 years, fled by helicopter to India shortly before crowds stormed her residence last August.",
      "The unrest began as student-led protests against quotas in civil service jobs and escalated into a countrywide movement to oust Hasina and her Awami League party following a deadly police crackdown. Thousands more were injured in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971.",
      "The UN investigators' findings show the then government, including Sheikh Hasina, \"were aware of and involved in very serious offences\", UN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk told a news conference in Geneva.",
      "\"Among our key findings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that officials of the former government, its security and intelligence apparatus, together with violent elements associated with the former ruling party, committed serious and systematic human rights violations,\" Mr T\u00fcrk said.",
      "The UN investigators documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture.",
      "Children, too, were targeted \u2013 the report estimates up to 13% of the 1,400 people killed between between 1 July and 15 August were children.",
      "\"The brutal response was a calculated and well-co-ordinated strategy by the former government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition,\" Mr T\u00fcrk said.",
      "He said the evidence gathered by his office painted \"a disturbing picture of rampant state violence and targeted killings\".",
      "\"There are reasonable grounds to believe hundreds of extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture, were carried out with the knowledge, co-ordination and direction of the political leadership and senior security officials as part of a strategy to suppress the protests.\"",
      "The report was requested by Bangladesh's caretaker leader, Muhammad Yunus, who said he and his interim government remained \"committed to transforming Bangladesh into a country in which all its people can live in security and dignity\".",
      "The overall number of deaths given by the UN team is far higher than the 834 most recently estimated by his government.",
      "The UN team that compiled the report included human rights investigators, a forensics physician and a weapons expert. Their findings are mainly based on more than 230 interviews with survivors, witnesses and others. They were given access to medical case files, photos, videos and other material.",
      "\"Former senior officials directly involved in handling the protests and other inside sources described how the former prime minister and other senior officials directed and oversaw a series of large-scale operations, in which security and intelligence forces shot and killed protesters or arbitrarily arrested and tortured them,\" the report said.",
      "It \"found patterns of security forces deliberately and impermissibly killing or maiming protesters, including incidents where people were shot at point-blank range\".",
      "Mohammad Ali Arafat, a former minister in Sheikh Hasina's cabinet tasked wth negotiating with demonstrators, rejected the report's findings, saying it was \"preposterous\" to suggest she had ordered protest leaders to be killed.",
      "\"The problem with relying on 'testimonies' from unnamed security officials at this time is their utter unreliability,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"These security officials, who themselves are in the dock for the alleged rights violations, would naturally point fingers at whoever the current government in Bangladesh wants to implicate.",
      "\"The UN would be mistaken to rely on such 'cut-throat' defences.\"",
      "While the report attributes most of the violence to government security forces, it also raises concerns about attacks on those perceived to be supporters of the former government, and against some religious and ethnic groups.",

    "story": [
      "When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later this week, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all.",
      "Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances.",
      "Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership.",
      "Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi.",
      "And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place.",
      "Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community.",
      "He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India.",
      "And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands.",
      "Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil.",
      "It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration.",
      "Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years. But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides.",
      "In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.",
      "Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger.",
      "Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil.",
      "In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US.",
      "Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel.",
      "India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment.",
      "Technology will probably be discussed as well.",
      "This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it.",
      "Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will.",
      "Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.",
      "Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large.",
      "Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran, which hints at removing sanctions waivers for those conducting commercial activities in Chabahar. Modi may seek clarity on what this means for Delhi.",
      "Trump may also gauge Modi's position on a big foreign policy priority: ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Delhi has a strong interest in these wars winding down. Modi's position on the war in Ukraine - calling for an end to the conflict without criticising Putin or Russia - echoes that of Trump.",
      "India's special relationship with Russia and close ties with Israel may prompt Trump to see if Modi would want to play a third-party mediator role as well. Modi would probably be comfortable doing so only if the parties are receptive to outside mediation.",
      "But despite some potentially delicate discussions this week, both leaders will want to maintain a positive tone.",
      "In that regard, the Indo-Pacific Quad will be just what the doctor ordered.",
      "Trump strongly backs this group which consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia and focuses on countering Beijing.",
      "In his first term, Trump elevated the Quad's annual meetings to the foreign minister level and Biden elevated them further to the leaders' level.",
      "India is scheduled to host this year's Quad meeting and Modi may invite Trump to Delhi to attend this.",
      "Trump reportedly is not a big fan of international travel but India is a trip he will probably be keen to make - to deepen his personal relationship with Modi and to advance a multifaceted bilateral partnership that extends well beyond the transactionalism that will carry the day in Washington this week.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 22:49:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The way medicines are selected for use in public hospitals is under scrutiny after doctors raised concerns.",
    "story": [
      "Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government.",
      "Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety.",
      "But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality.",
      "One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had \"mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings\".",
      "The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies. It is the latest challenge to a healthcare system that is already under enormous strain because of a rapidly ageing population.",
      "How did it all begin?",
      "The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals. Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals.",
      "This intensified in January, when, in a video interview that went viral, the director of a hospital department in Shanghai, shared his concerns about the drug procurement system.",
      "Zheng Minhua cited \"antibiotics that cause allergies, blood pressure that won't go down, anaesthetised patients who won't sleep\" and laxatives that did not clear the bowel as being among the issues that had been encountered.",
      "Dr Zheng's words immediately struck a chord and have been condensed into a social media slogan that has been viewed by millions in the past month - though much of the discussion of the topic has since been censored on Weibo. Many people have come forward to share their own bad experiences with alleged substandard drugs.",
      "\"I underwent intestinal surgeries in 2024, which required me to consume laxatives beforehand,\" one Weibo user wrote. They said the drugs they were given had \"no effect whatsoever\", even after the dose was doubled, and that they had to turn to drinking coffee to help clear their bowel.",
      "The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them.",
      "A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the \"original\" \"real\" one, since the generic version \"tasted different\".",
      "\"There have been many people catching colds recently. A lot of them might have bought this drug. Quickly send reminders to your friends now and get them to check the brand before buying,\" the user warned.",
      "Some of the most popular posts discussing the procurement controversy have been taken down, though it is unclear by whom. China's heavily monitored internet has a strong culture of censorship by both authorities and users themselves.",
      "In a scathing, now-removed post by popular podcast host Meng Chang, he lambasted the lack of imported drugs in the public sector: \"If this isn't a bottom line, I don't know what is.\"",
      "Public anger has also been focussed on the difficulties of accessing imported drugs that people believe to be of better quality.",
      "In response to authorities' attempt to reassure people of the quality of generic drugs, one Weibo user wrote: \"As long as we are allowed to buy brand-name drugs ourselves, I have no other complaints.\"",
      "How does the drug procurement system work?",
      "It was introduced in 2018 as a way to lower state expenditure on medicines and involves local governments putting out tender processes for around 70% of state hospitals' annual drug requirements.",
      "Various drug manufacturers then compete to offer the lowest prices for drugs to win these lucrative contracts.",
      "This gives an advantage to domestically-produced generic drugs, which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as original patented drugs but are often several times cheaper to make as they do not include the high costs of research and development.",
      "China has emerged as one of the world's largest players in the global generic pharmaceutical market, exporting both finished products to consumers abroad and key ingredients to foreign companies. At home, thousands of generic drug manufacturers compete to sell their products at competitive prices in the expanding domestic market.",
      "For generic medicines to be eligible for China's procurement process, they have to be tested and determined to be similar enough to the brand-name version of the drug.",
      "Beijing has credited the drugs procurement system with saving millions of residents more than $50bn (\u00a340bn) in its first five years.",
      "But the procurement process has seen some drug manufacturers offer medicines at incredibly low prices. One of the winning bids last December was an aspirin tablet selling for less than one cent.",
      "\"Are drug tablets that cost less than one cent edible?\" became a trending topic on Weibo at the time.",
      "\"The manufacturers that win the bids often set prices so low that they may struggle to produce high quality drugs with the correct ingredients, potentially leading to ineffective medications,\" Stacy Zhang, associate professor at NYU Langone Health, told the BBC.",
      "She added that while the procurement system \"was not designed to restrict access to imported brand-name drugs\", it may still have \"affected their accessibility\".",
      "Questions over data and efficacy",
      "A proposal submitted by 20 doctors, including Dr Zheng, to Shanghai authorities last month stated that \"there are widespread concerns in the industry that procurement prices are too low, prompting unethical companies to cut corners to reduce costs, affecting the efficacy of drugs\".",
      "\"Doctors are helpless because they have no choice, and there is no channel to escalate feedback.\"",
      "A recent article by  Xia Zhimin, a doctor in Hangzhou, has added to the scrutiny. In it, he highlighted what he said was questionable data from the trials of generic drugs on the procurement list - it was identical to the data from the original drug on which it was based. Dr Xia suggested that it could be evidence of fraud.",
      "The National Medical Products Administration responded by saying his findings were due to an \"editorial error\". His article has since been removed.",
      "Adding to quality concerns are counterfeit drugs, which have seeped into both generic and brand-name drugs markets across the world and are notoriously difficult to detect. The World Health Organization has described this a global health problem.",
      "\"To enhance affordability, the introduction of cost-effective generics is essential,\" Kevin Lu, associate professor at the University of South Carolina's College of Pharmacy, told the BBC.",
      "He added that the procurement process needed \"strengthened quality control\" and \"continued improvements in drug approval and manufacturing standards\".",
      "A sector in crisis",
      "The controversy comes at a time when China's healthcare system is already under mounting pressure.",
      "A rapidly ageing population has meant that the country's total health expenditure has increased nearly 20-fold over the last 20 years, reaching 9 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion; \u00a31 trillion) in 2023.",
      "Across the country, public medical insurance funds are running thin. Deficits have already appeared in some provinces, where local governments that had relied heavily on land sales for revenue are now struggling with debt as a real estate crisis engulfs China's economy.",
      "At the same time, the healthcare system has been experiencing a trust crisis. Violent attacks against medical staff have risen since the 2000s, fuelled by anger at the lack of resources and an erosion of faith in doctors.",
      "Unlike issues that have been deemed politically sensitive and heavily censored by authorities, such as the persecution of political dissidents or the suppression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the ongoing controversy surrounding the procurement of drugs has at least been acknowledged by the state as a problem to be tackled.",
      "The National Healthcare Security Administration said in a statement on 19 January that authorities \"attached great importance\" to these safety concerns and would seek feedback on the drug procurement policy.",
      "\"It is undeniable that the national centralised procurement is still in its infancy. There are many pharmaceutical companies with varying production quality,\" state media Life Times quoted a public health scholar as saying. Other experts cited in the article called for drug evaluation standards to be improved.",
      "As authorities try to remedy the procurement system's faltering image, all the scrutiny is now overshadowing a system designed to be a win-win: saving lives and also saving money.",
      "As one Weibo user argued, the savings from lower drug prices are but \"a drop in a bucket\" of China's national healthcare costs. On the other hand, they wrote, allowing potentially defective drugs to be widely used is akin to \"drinking poison to quench thirst\".",

    "title": "Germany's once-mighty car industry is in crisis. What will it take to fix it?",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "summary": "A judge accused the Trump administration of defying his orders, setting up a battle that could end up at the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "In the first weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump has wasted no time in flexing his political muscle. That much is clear.",
      "Since taking office in January, he has ordered the suspension of all new asylum claims, cancelled refugee resettlement, frozen government hiring and spending, gutted agencies established by Congress, moved to ban gender transition care for teenagers and offered a buyout deal for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "The whirlwind of unilateral action on his campaign promises has pushed the limits of presidential power \u2013 and prompted legal challenges from Democrats, unions and legal groups.",
      "So far the federal courts have been the only substantive roadblocks to Trump's agenda, as judges have temporarily suspended some of his most contentious actions, including a bid to end automatic citizenship for anyone born on US soil - a right established from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.",
      "But Trump is pressing on - and seems headed for a showdown with the judiciary that could eventually end in the highest court in the land. This week, a Rhode Island judge said the Trump administration was clearly and openly defying his court order to unfreeze billions in federal funds. The White House responded by saying that \"every action\" the president took was \"completely lawful\".",
      "Vance questions authority of US judges to challenge Trump",
      "Judge blocks Trump plan to put thousands of USAID staff on leave",
      "Judge blocks Trump's bid to restrict birthright citizenship",
      "If Trump's orders do reach the US Supreme Court, six of the nine justices there - including three appointed by Trump in his first term - are conservative. Just last term, the court issued a decision holding Trump, and all future presidents, largely immune from prosecution for official actions while in office.",
      "At the time, it was a landmark expansion of presidential authority. But some observers have suggested that Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his powers even further.",
      "Trump's move to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and dismantle the United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), on their face, run afoul of the checks-and-balances system of US government.",
      "Congress, rather than the White House, holds the authority to control federal spending and taxation - what's known as \"the power of the purse\". Legislators also established USAID and lawsuits have been filed arguing that Trump has no legal authority to dismantle it and refuse to spend funds allocated by Congress.",
      "But if the high courts agree to uphold some of his sweeping executive actions, it could strengthen his ability to transform the government and enact policy changes without the help of Congress.",
      "And even if the courts rule against the president, says Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Manhattan Institute, those legal defeats might be politically advantageous.",
      "\"There could be political benefits to being challenged in court and then even losing in court because then you can run against judges and make political hay of it.\"",
      "There is another scenario, however. Trump could simply refuse to comply with any court that tries to stop his exercise of unfettered presidential power.",
      "In Oval Office comments on Tuesday, the president hinted that this might be an option, in his typically oblique way.",
      "\"We want to weed out the corruption,\" Trump said. \"And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that.\"",
      "\"Maybe we have to look at the judges,\" he continued. \"I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, was even more blunt.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he posted on the social media site X. That view was similar to one Vance expressed in a 2021 podcast, when he said that if Trump returned to power he should refuse to comply with any court order that prevented him from firing federal workers.",
      "Directly defying a court ruling, however, would cut against centuries of US history and amount to the opening skirmishes in a constitutional crisis that pits the president against the branch of government designed to establish and interpret the law of the land.",
      "\"My read is that President Trump is testing the outer boundaries of what he might be able to get away with, doing a lot of things that are blatantly against the law and maybe some things that are closer to the line,\" said Fred Smith, a professor at the Emory University School of Law.",
      "\"They are breaking a lot of norms,\" Mr Smith added of the nascent Trump administration. \"Why he is doing that, only he knows fully. But he is doing it.\"",
      "So far, Trump and his allies have made aggressive comments about unfavourable court decisions in the public and in legal filings, but have yet to be sanctioned for disobeying a court. When Trump was the target of multiple prosecutions over the past four years, he frequently questioned the legitimacy of the presiding judges, but his courtroom lawyers adhered to the law and legal procedures.",
      "The federal judge in Rhode Island, who had placed a temporary hold on another Trump order to freeze some federal spending, did warn in court filings Monday that the administration was violating his temporary restraining order but stopped short of finding them in contempt.",
      "Conservative legal scholar Ed Whelan wrote on X that it would be \"extremely grave\" for the Trump administration to defy a federal court order.",
      "\"I'm open to the argument that truly extraordinary circumstances (the makings of a wild hypothetical) might justify defiance,\" Mr Whelan wrote. \"But in our constitutional system there should be an overwhelming presumption in favour of executive-branch compliance with federal court orders.\"",
      "Should Trump disobey, and therefore delegitimise, the courts, the decision could come back to bite him when the time comes for the president to see his own lawful agenda enforced, some legal experts say. Democratic states like California, for instance, might be inclined to ignore White House directives and federal laws they don't like - and Trump would be hard pressed to use the courts to bring them to heel.",
      "\"If the executive decides it will obey some court orders but not others, it will find it won't get any court orders that it wishes to obey,\" said Philip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University Law School. \"I just don't think they thought that through.\"",
      "When Donald Trump redecorated the Oval Office to his liking in January, he reinstalled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson that had hung on the wall across from the Resolute Desk in his first term.",
      "The seventh US president is remembered for a critical moment of defiance against the United States Supreme Court. When the justices decided a dispute between the state of Georgia and Cherokee Indian governments in 1832, Jackson did not seem interested in following its direction.",
      "Jackson allegedly said of the Chief Justice's ruling, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"",
      "Nearly 200 years later, Trump himself has found himself on his own collision course with America's judiciary."

      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Who may turn out to be the biggest winners or losers from the new US president's trade policy.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "story": [
      "Three Ghanaians have told the BBC of their involvement in the fighting between Islamist insurgents and the military in neighbouring Burkina Faso, describing scenes of sometimes indiscriminate violence and bloody battles.",
      "\"We are always with the dead. In some battles, I've seen 40, 50 or 100 dead people,\" one of the men told the BBC.",
      "The three, all in their late thirties or early forties, said they had fought in Burkina Faso multiple times since 2018. They crossed the porous 550km-long (340-mile) border between the two countries, without being detected by the security forces.",
      "They denied being primarily motivated by religion or being trained by the jihadists, saying they went to fight to defend civilian communities with whom they had strong family and ethnic ties.",
      "\"My elder brother, his wife and children were all killed by the [Burkinabe] army. It pains me a lot. The military came to their community in the forest. They killed all of them, a whole household, including 29 people,\" one of the men said.",
      "But another of the men did articulate religious zeal, saying: \"If you die while fighting with the jihadists, then you are driving to jannah (an Islamic word for paradise), on the path of the righteous.\"",
      "Challenged over whether they had taken part in civilian attacks, the men were divided.",
      "One denied doing so, but another conceded that he did.",
      "\"Some local people support the military in attacking us, that's why we have to kill them too,\" he said.",
      "\"You know... I'm not happy to fight like this. The number of people we kill, the people the military kill, it's very bad. But this fight has entered our blood,\" he added.",
      "All three spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The BBC was unable to confirm their claims but they showed us pictures of weapons, described the location of recent conflicts and named jihadist commanders in Burkina Faso.",
      "The BBC was put in touch with the men through contacts at cattle markets in northern Ghana, where jihadist groups are alleged to be recruiting fighters.",
      "In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.",
      "And the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank, in a report released last July, said the jihadists  had \"minimal success\" recruiting in Ghana.",
      "However, the men offered a different perspective, telling the BBC, in claims that could not be verified, that people from \"all parts of Ghana\" and from \"many\" ethnic groups were joining the insurgency in Burkina Faso.",
      "\"Some are fighting for jihad. Some are doing it for business,\" one of them said.",
      "The financial incentive comes in the form of the plentiful livestock that the jihadists steal from communities driven out of their villages.",
      "\"When we attack a community, we take their animals: sometimes 50, sometimes 100,\" the BBC was told by one of the men.",
      "The cattle are allegedly brought to northern Ghana, and sold at markets.",
      "The trafficking across the border was confirmed to the BBC by cattle dealers.",
      "It is thought to have become a major income stream for groups like Jama'at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate that is the most active jihadist group in Burkina Faso. It also operates in Niger and Mali.",
      "The West African region was described by the UN last year as the epicentre of global jihadist violence.",
      "Aid agencies say that over the last decade some two-million people have been displaced by the insurgency in Burkina Faso and tens of thousands killed.",
      "Ninpoa Nasuri is one of the thousands who have fled to Ghana to escape the violence.",
      "She told the BBC her husband was killed in front of her in 2024 during a raid on their village in eastern Burkina Faso by fighters from JNIM.",
      "\"They grabbed the men, and they beat them to death. My husband was a farmer. He had nothing to do with the government militia or the conflict,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Other refugees described similar acts of violence by the Burkinabe military.",
      "\"Some of the people they were killing were aged 80, aged 90. These people can't hold a gun, can't fight with anybody. They killed them for no reason,\" Saafiya Karim said.",
      "Ghana has so far remained largely untouched by the insurgency, although some attacks have taken place in neighbouring Togo and Ivory Coast.",
      "In a recent statement to Ghanaian journalist Mohammed Eliasu Tanko, a man calling himself a representative of JNIM said the group had no interest in launching attacks in Ghana.",
      "\"They (JNIM fighters) are not allowed to take any action against Ghana. This is a clear and certain statement. JNIM do not seek war against Ghana,\" the man, known as Ansari, said in the statement, which the BBC has seen.",
      "However an upsurge in communal violence in one part of northern Ghana has raised concerns that the jihadists are trying to exploit the conflict to their advantage.",
      "The town of Bawku is embroiled in a decades-long struggle between different ethnic groups for control of the local chieftaincy. More than 100 people are thought to have been killed in clashes since fighting intensified in last October.",
      "\"The evening in Bawku is always [one of] gunshots and fierce exchanges. People use AK47s, M16s, all kinds of automatic rifles,\" a resident told the BBC.",
      "JNIM smugglers are accused of selling weapons to both sides.",
      "\"We understand they are supplying weapons that they have taken from the military in Burkina Faso. They do this by relying on the trucks that travel up to Niger and back carrying onions. They hide the weapons inside those trucks,\" Tanko told the BBC.",
      "\"One intelligence officer confirmed to me this was the new way they are bringing firearms in. And the Ghanaian security are ill-equipped to be able to detect these vehicles coming through, putting Ghana in a very critical situation,\" he added.",
      "Ghana's Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "President John Mahama, who took office in January after winning December's presidential election, visited Bawku last month in an effort to promote peace between the rival groups. However,  gunfights continue to be reported.",
      "Ghana's governing party spokesman Sammy Gyamfi told the BBC that ending the violence in Bawku was the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "\"The violence is already spreading and if care is not taken it's likely that insurgents from the wider region can take advantage of this conflict,\" he said.",
      "The three men the BBC spoke to said they did not rule out the possibility of the insurgency spreading.",
      "\"This thing can go to any place, or to any country. It didn't exist in Togo but now the attacks are happening there. If they can go to Togo, they can get to Ghana. This thing is strong, it's powerful,\" one of them said.",
      "But another of the men took a cynical perspective, saying the insurgents in Burkina Faso were no longer waging an \"Islamic struggle\".",
      "\"They just kill the people, and steal their livestock. What is happening is not jihad and so I do not like it,\" he said.",

      "I meet him in a small bar on a street corner in the ex-mining town of Freiberg, Saxony \u2013 where he is playing darts.",
      "It's a cold, foggy night in February with just over two weeks to go until Germany's national election.",
      "Nick and his friend Dominic, who is 30, are backers or sympathetic to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland - a party that has been consistently polling second in Germany for more than a year and a half, as the far right here and elsewhere in Europe attracts an increasing number of young people, particularly men, into its orbit.",
      "One particular reason why Nick \u2013 and many other young German men \u2013 say they are afraid is the number of attacks in Germany involving suspects who were asylum seekers \u2013 most recently, the fatal stabbing of a toddler and a man in a park in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg. Immigration is now Nick and Dominic's main concern, although they don't oppose it in all forms.",
      "\"The people who integrate, who learn, who study here, do their work - I have no problems with them,\" says Dominic, though he is critical of anyone he sees as taking advantage of the asylum system.",
      "\"But these days such statements are seen as hostile,\" says Dominic. \"You're called a Nazi because of Germany's past.\"",
      "The AfD  - which has long been accused of anti-migrant rhetoric - is celebrating endorsements from tech billionaire, Elon Musk, who owns the social media site X. He has hosted a live discussion with party leader Alice Weidel on the platform and dialled into a party rally.",
      "Now, as Germany waits to see just how well the far right does in the upcoming election, the question is why so many young men in particular are being drawn to the far right and what the consequences could be for a country that's deeply conscious of its Nazi past.",
      "Young men swinging to the right",
      "Pew research in 2024 found that 26% of German men had positive views of the AfD compared to 11% of women, and the share of men holding this opinion has risen 10 points since 2022.",
      "In the elections for the European Parliament in 2024, according to German exit polls the number of under 24-year-olds, both male and female, who voted for the AfD in Germany rose to 16 per cent, up by 11 points from 2019.",
      "This comes at a time of rising general anxiety among young people according to a recent study by the German Institute for Generational Research.",
      "In a sample size of 1,000 Germans aged 16 to 25, anxiety levels were the highest amongst respondents who class themselves as far-right while they were the lowest amongst people who put themselves in the middle of the political spectrum.",
      "Women were more likely to be concerned for their rights and those of minority groups while men were found to be more worried about conservative values that are less based around rights.",
      "Dr R\u00fcdiger Maas, from the German think tank the Institute for Generational Research, says parties on the left often focus on themes such as feminism, equality and women's rights.",
      "\"Overall, men don't see themselves in these themes,\" he tells us. \"That is why they have a tendency to vote further right.\"",
      "Hard, populist right parties have also done well in countries such as France, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Italy.",
      "\"Sixty per cent of young men under 30 would consider voting for the far right in EU countries and this is much higher than the share among women,\" says Prof Abou-Chadi, in analysis drawn from a subset of the 2024 European Election Study.",
      "Message spreaders",
      "As well as gender, migration and economic issues, social media is playing a part. Platforms like TikTok allow political groups to bypass mainstream, traditional media, which the far right regard as hostile.",
      "It's clear that AfD \"dominates\" TikTok when compared to other German parties, says Mauritius Dorn from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). It has 539,000 followers on its parliamentary account, compared to 158,000 for the SPD who currently have the most seats in the German parliament.",
      "And it isn't just official accounts but a \"considerable number of unofficial fan accounts also help to disseminate the party's content\", says Mr Dorn.",
      "Through setting up 10 \"persona-based\" accounts with different user profiles, they found, \"those users who are more on the right-wing spectrum\u2026 see a lot of AfD content whereas users from the leftist spectrum see a more diverse set of political content.\"",
      "TikTok has said it doesn't \"differentiate\" between the right, left or centre of politics and works to stay at the \"forefront\" of tackling misinformation.",
      "Dorn observes that other parties recognised sites such as TikTok \"too late\", which means they're playing catch-up in establishing a strong footprint on the platform.",
      "We've met one AfD influencer, Celina Brychcy - a 25-year-old TikTokker who has more than 167,000 followers - 53% of whom are male, with 76% aged between 18 and 35.",
      "She mainly shares dance, trend and lifestyle videos, but also pro-AfD content.",
      "Ms Brychcy says she doesn't make money from promoting the AfD but does it because she believes in the cause and wants to \"get a message across\".",
      "Her political ideals include wanting the return of military service, more support for mothers who want or need to stay at home and stricter border controls.",
      "When I press her about whether her views amount to a rejection of multiculturalism she replied no, but believes people should \"integrate.\"",

      "A reaction against \"gender ideology\" is another issue identified by Tarik Abou-Chadi, a professor of European Politics at the University of Oxford, as feeding far-right support amongst the young - something that is echoed by the Institute for Generational Research.",
      "They asked first-time voters whether they found the LGBTQ+ trend \"\u00fcbertrieben\", which literally means \"exaggerated\" or over the top. The respondents who showed the highest level of agreement with that question were those who planned to support the AfD.",
      "When I challenge Ms Brychcy over whether that could be seen as retrograde, she replied that \"biologically speaking, we are men and women\" and thinks people should present accordingly.",
      "Ms Brychcy tells me she has lost a couple of friends because of her politics - and now mostly spends time with those of a similar outlook.",
      "She doesn't agree with those who view the AfD as a dangerous movement - rather one that would offer genuine, radical change.",
      "When I ask Ms Brychcy if she considers herself as far-right, she says that on certain issues - such as border control and crime, \"Definitely yes\".",
      "It's a striking reply, particularly as often, the label of far-right is rejected by supporters of the AfD, including by the party leader, Alice Weidel, who insists she heads a conservative, libertarian movement.",
      "With the horrors of the Nazis further and further in the past, this is a generation that's grown up with parties like the AfD - whether that's on TV talk shows or in parliament after the AfD got its first MPs in 2017.",
      "Prof Abou-Chadi believes that the far right, generally, has become more normalised to the point, \"They don't seem so extreme any more.\"",
      "That's despite party scandals such as a talisman of the AfD's hard right, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, being fined twice last year for using a Nazi slogan, though he denied doing so knowingly.",
      "The AfD, in three German states, is classified as right-wing extremist by authorities - including in Saxony, a designation the party unsuccessfully challenged in court.",
      "It's a state where the number of \"right-wing extremist individuals\" had reached a \"new high\" - according to a report released last year by Saxony's domestic intelligence service - that showed data back to 2015.",

      "In a shopping mall in the city of Chemnitz in Saxony, we meet a group of young men who \u2013 while they won't go on the record \u2013 tell us they're right wing.",
      "Dressed in black, with uniformly short hair, they express beliefs that homosexuality is wrong and fear that the German \"race\" is under threat because of the growing migrant community.",
      "They question narratives about their country's past, seemingly a reference to the Nazi era.",
      "Diana Schwitalla has been teaching history and social studies for eight years. She says she has had to confront a case of Holocaust denial in the classroom and has heard other troubling remarks.",
      "\"We hear the Second World War was actually a good thing, and there was a reason people died then - and that this is good. Hitler is described as a good man,\" says Ms Schwitalla.",
      "She adds, \"Many students\u2026 very young students, {who} say it doesn't matter who I vote for, they'll do what they want 'up there' anyway. The question of who's 'up there', I don't get an answer to that.\"",
      "We met her over the course of two days - including at an adult vocational college in Freiberg that sits on the grounds of a former Nazi concentration camp. Jewish women, brought from Auschwitz, were used for slave labour here to make parts for aeroplanes.",
      "We did hear some talk of opposition to the levels of immigration into Germany plus a desire for national pride.",
      "The first day we met Ms Schwitalla, she is helping to organise a mock election for the students as a way of engaging them about democracy at another college site in the town of Fl\u00f6ha \u2013 about 15 miles away from Freiberg.",
      "We spoke to Cora, Melina and Joey, all 18.",
      "Cora says she has heard men of her age express a desire for women to be in the home harking back to a time \"when women took care of the children and when the husband comes home from work, the food is cooked\".

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",
      "The NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.",

      "Taylor Swift watches from the sidelines",
      "Before the show, it had been rumoured that Taylor Swift might swoop down from her VIP suite to join Lamar on stage.",
      "The pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015 - and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.",
      "In the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.",
      "Maybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team.",
      "Lady Gaga's surprise performance",
      "Before kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans' historic French Quarter.",
      "The star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.",
      "Gaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.",
      "\"Here on Bourbon Street, always the heart and soul of New Orleans, this year began with a terror attack that tried to shatter its spirit,\" said former American footballer Michael Strahan during the pre-filmed segment.",
      "\"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\"",
      "Musical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.",
      "Musician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.",
      "And just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano."

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift was back at the Super Bowl to watch Travis Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Her reception was a whole lot different than last year.",
      "The pop superstar, who was cheered loudly when she showed up at the big game in Las Vegas, was instead booed by the heavily pro-Eagles crowd when shown on the video boards inside the Superdome during a break in the first quarter.",
      "Sitting next to rapper Ice Spice, Swift gave a bit of a side-eye and wrinkled her nose when she realized the booing was directed at her.",
      "President Trump, who attended the game, suggested she was booed by his supporters. Swift\u00a0endorsed Joe Biden\u00a0in 2020 and\u00a0Kamala Harris in 2024. Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social site that, \"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\"",
      "Swift and Kelce have been a sports-and-entertainment power couple since early last season, when the four-time All-Pro tight end invited the now-14-time Grammy Award winner to watch him play in a matchup with the Bears. Kelce had famously tried to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she played at Arrowhead Stadium, only to be thwarted.",
      "Their relationship blossomed as the Chiefs pursued their second consecutive Super Bowl last year, and Swift was part of the on-field celebration on a cold night in Baltimore when the Chiefs beat the Ravens to win the AFC championship.",
      "Then came Swift's star turn at the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo the same weekend. Swift made a mad dash from there to the airport, hopped a private jet to Los Angeles, and made it to Las Vegas with time to spare. Once inside Allegiant Stadium, fans and TV cameras watched Swift win a beer-chugging contest, party with celebrity friends such as Blake Lively and Lana Del Rey, and eventually make her way to the field following the Chiefs' 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "Kelce and Swift celebrated by locking lips as red and gold confetti fell around them like rain.",
      "There was no closely watched trip around the globe this week, though.",
      "Swift arrived in the Big Easy in time to join Kelce on a double date with Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, on the players' night off Friday. The couples dined at Lilette, a French restaurant near the Garden District.",
      "On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant.",
      "The big question swirling Sunday was not whether Swift would make it to the game, like last year, but what could happen if she found herself on the field afterward, celebrating Kelce's third straight Super Bowl title and fourth overall. That didn't happen.",
      "The 35-year-old Kelce has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for his potential retirement. Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career, building a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other TV shows.",
      "Then there's the question of whether Kelce might pop the question. According to BetMGM, those willing to gamble on his plans could get 8/1 odds that Kelce would propose to Swift with a Chiefs victory.",
      "The Chiefs were 19-3 with her in the crowd, including 9-0 this season. She had never seen them lose in the playoffs.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 12:50:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Stephanie Courtney (Flo, the Progressive Insurance saleswoman), Dean Winters (Mayhem, of Allstate insurance commercials), and Deanna Colon (the unstoppable dancer in Jardiance diabetes drug ads) talk about their fame as pitch people.",
    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

    "title": "The New Yorker magazine's first hundred years",
    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 09:48:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Matthews, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Matthews. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

    "summary": "Pugilism has been a favored subject of artists and photographers since boxers first stepped into the ring. \"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\" an exhibit in West Palm Beach, Fla., captures this most combative of sports.",
    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",
      "... or Harry Benson's famous shot of a very young Muhammad Ali meeting the very young Beatles in a Miami gym on their first trip to the U.S., in 1964:",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:14:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Pertussis cases are on the rise again, after a dip following the winter holidays.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:48:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The National Institutes of Health says the cuts will save more than $4 billion a year, but critics say it puts potentially lifesaving research in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement. Collins said she called Kennedy \"to express my strong opposition to these arbitrary cuts in funding for vital research\" in the state.",
      "Cancer research, heart disease and more",
      "The vast majority of medical research in the U.S. is supported by NIH funding, which \"includes over 2,800 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions\" nationwide. Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",
      "The NIH justified the cutback as being similar to rates paid for these costs by other nonprofit foundations that subsidize medical research.",
      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "The former official said that artificially capping the rates below what they have negotiated with institutions ignores the work already done by health authorities to come up with current funding rates.",
      "\"Whoever wrote this memo knows nothing about how rates are calculated, what is included in them, what NIH is actually paying for. You cannot have medical research without buildings,\" they said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The adult patient infected with bird flu has reported only conjunctivitis and no other symptoms.",
    "story": [
      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",
      "Owen Truesdell, a spokesperson for the health district, said there is currently no evidence of other dairy workers showing symptoms.",
      "\"Please note that this is an evolving situation and we will continue to communicate with reporters and the public when relevant new information is learned,\" Truesdell said in an email.",
      "Health officials have said for months that while the spread of the virus in animals warrants stepping up precautions for workers dealing with sick cows and birds, the risk to the general public remains low.",
      "\"This case involving cow-to-human spread of H5 in a person with higher-risk occupational exposure does not change CDC's risk assessment, which remains low for the public but is higher for people with occupational or recreational exposures,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Virologists have said that multiple key mutations would need to change in the virus before it could easily spread between humans, beyond the occasional dead-end spillovers seen so far from animals into humans.",
      "An analysis published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday found that one \"mammalian adaptation\" had been found in the virus from the D1.1-infected cows in Nevada last month, but said there was \"no evidence of onward transmission among humans.\"",
      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",
      "Dr. Richard Webby, head of a World Health Organization influenza collaborating center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, said those tests were done using antibodies after infection.",
      "\"It is anticipated that vaccination will induce an even better response,\" said Webby in an email.",
      "Why aren't we vaccinating for bird flu?",
      "Under the Biden administration last year, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response moved to prepare enough vials to vaccinate 2.4 million people if needed \u2014 but so far those doses have not been distributed for use.",
      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",
      "But there have also been three cases over the past year with an \"unknown\" exposure, where investigators were unable to track down a likely explanation for how people got sick.",
      "More clues to one of those bird flu cold cases could come this month, when the CDC is expected to have results from a study looking at blood samples that might reveal missed infections among contacts of a child sickened in San Francisco.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 10:21:29 -0500",
    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",

The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",
      "Health officials and experts have long considered the MMWR as the \"voice of CDC\" and a respected source where federal scientists release research of public health importance. It ranks as among the most-cited health journals in the world.",
      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",

One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",

The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",

      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",

      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world.

Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "While standing next to President Trump in the Oval Office on Feb. 11, Musk defended DOGE's efforts to slash spending and dismiss workers across the federal government, insisting that Americans voted for major change and the Trump administration is delivering. Musk, the world's wealthiest person, added that it's \"essential\" the federal government pare spending.",
      "\"The people voted for major government reform and that's what the people are going to get,\" Musk said at the Oval Office. \"They're going to get what they voted for.\"",
      "Musk also added that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect,\" referencing a\u00a0false claim\u00a0that the U.S. was planning to send tens of millions of dollars worth of condoms to Gaza.",
      "\"We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we will fix the mistakes very quickly,\" Musk said.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Asked about his potential conflicts of interest during his White House appearance, Musk said the public can question whether he's benefiting from DOGE's actions.",
      "\"You can see whether I'm doing something that's benefitting one of my companies or not,\" Musk said. \"It's totally obvious.\"",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "DOGE's work so far has sparked multiple lawsuits, with groups including federal employee unions and government watchdogs suing over issues including data security. On Feb. 8, a federal judge in New York blocked the task force from accessing Treasury records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security for millions of Americans.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",
      "What is DOGE doing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?",
      "DOGE has gained access to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and has started a thorough review of the independent government agency designed to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. On Feb. 9, the Trump administration ordered the CFPB to halt much of its work.",
      "The task force has gained access to the internal systems, including personnel rolls and financial records of the agency, according to two sources directly familiar with their review. The CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way to help consumers with complaints about financial products such as credit cards.",
      "The CFPB has also created new rules for financial institutions and products to target a number of financial pitfalls that can hurt consumers. For instance, the agency has barred unpaid medical bills from appearing on credit reports, given that such bills can hurt a consumer's ability to get a mortgage or other type of loans.",
      "Musk posted \"RIP CFPB\" on his\u00a0X social media\u00a0platform on Friday, and the main website for the independent government agency is now down with a 404 message appearing when one clicks on it, although other reports and data remain accessible.",
      "DOGE's access to the CFPB has sparked two lawsuits\u00a0from a union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies. One lawsuit seeks to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another is aimed at stopping the task force from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",
      "In:\n          Elon Musk\nDonald Trump",

    "title": "Tesla has sued customers and journalists in China for defamation",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",
      "A month later, he apologized for his apology, saying the words were not his own.",

      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "Ad prices up, ticket prices down",
      "Contrary to rising ad prices, tickets to see the big game in person were slightly cheaper this year, a drop that\u00a0 StubHub spokesperson Adam Budelli partly attributes to the seating capacity Caesars Superdome's which at\u00a0roughly\u00a073,000 is larger than the 65,000 capacity at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, where the Super Bowl took place last year.",
      "\"What we've seen so far is our average ticket price sold is right around $7,100, and that's actually down around 17% YoY, when compared to the same time in Las Vegas,\" Budelli, told CBS MoneyWatch the Thursday before Super Bowl Sunday.",
      "Another contributing factor impacting ticket sales is travel. \"When you think about a ticket cost or price for an away Super Bowl, how much am I also spending for hotel, airfare, things like that, needs to come into play,\" he said.",
      "Budelli points to fatigue in the market as the third influencing factor, particularly from Chiefs fans. \"I mean this is their fifth out of sixth Super Bowl, so there's only so much money you're willing to spend once you've seen your team and even if you add in the Eagles, in the past 10 years they've also won a Super Bowl.\"",
      "That said, Budelli anticipated higher ticket prices closer to Sunday, something he said is common when it\u00a0 \"marquee, bucket list type of events\" like the Super Bowl. \"Look, there's less than 5,000 tickets available on StubHub; I can assure you there's a lot more buyers out there. At some point \u2014 and it's always hard to exactly predict when \u2014 as those buyers come on, prices increase.",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",
      "Super Bowl ads go back to the first Super Bowl in 1967. Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com. Ad prices for the most part have steadily increased since then, with the cost for a half-minute ad breaking $1 million in 1995 and reaching $5 million in 2017.",
      "What is the most expensive Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The most expensive Super Bowl commercial of all time is Amazon's \"Mind Reader\" ad, which aired during Super Bowl LVI in 2022. Featuring real-life couple Scarlett Johansson and comedian Colin Jost from \"SNL,\" the 90-second spot is reported to have cost $26 million to produce, according to experience management site Qualtrics.",
      "What is the cheapest Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The cheapest Super Bowl ad ever made appears to be a commercial by a startup company called LifeMinders.com that aired in 2000. The 30-second ad was made by three internal freelancers with a budget of less than $5,000, according to video marketing platform Wistia.",
      "Offering \"highly personalized emails on topics you ask for,\" the endearingly low-budget spot drew 700,000 people to its website in the week following the Super Bowl, according to AdAge. Sadly, it appears the company is no longer in business as the domain name is listed as\u00a0available.",

    "story": [
      "Almost $500 million in food aid is at risk of spoilage as it sits in ports, ships and warehouses after funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, was paused by the Trump administration, according to a Feb. 10 report from a government watchdog.",
      "The report from USAID's inspector general highlighted the risks of \"safeguarding and distribution\" of $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian aid after the Trump administration ordered almost all staff to be placed on leave and ordered a review of U.S. foreign assistance programs.",
      "USAID, which\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries, buys food directly from U.S. farmers and manufacturers, which have typically provided about 40% of international food assistance, according to a 2021 report from the Congressional Research Service. With USAID funding paused, there is concern among U.S. farmers about the market for some of their products, including Kansas sorghum producers, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.",
      "While the future of USAID's funding and its purchases from U.S. farmers remains unclear, there is currently $489 million worth of food sitting \"at ports, in transit, and in warehouses at risk of spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and diversion,\" the Feb. 10 USAID inspector general report said.",
      "An additional 500,000 additional metric tons of food is currently on ships or ready to be shipped abroad, the report added. USAID typically buys commodities such as wheat, soybeans, sorghum and split peas from U.S. farmers.",
      "\"When the food doesn't get to where it needs to go, it winds up in a landfill, and that has devastating effects,\" Ashley Stanley, the CEO of Spoonfuls, which redirects excess food from grocers and other companies to aid organizations in Massachusetts, told CBS Boston.",
      "The U.S. State Department, which has been tasked with overseeing USAID, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Musk has said the agency should be shut down, calling it \"beyond repair.\"",
      "The future of the agency, established in 1961 to combat poverty, strengthen democracy and protect human rights and global health, is now uncertain. On Friday, a federal judge prevented the Trump administration from placing 2,200 USAID employees on\u00a0administrative leave,",
      "The Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the largest humanitarian groups, called the U.S. cutoff the most devastating of any in its 79-year history. It said Monday that it will have to\u00a0suspend programs serving hundreds of thousands\u00a0of people in 20 countries.",

    "summary": "A new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleges that Starbucks is unlawfully relying on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",
      "Negative publicity over the incident, which was caught on video and widely shared over social media, embarrassed the company and led to its now abandoned open-door policy.",

Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\"Maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn't scalable or sustainable,\" Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\"",

In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",

Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",

We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",

      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" he said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with one seeking to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another aimed at stopping Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",
      "Over the weekend, Vought\u00a0ordered\u00a0the bureau's staff to halt almost all of their work, continuing the administration's ongoing blitz of the federal bureaucracy. Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",
      "\"CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have been directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any authorized type of leave,\" the NTEU said. \"It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to a purge of CFPB's workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency's statutory mission.\"",
      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

      "President Trump's firing of a member at the National Labor Relations Board leaves the federal agency unable to perform its duties protecting the rights of U.S. workers and monitoring union elections, according to labor experts.",
      "The agency is now down to two members, one below the minimum required to fully function, labor attorneys said, even as one of the country's largest companies, Amazon, presses the NLRB to void the results of a recent union election due to the board's downsizing.",
      "\"Right now the NLRB is not operational because there are only two out of five board members and the Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot operate with less than three members,\" Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab. and a former field attorney for the NLRB, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Wilcox is suing Mr. Trump, alleging the president exceeded his authority in firing her and requesting that she be reinstated as an NLRB member. Her firing runs counter to a \"Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies,\" according to the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The president's bid to oust her from her Senate-confirmed position is \"unlawful and unprecedented,\" Wilcox said in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0 \"When Congress established the National Labor Relations Board almost 90 years ago, it made sure that the law would protect its independence from political influence. My removal, without cause or process, directly violates that law.\"",
      "Appointed to the NLRB in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in September 2023 to serve another term through 2028, Wilcox was told in a letter that she had not performed \"in a matter consistent with the objectives\" of the president.",
      "The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Wilcox's firing seems \"an illegal termination,\" with no notice or hearing, Cornell's Creighton said, noting that federal law prohibits a president from getting rid of board members except in case of negligence or malfeasance.",
      "How it affects workers",
      "Some of the NLRB's day-to-day work can continue, but the board itself \"can't order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union,\" said Matthew Bodie, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"There are some people who are concerned that the Trump administration will take its time to fill those three positions, or not fill them at all, so it renders the agency toothless at some level.\"",
      "\"We've never had this particular situation where it's been rendered inoperative for lack of a quorum and what that means for workers,\" added John Logan, a labor historian and professor at San Francisco State University's Lam Family College of Business. \"Do they exist only if there's a bureaucratic framework to enforce them?\" he asked of the legal protections granted workers.",
      "Whole Foods union effort in jeopardy",
      "The NLRB's lack of a quorum is reason to overturn the results of a Jan. 27 election that had workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia\u00a0voting to unionize, the Amazon-owned grocery chain said in\u00a0objections\u00a0filed with the NLRB on Monday.",
      "Whole Foods has accused the local union of not playing by the rules.",

      "The filings by Whole Foods are in line with tactics employed by its corporate parent, the UFCW said.",
      "\"It's similar to what they filed in other Amazon cases around the country,\" UFCW Local 1776 President Wendell Young IV told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This company is going to take advantage of Trump cleaning house,\" Young said.",
      "Amazon and Whole Foods are delaying in hopes of getting a business-friendlier NLRB, or \"that ultimately the Supreme Court will have a different view than past courts,\" he added of lawsuits filed by Amazon and Elon Musk's SpaceX challenging the NLRB's structure as unconstitutional.",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles secured the championship in Sunday's Super Bowl 59, but there were also several winners \u2014 and plenty of losers \u2014 in the lineup of star-studded commercials that aired during the broadcast. The best Super Bowl LIX ads delivered strong messages, either through humor or drama, while the worst commercials left some viewers befuddled, experts said.",
      "There's a lot on the line for Super Bowl advertisers, with a few ad spots selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Last year, a 30-second spot\u00a0sold for about $7 million. Advertisers also spend additional millions on creating their ads, often hiring well-known actors or celebrities to appear in their spots.",
      "Super Bowl commercials that score can pay off for a company through new customers and a stronger brand image, but ads that fumble can tarnish a business's marketing message and even turn off consumers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who co-runs its annual Super Bowl ad ranking.",
      "The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\"That's the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn't the advertising you notice or remember.\"",
      "This year's crop of ads included some that dropped the ball, according to Northwestern marketing professor Derek Rucker, who co-runs the Kellogg ad review with Calkins.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Coffee Mate",
      "One of this year's worst ads was the spot from Coffee Mate, Kellogg's ad review found. That spot featured two men sitting on the couch when one of them puts Coffee Mate's cold foam on his drink. His tongue then leaps out of his mouth and dances along to music and fireworks.",
      "\"The brand showcased dancing tongues, which included jumping out of a person's mouth,\" Rucker told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The spot was distracting and the brand's message got lost as a result, he said.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Tubi",
      "Another commercial that was voted as one of this year's worst by the panel was the Tubi ad, Rucker said. That spot, for the Tubi streaming service, featured people with fleshy hat-like appendages, with the main character born with a cowboy-shaped head. The ad was \"good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,\" according to Collider.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: ChatGPT",
      "ChatGPT's ad was also a low-rated ad, according to Northwestern's ad panel. Its spot showed the evolution of human tech through black-and-white pixelated images, but the business school gave it poor marks because it didn't show viewers anything new. The ad cost $14 million to air in the first half, according to tech publication The Verge.",
      "\"It's understandable given that, with the amount of money invested in the spot, the audience really was given very little new information about ChatGPT. It's almost as if it simply showed up the party not knowing what to do,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Michelob Ultra",
      "This spot features actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara as they hustle younger players out of their Michelob Ultra beers by wagering that they can beat them at pickleball. \"Play you for an Ultra?\" O'Hara asks at the end of the commercial.",
      "\"Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara appeared together and showcased their hustle\u2014 and hustling\u2014 for Michelob Ultra. It's got just the right balance between brand and celebrity, and it resonated with our panel,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Google",
      "The Google ad featured a dad preparing for a job interview, who turns to Google's Gemini AI app to help him craft a description of the most challenging job he's had \u2014 being a dad.",
      "\"Google once again impressed our panel with a spot that showcased both the functionality of its phone and added its own emotional twist,\" Rucker said.",

    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

It's the Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl LI \u2026 the Red Sox against the Yankees \u2026 the Heat against the Spurs \u2026 and every damn sports movie ever made. The scoreboard makes for a grim canvas. Time is winding down. All looks lost. But one team refuses to concede.",

There are assorted obituaries. Some staffers would even leave their pride on the sidelines and go on television pleading for a miracle.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 18:36:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Highway Administration directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure\u200b \u2014 funds that were allocated under former President Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration, in a letter Thursday, directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure \u2014 funds that had been allocated under former President Joe Biden. President Trump has slammed federal funding for electric vehicle chargers as \"an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "But the administration may need an act of Congress to freeze the states' spending, and it's not clear there will be one. Industry leaders say customer demand will continue to drive growth in the charging network, regardless of federal funding.",
      "The Tesla Supercharger network \u2014 led by CEO Elon Musk, now leading Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has received millions of dollars through the program that was just halted. But it also has a massive footprint of chargers across the country. Tesla will continue expanding its network regardless of federal money and is likely to benefit from its competitors receiving fewer funds.",
      "Trump and EV charging",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump paused billions in funding for a nationwide buildout of fast electric car chargers that had been allocated to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program.",
      "Then the Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers NEVI funding, told states Thursday to stop carrying out their plans, pending new guidelines. It's part of the broader effort to dismantle many environmental policies and incentives put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Some states, like Alabama and Rhode Island, had already suspended their programs in response to the Inauguration Day order, but Thursday's directive is a further push from the Trump administration to halt federal efforts to electrify the roads and reduce planet-warming emissions from transportation.",
      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",
      "Impact on EV drivers in the U.S.",
      "NEVI was created through the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed by Congress in 2021, to fill gaps in the EV charging infrastructure network. It addresses the concern many car buyers have for road trips where charging stations are too far apart.",
      "The NEVI program awards states $5 billion over five years, but they've struggled with permitting delays, complicated electrical upgrades and contracting.",
      "Estimates suggest $3.3 billion of NEVI funding had already gone out the door to states.",
      "Uncertainty for charging stations along highways",
      "This announcement creates uncertainty, said Ryan Gallentine, managing director at business association Advanced Energy United.",
      "\"Most of the unawarded money is sitting in state Department of Transportation bank accounts ready to be spent,\" Gallentine said in a statement. States are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement, he said. \"We call on state DOTs and program administrators to continue executing this program until new guidance is finalized.\"",
      "Others say the effort is sure to trigger legal battles.",
      "The administration has \"no legal basis\" for stopping plans that have already been approved and funded, said Andrew Wishnia, former deputy assistant secretary for climate policy at the DOT who helped author the NEVI program.",
      "Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, a company that tracks EV charging data, predicted EV range concerns will linger for drivers. \"If you don't have convenient access either where you live or where you work or in between, why would you get an EV? It just doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "Money that was leftover after states met their highway obligations was meant to fill other gaps in charging: areas where there are low rates of EVs, including low-income areas or areas with a lot of apartment buildings where it hard for people to charge.",
      "The road ahead for U.S. highway EV charging",
      "The federal buildout is not the only effort to build EV charging across the nation. Private companies have collectively spent billions on this infrastructure.",
      "EV industry executives say that the demand from drivers for EV chargers will propel companies to build more of them. \"I think the trend will continue. Maybe it'll slow down over the next four years \u2026 but it's going to continue,\" said Bassem Ammouri, the chief operating officer at EV Connect, a major EV charging platform.",
      "But some fear that delaying critical charging infrastructure could have a domino effect on the EV transition, because it could slow sales, said Matt Stephens-Rich, director of programs at the non-partisan group Electrification Coalition.",
      "\"As the world is shifting to electric vehicles, any slowdown will put the U.S. auto industry further behind,\" Stephens-Rich said.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the development in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House.",
      "\"[Nippon's] going to be doing something very exciting about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,\" he said. \"U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good. So they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting.\"",
      "The president did not reveal details of the proposed investment, and said he and other officials will meet next week with the head of Nippon, which Mr. Trump mistakenly referred to as \"Nissan\" several times. \"They'll work out the details. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate,\" he said.",
      "People close to the deal were uncertain about whether Mr. Trump wants them to restructure the deal or start again from scratch. And it remains unclear how the president's remarks might affect the proposed acquisition.",
      "Earlier in the day, sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump was considering reversing his disapproval of the merger, which he expressed in a December post on Truth Social: \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.\"",
      "During his Oval Office meeting with Ishiba on Friday, CBS News asked the president whether he had changed his mind about the sale. He hinted that he would have news to share afterward and said he thought it would be discussed, saying he hadn't changed his mind. However, he added, \"I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that.\"",
      "Last month, Nippon proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS. That change was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "On Monday, Nippon and U.S. Steel submitted a 70-page opening brief in their case against the U.S. alleging that former President Joe Biden blocked the merger for political reasons and violated their due process. The suit has continued during the Trump administration.",
      "The two companies said in a joint statement announcing the lawsuit last month that they had \"engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\"",
      "A second lawsuit aimed at domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers President David McCall was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the companies stated.",
      "Biden moved to halt the acquisition after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it, saying that maintaining a strong domestic steel industry was important for U.S. national security.",

      "Messaging from the U.S. renewable energy industry and the United Nations on climate change has typically focused on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of environmental and human health. To bolster the argument, they cite record-shattering heat around the world, the frequent climate disasters costing billions of dollars and the human toll of it all.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate is voting Wednesday on Tulsi Gabbard's confirmation for director of national intelligence, after her nomination survived a crucial committee vote last week and cleared a key procedural hurdle Monday.",
      "Gabbard, 43, is a former Democratic congresswoman who represented Hawaii in the House from 2013 to 2021, and sought the party's nomination for president in the 2020 election. In 2022, she opted to leave the party, and she endorsed President Trump's 2024 White House bid.",
      "Gabbard was previously seen as one of the most unlikely of Mr. Trump's picks to get through the Senate. Though she served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, Gabbard doesn't have a background in intelligence. And she faced scrutiny for meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, as well as her comments about Russia's war in Ukraine, her previous opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority and a push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.",
      "During her hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee last month, Gabbard was grilled by both Democrats and Republicans on many of the actions and positions that have sparked controversy, with the most contentious moments of the hearing surrounding whether she would characterize Snowden as a \"traitor.\" Gabbard declined to say so.",
      "But as the committee prepared to hold a vote on whether to advance Gabbard's nomination last week, possible GOP opposition fell by the wayside. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Todd Young of Indiana both pledged to back Gabbard, and her nomination eked through with a 9-8 vote along party lines to recommend her confirmation.",
      "The full Senate went on to advance Gabbard's nomination 52-46 in a party-line procedural vote Monday night, though Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania did not vote. The vote started the clock on up to 30 hours of debate before a vote on final passage, setting up a vote on final passage in the wee hours of the morning Wednesday that was pushed back until later Wednesday amid snowy conditions in Washington.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised Gabbard ahead of the procedural vote Monday, calling her \"a patriot\" who is \"motivated by service.\"",
      "\"The intelligence community needs to refocus on its core mission \u2014 collecting intelligence and providing unbiased analysis of that information,\" Thune said. \"That's what Tulsi Gabbard is committed to ensuring if she is confirmed to be DNI. And I believe she has the knowledge and leadership capabilities to get it done.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer lambasted Republicans for backing Gabbard, claiming they're doing so because Mr. Trump is \"strong-arming them into submission.\"",
      "\"By now, there is no question about whether or not Miss Gabbard is qualified to lead America's intelligence agencies,\" Schumer said. \"By every objective measure she is not.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing, Gabbard defended her qualifications, citing her experience as a battalion commander and service on the Homeland Security, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees in Congress. That experience, she said, has \"given me a deep understanding of the complex challenges that our nation faces.\"",
      "\"In both roles engaging with world leaders, in both roles being privy to highly classified intelligence,\" Gabbard said. \"So I know first hand how essential accurate, unbiased and timely intelligence is to the president, to Congress and to our warfighters. I also know the heavy cost of intelligence failures and abuses.\"",
      "Gabbard argued that \"for too long, faulty, inadequate or weaponized intelligence have led to costly failures, and the undermining of our national security and god-given freedoms enshrined in the Constitution,\" adding that Mr. Trump's victory in the 2024 election is \"a clear mandate from the American people to break this cycle of failure.\"",
      "\"If confirmed as DNI, I will do my very best to fulfill this mandate, and bring leadership to the intelligence community with a laser-like focus on our essential mission \u2014 ensuring the safety, security and freedom of the American people,\" Gabbard said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of eight former internal government watchdogs who were fired by President Trump filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging their terminations.",
      "The legal challenge, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C, argues that their firings violate federal laws meant to protect inspectors general from interference with their oversight duties. One of those laws, passed in 2022 with bipartisan support in both chambers, requires a president to give Congress 30 days notice before removing an inspector general and provide the \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons\" for the termination.",
      "The former inspectors general involved in the lawsuit worked at the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, State, Education, Agriculture and Labor, as well as the Small Business Administration. The lawsuit names the president and the heads of those departments and agencies as defendants.",
      "Inspectors general are nonpartisan and are tasked with conducting audits and investigations of the agencies they oversee to protect against waste, fraud and abuse. They have typically been appointed regardless of political affiliation and must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"President Trump's attempt to eliminate a crucial and longstanding source of impartial, non-partisan oversight of his administration is contrary to the rule of law,\" they said in the 32-page lawsuit, which called the firings \"unlawful and unjustified.\"",
      "The watchdogs said that the agencies revoked access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and collected their equipment, such as government-issued phones and computers and access badges. The officials said they were also \"physically disabled\" from entering the government buildings where they work. Agency employees also arranged for the inspectors general to collect their personal belongings from their offices, the lawsuit states.",
      "\"These actions have had their intended effect of making it impossible for the IGs to perform their lawful duties,\" the lawsuit states. \"Because the purported removals were illegal and hence a nullity, the actions just described constituted illegal interference with the IGs' official duties.\"",
      "The watchdogs are asking the court to declare that their removals are void, which would mean that they are still duly appointed inspectors general of their respective agencies until the president removes them in compliance with federal law.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the internal government watchdogs on Jan. 24, four days into his second term. They were notified in a two-line email from the Office of Presidential Personnel stating that \"due to changing priorities your position as inspector general ... is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "The president told reporters late last month that the firings were \"standard\" and a \"very common thing to do.\"",
      "But the inspectors general argued in their lawsuit that Mr. Trump's claims are wrong, as presidents of both parties \u2014 including the president during his first term \u2014 refrained from removing the internal watchdogs that were in place by their predecessors.",
      "They also said that Mr. Trump has not communicated to Congress his intention to remove the inspectors general or provided a \"substantive rationale,\" as required by law.",
      "\"IGs must be watchdogs, not lapdogs,\" the lawsuit states. \"The deleterious consequences of the Trump administration's contrary approach are hard to overstate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to terminate the officials set off alarm bells in Congress. In the wake of his action, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and ranking member Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, sent the president a letter asking him to provide the legally required 30-day notice and reasons for their removal.",
      "Grassley sponsored the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, which laid out the requirements for getting rid of an inspector general.",
      "\"While IGs aren't immune from committing acts requiring their removal and they can be removed by the president, the law must be followed,\" Grassley and Durbin wrote.",
      "They added: \"This is a matter of public and congressional accountability and ensuring the public's confidence in the Inspector General community, a sentiment shared more broadly by other members of Congress. IGs are critical to rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct within the Executive Branch bureaucracy, which you have publicly made clear you are also intent on doing.\"",
      "The lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's removal of the watchdogs is one of more than four dozen that have been filed in courts from coast to coast against the administration. Several of those legal battles target the president's firing of government officials, including the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Office of Special Counsel, which investigates retaliation against whistleblowers and violations of the Hatch Act, as well as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans released a budget resolution on Wednesday, laying a foundation for advancing President Trump's agenda on border security, defense, energy and tax priorities, despite momentum around a competing proposal in the Senate.",
      "The budget proposal says that the House Ways and Means Committee can pursue up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, and sets a goal of cutting mandatory spending by $2 trillion. It would also increase the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "The long-awaited budget resolution comes as congressional leaders have been pursuing a massive legislative package under the budget reconciliation process that would enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend some of the 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to trim government programs and address the debt limit.",
      "In the House, the process has faced delays amid intraparty disagreement on how to proceed. And the stalled progress in the lower chamber has prompted the Senate to move ahead with its own proposal in recent days, with a markup taking place Wednesday and Thursday.",
      "The House Budget Committee is also set to begin marking up its newly released budget resolution on Thursday, as House Republicans look to keep pace with the competing Senate proposal.",
      "While House Republicans are pursuing one reconciliation package, Senate Republicans have advocated for a two-package approach, splitting border security, defense and energy from the tax components. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, is leading the charge in the upper chamber and outlined to reporters Tuesday that while he supports the House's effort to approve a single package, lawmakers can't wait to iron out the complicated tax details.",
      "\"I wish you the best, I want one big beautiful bill,\" Graham said to his House colleagues. \"But I cannot and will not go back to South Carolina and justify not supporting the president's immigration plan.

    "summary": "While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals and suspected gang members to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrant detainees who lack serious criminal records or any at all, according to two U.S. officials and internal government documents.",
      "When he ordered officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into a large-scale immigration detention site late last month, President Trump said it would house the \"worst\" migrants and \"provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "Administration officials have since touted military flights to Guantanamo that they said have transported migrants in the U.S. illegally who have also committed violent crimes like murder and rape, as well as alleged members of Tren de Aragua, the infamous gang that originated in Venezuelan prisons.",
      "Internal documents and interviews with U.S. officials indicate the administration has sent migrant criminals and alleged gang members to Guantanamo, detaining them in the post-9/11 maximum-security prison that also houses, in a separate section, more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "But in addition to sending those with criminal records or suspected or known gang ties \u2014 classified as \"high-risk\" detainees \u2014 U.S. officials have also transported migrants deemed to be \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, according to the government documents obtained by CBS News. More low-risk migrants are expected to be transported on Wednesday, alongside high-risk detainees, the documents show.",
      "Federal immigration authorities define low-risk detainees as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who have not been arrested or convicted of violent offenses or other serious crimes, government guidelines show. U.S. officials said they could include migrants who lack any criminal record but have been ordered deported because of civil immigration violations, like entering the country without proper documents.",
      "While the high-risk migrants have been detained in cells at Guantanamo's maximum-security prison, the low-risk detainees have been placed in a barrack-like facility known as the Migrant Operations Center that includes rooms with restrooms, according to the documents and one of the U.S. officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "The State Department has traditionally used the Migrant Operations Center to house asylum-seekers intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard, while they wait to be resettled in third countries.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. The department oversees the ICE officials who have legal custody over the migrant detainees at Guantanamo.",
      "In two weeks, officials have made some progress in operationalizing Mr. Trump's instructions to establish the facilities needed to detain as many as 30,000 unauthorized migrants at the base in Guantanamo, a 45-square mile stretch of Cuban land that the U.S. has leased for over a century.",
      "Over the past week, U.S. service members at the base have been erecting tents to house migrant detainees beyond the prison and Migrant Operations Center, both of which have limited capacities.",
      "Officials have also been meeting the administration's goal of transporting groups of detainees to the base daily, sending six consecutive military flights over the past six days. The flights, however, have only carried up to 15 detainees each, due to limits on how many can be transported at one time once they reach the base.",
      "As of late Tuesday, nearly 100 unauthorized migrants were being held at Guantanamo, all of them adults from Venezuela, one of the U.S. officials said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said recently the detainees will be held there until they can be deported, but it's unclear when that could happen.",
      "In recent years, Venezuela's repressive government has generally rejected American deportation flights, citing the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. Under a recently brokered agreement with the Trump administration, Venezuela sent two planes to the Texas border earlier this week to pick nearly 200 of its citizens who were in U.S. immigration custody and transport them back to Venezuela. But similar flights to Guantanamo have not been announced.",
      "While some Republican lawmakers have praised the Trump administration for using Guantanamo to hold migrant detainees, the effort has alarmed pro-immigrant civil rights groups. They have accused the administration of using the naval base as a \"legal black hole\" to hold migrants \"incommunicado,\" demanding that the detainees be given access to lawyers.",
      "While the transportation of low-risk migrants to Guantanamo undermines statements from Trump officials that the facility would be used to house \"the worst of the worst,\" it also reinforces a message the administration has communicated repeatedly: no one who is in the U.S. illegally will be shielded from detention and deportation, even if they lack criminal histories.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:39:17 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" new CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

      "His family had pushed for Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, to secure his release, particularly after Fogel was left out of prisoner swaps negotiated by the previous administration. In December 2022, Russia released WNBA star Brittney Griner in a one-for-one prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Then, last August, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans from Russia \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva\u00a0\u2014 as part of a 24-person prisoner exchange.",

This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, Fogel's legal team, also praised the president and his administration for their work in freeing him.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership,\" they said. \"After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.\"",
      "Pennsylvania's senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, cheered Fogel's release.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Fetterman, a Democrat,\u00a0wrote on X.",

      "Asked about any personal conflicts he has and whether he's policing himself, Musk did not answer directly but said the DOGE website is explaining what it's doing, an apparent reference to the group's account on X, which details contracts that federal agencies have canceled. Pressed a second time, Musk said the public can question whether he's benefiting from DOGE's actions.",
      "\"You can see whether I'm doing something that's benefitting one of my companies or not,\" Musk said. \"It's totally obvious.\"",
      "Musk, whose web of companies have billions of dollars worth of contracts with the federal government, said he doesn't think he'll be able to get away with anything untoward.",

      "The president said if he thought Musk had a conflict of interest with some project, he wouldn't let Musk proceed.",
      "Mr. Trump was asked if he plans to abide by the courts' decisions limiting his administration's actions. Vice President JD Vance and other Trump allies have said the court's had no role in constraining the executive branch's legitimate authority, raising fears among Democrats that Mr. Trump could defy a court order and spark a constitutional crisis.",
      "\"Well, I always abide by the courts, and then I have to appeal it,\" the president said, while questioning why a judge would want to block his agenda.",
      "Musk recognized there could be errors, and acknowledged that \"some of the things that I say will be incorrect,\" referencing a false claim that the U.S. was planning to send tens of millions of dollars worth of condoms to Gaza.",
      "\"We are moving fast, so we will make mistakes, but we will fix the mistakes very quickly,\" Musk said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump fired the inspector general for the United States Agency for International Development on Tuesday, one day after he released a report detailing the impact of the administration's cuts to the agency, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Paul Martin, the ousted inspector general, was given no reason for his dismissal in a two-sentence email from Trent Morse, deputy director of the White House's Office of Presidential Personnel. Martin was appointed by former President Joe Biden and led the inspector general's office since December 2023. News of his firing was first reported by CNN.",
      "His dismissal came a day after his office released a report on the impact of the White House's effort to shut down USAID. The report said that the reductions across the agency have \"degraded USAID's ability to distribute and safeguard taxpayer-funded humanitarian assistance.\" Investigators found that nearly $500 million in food aid was at risk of spoiling as it sat in ports, ships and warehouses after the funding cuts.",
      "No one else at the USAID inspector general's office has been put on leave, though employees were told on Tuesday they no longer have access to their office in the Ronald Reagan building. USAID's lease in the building was terminated over the weekend, according to the General Services Administration.",
      "In an email to colleagues, Martin wrote that he was notified his termination is effective immediately, and that the assistant inspector general for investigations will become acting inspector general.",
      "\"It has been a true honor and pleasure to walk alongside my OIG colleagues around the world as we sought to provide independent and aggressive oversight of USAID programs and personnel. And while I had hoped to walk with all of you a bit longer on this journey, that will not be possible,\" Martin wrote in the email.",
      "Shortly after his inauguration, Mr. Trump fired at least 17 other inspectors general, without providing a reason. Democrats and even some Republicans in Congress, like Sen. Chuck Grassley, have demanded that the administration provide a rationale, arguing that federal law requires a justification.",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 PBS says it is shutting down its office of diversity, equity and inclusion to comply with President Trump's executive order\u00a0and firing the two executives brought on when the effort was begun in 2021.",
      "The move, eliminating the jobs held by Cecilia Loving and her associate Gina Leow, comes as public television and radio gird for a fight over federal funding likely to be more serious than they've faced in many years.",
      "Despite eliminating the DEI effort, PBS CEO Paula Kerger said Tuesday that \"we were committed to telling the stories of all Americans before we had an office, and will continue to do it afterwards.\"",
      "Because PBS gets federal funding through U.S. Department of Education and National Science Foundation for its children's programming, the system's lawyers determined that it needed to comply with Mr. Trump's order, she said. The system gets some $535 million in general support from the government, about 16% of its budget, but because it's filtered through the private Corporation for Public Broadcasting, it's unclear whether that would require compliance.",
      "Some of PBS' 330 member stations have their own DEI efforts and receive CPB funding, so it will be up to them to decide what to do with their offices. \"We're trying to encourage them to have lawyers look at their circumstances,\" Kerger told The Associated Press.",
      "The Free Press website reported that PBS initially considered transferring Loving and Leow to other jobs within the system. Kerger said that was thought about but rejected.",
      "The DEI office was concerned with more than just racial equity; much of its recent work went to making sure children with hearing issues had access to PBS programming, she said.",
      "Four years ago, PBS faced pressure from the opposite direction. More than 130 filmmakers sent a letter to the system saying that its relationship with documentarian Ken Burns came at the expense of others and that PBS showed a \"systemic failure to fulfill a mandate for a diversity of voices.\"",
      "With the Trump administration's current efforts at cutting federal spending, Kerger understands public broadcasting will be looked at closely. Republican Sen. Mike Lee, of Utah, posted \"let's defund PBS and NPR\" on X Tuesday.",
      "That's not a new opinion. Republicans in the past have made similar calls, primarily because of a contention that news programming leans left. Ultimately, efforts to defund PBS usually fall short through pressure brought to bear on individual legislators from the hundreds of stations across the country.",
      "Kerger and NPR officials are expected to testify next month before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.",
      "\"I think it is different this time because so much is under scrutiny,\" Kerger said. \"I never assume that government funding will continue. I think we have to work hard each and every time these questions come up to make sure we are making the case of why this is important.\"",
      "She said it's a time where people assume \"there is bias at play\" when they don't see their opinions expressed in news stories. Some people feel news efforts are too conservative, others too liberal. \"We take that part of our work pretty seriously and if we miss sometime, we correct that,\" she said.",
      "Work done by local stations to alert citizens during the California wildfires and hurricanes in Florida are examples of things legislators need to be aware of, she said.",
      "\"I'm always an optimistic person,\" Kerger said, \"but I think it's going to require a lot of conversations to see if we can hold on to a level of funding to enable our stations to continue.\"",

    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident.

      "The Associated Press pushed back against the Trump administration on Tuesday after one of its reporters was blocked from an event over the news organization's guidance on its continued use of the \"Gulf of Mexico\" in its coverage, calling the move a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "The White House demanded early Tuesday that the AP alter its style guidance to use the name Gulf of America versus using the Gulf of Mexico, AP\u00a0executive editor Julie Pace\u00a0said in a statement. President Trump renamed the body of water to the Gulf of America through an executive order last month. Later on Tuesday, Pace said the White House stopped an AP reporter from attending Mr. Trump's executive order signing in the Oval Office.",
      "\"It is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism. Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP's speech not only severely impedes the public's access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment,\" Pace said.",
      "The AP's style guide, which many newsrooms across the country follow, published on Jan. 23, two days after the president signed his executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico, states that Mr. Trump's order only carries authority within the United States and other countries do not have to recognize the change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday and renewed his suggestions that Gaza could be emptied of residents, controlled by the U.S. and redeveloped as a tourist area \u2014 a plan that would likely only work if the Arab nation agrees to accept more Palestinian refugees.",
      "The pair met in the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump suggested he would not withhold U.S. aid to Jordan, Egypt or other Arab nations if they don't agree to dramatically increase the number of people they take in from Gaza.",
      "\"I don't have to threaten that. I do believe we're above that,\" Mr. Trump said. That contradicted his previous suggestion that holding back aid was a possibility.",
      "Abdullah was asked repeatedly about Mr. Trump's audacious plan to remake the Middle East, but didn't make substantive comments in the Oval Office on it, nor the idea that his country could accept large numbers of new refugees from Gaza. He did say that Jordan would accept roughly 2,000 children with cancer and other health problems \"right away.\" Mr. Trump said he did not know about that commitment, which he called \"a beautiful gesture.\"",
      "After their meeting, however, in a series of social media posts, King Abdullah \"reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\"",
      "\"This is the unified Arab position,\" he said. \"Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all. Achieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability. This requires US leadership. President Trump is a man of peace. He was instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire. We look to US and all stakeholders in ensuring it holds.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also repeated suggestions, during their meeting, that the U.S. could come to control Gaza, but that it wouldn't require committing American funds. Asked under what authority he could take control of the territory, he said: \"under the U.S. authority,\" without elaborating.",
      "\"We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it,\" Mr. Trump said of Gaza. He suggested the redeveloped area could have new hotels, office buildings and houses and, \"and we'll make it exciting.\"",
      "\"I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it,\" said Mr. Trump, who built a New York real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, while also insisting that he personally would not be involved in the development.",
      "Mr. Trump also renewed his suggestion during his meeting with Abdullah that the tenuous ceasefire between Hamas and Israel could be ended if Hamas doesn't release all the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday \u2014 a deadline that's not in line with the ceasefire terms agreed to by the parties.",
      "\"I don't think they're going to make the deadline, personally,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas. \"They want to play tough guy. We'll see how tough they are.\"",
      "The king's visit came at a perilous moment for the Gaza ceasefire. Hamas accused Israel this week of violating the truce and said it was delaying further hostage releases under the agreement.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East,\" with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations, with no right of return.",
      "His Tuesday comments contradicted his Monday suggestions that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt \u2014 longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid \u2014 as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Mr. Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country's opposition to Mr. Trump's idea was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Besides concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.",
      "The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The president announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He initially didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.",
      "After Mr. Trump's initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza \"temporarily\" and sought an \"interim\" period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction.",

      "As acting director, Rowe testified multiple times before lawmakers, addressing questions about the security failures that allowed the gunman in Butler, Thomas Matthew Crooks, to gain access to a rooftop so close to where President Trump was speaking. His most recent appearance before the bipartisan task force investigating the assassination attempt, last December, devolved into a shouting match when Republican Rep. Pat Fallon accused him of \"playing politics\" when he attended a 9/11 memorial event with the nation's top leaders.",
      "Rowe first joined the agency in 1999, serving in Secret Service field offices in West Palm Beach and Miami before joining the Presidential Protective Division, and later, the agency's Congressional Affairs Program. He has also served as chief of staff and assistant director for the Office of Intergovernmental and Legislative Affairs.",

      "\"It is unacceptable for a nominee with no current role in government, much less at the FBI, to personally direct unjustified and potentially illegal adverse employment actions against senior career FBI leadership and other dedicated, nonpartisan law enforcement officers,\" Durbin wrote.",
      "Durbin told the Justice Department IG that he had heard from his sources that Patel's directives were being carried out by top White House aide Stephen Miller, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove and members of the new FBI Director's Advisory Team. A member of the team, Durbin said his sources told him, has been providing Patel with information about what's going on inside the bureau, and that Patel \"then provides direction to Mr. Miller, who relays it to Acting Deputy Attorney General Bove.\" He claimed that each person on the DAT team communicated to bureau officials that \"at some point before January 30 that they had been in direct contact with Mr. Patel.\"",
      "DAT, Durbin said, had a list that \"identified certain officials and was seen by multiple FBI leaders.\" Those on the list were understood to be \"people in the crosshairs.\" On Jan. 29, Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll and Acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane held a meeting \"where it was relayed that a group of Executive Assistant Directors (EAD) and other supervisors must resign or be fired,\" Durbin wrote.",

    "summary": "Speaker Mike Johnson said House GOP expects to move forward on budget plan this week that lays foundation for approving Trump's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that House Republicans expect to move forward on a budget plan later this week that lays a foundation for approving President Trump's agenda, though a budget resolution has yet to be released.",
      "\"We'll be rolling out the details of that probably by tonight,\" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday, adding that \"we are right on the schedule that we need to be on.\"",
      "Leaders in Congress have been pursuing a massive legislative package under the budget reconciliation process that would enact Mr. Trump's agenda, including resources to bolster border security, extend some of the 2017 tax cuts, incentivize domestic manufacturing and invest in American energy, while working to trim government programs and address the debt limit. But the process has faced delays amid intraparty disagreement on how to proceed. And the stalled progress in the House has prompted the Senate to move ahead with its own proposal in recent days.",
      "House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington indicated in the House Republican conference meeting earlier Tuesday that a markup of the budget resolution would be scheduled for Thursday, Johnson said.",
      "Meanwhile, the Senate Budget Committee is scheduled to mark up its budget resolution Wednesday and Thursday. The committee's chairman, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, unveiled the resolution last week.",
      "The Senate version includes border security, defense and energy priorities, leaving the tax components for a later date. Senate Republicans have generally advocated a two-bill approach, citing the complicated nature of the tax components, while House Republicans have backed a one-bill strategy to get the priorities through their divided conference.",
      "Though the Senate had for weeks deferred to the House to kickstart the reconciliation process, frustrations came to a head among Senate Republicans last week, culminating in Graham's announcement that they would proceed with their own plan.",
      "Still, Johnson has repeatedly urged the Senate to let the House lead, saying Sunday that \"at the end of the day, the House has to drive this process \u2014 and we will.\"",
      "\"I appreciate the Senate's zeal, we have it in the House as well,\" Johnson said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But as I reminded my friend Lindsey, I have about 170 additional personalities to deal with and he's only got 53.\"",
      "Johnson, with a razor-thin GOP majority in the lower chamber, said he's made clear to Mr. Trump and his team that a one-bill strategy is essential, giving House Republicans the best chance to deliver on Mr. Trump's campaign promises. That's in part because of the difficulties posed by trying to pass two major bills under the budget reconciliation process.",
      "Using this approach, lawmakers can bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate in favor of a simple majority, which makes it easier to pass a bill in the upper chamber. But the final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit. And any new spending must be paid for, while the Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package to confirm that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences.",
      "The approval of a budget resolution marks the first key hurdle in the process. House Republicans had initially planned to hold a markup of the budget resolution last week, outlining a timeline to have the package on Mr. Trump's desk before May, but pushback from budget hawks for deeper spending cuts in recent weeks has slowed the process.",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, which has also advocated for a two-bill approach, released its own budget resolution Monday, which would allocate $200 billion for border security and defense, paired with $486 billion in spending cuts, and a proposed debt ceiling increase by $4 trillion.",
      "Graham told reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon that he spoke with Johnson at the Super Bowl and stressed that \"nothing would please me more than one big beautiful bill passed by the House that did all the things we need to do to make us prosperous and safe.\" But he said the Senate is moving forward because \"we're running out of money.\"",
      "The South Carolina Republican outlined that border czar Tom Homan and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought addressed the Senate GOP conference Tuesday and begged congressional Republicans to approve money for border security.",
      "Graham said to his GOP House colleagues, \"I wish you the best, I want one big beautiful bill, but I cannot and will not go back to South Carolina and justify not supporting the president's immigration plan. We're not building a wall, folks, we're hitting a wall. They need the money and they need it now.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that El Salvador's president offered to incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including U.S. citizens, but the deal came the same day as a less-publicized offer from the United States: nuclear power.",
      "El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. would help power the central American country \"at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices.\"",

      "Rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated Americans from the U.S. and \"put them in his jails.\"",
      "Bukele said he would charge the United States a \"relatively low\" fee to house convicted criminals in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a mega-prison built to hold up to 40,000 people. He said the nominal cost for America would help make \u00a0El Salvador's prison system sustainable.",
      "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, according to Edward Kee, who in 2022 was appointed to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant is a hundred-year deal. If a country in Central America signed up for a Russian or Chinese reactor, this would not be good for U.S. national security in the region,\" said Kee, who founded the Washington-based Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. \"This is especially a concern because these Russian and Chinese nuclear power deals usually include broader government-to-government arrangements.\"",
      "The United States is the largest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for about 30% of the worldwide total, according to the World Nuclear Association.",
      "Proponents say nuclear energy is one the most environmentally friendly, reliable existing energy resources, but critics view it as dangerous, wasteful and expensive.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright has promised to prioritize the production of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas under the Trump administration. Investors cheered and stocks jumped when Wright, a fossil fuel company executive, was nominated.",
      "Partner countries must sign what's known as a 123 Agreement with the United States before the U.S. licenses significant exports of U.S.-origin nuclear material and equipment. At their core, the agreements are intended to advance shared nuclear nonproliferation and security objectives between the United States and its partners, the State Department said in its information page outlining these agreements.",
      "The U.S. had 25 such agreements as of Feb. 3, including with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Norway and others. El Salvador would be the first and only country from Central America in that group.",
      "El Salvador is pursuing nuclear power \u2014 signing a similar agreement with Argentina in October \u2014 at a time when the barriers that have prevented smaller countries from developing it may be receding, according to Alfonso Blanco, the former executive director of the intergovernmental Latin American Energy Organization.",
      "\"There is a significant opportunity for the revival of nuclear energy through small-scale reactors, and the technology requires demonstration sites in countries that lack developed nuclear capacities,\" said Blanco, who now works for The Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \"This could represent a potential development path for El Salvador.\"",
      "Blanco said El Salvador and most other countries have limited options for procuring the necessary fuel for nuclear power because only eight countries have the technical capacity to enrich uranium.",
      "\"For El Salvador, positioning itself as a regional pioneer in the use of a new nuclear technology could present an interesting opportunity, especially considering that such infrastructure projects have significant spillover effects on job creation and local capacity development,\" Blanco said.",
      "But while the country's mega-prison is already built and ready to house tens of thousands of people, its nuclear plans are in their infancy.",
      "That means El Salvador is unlikely to close in on nuclear power while President Trump is in office, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.",

      "Homan reiterated that sentiment to other reporters at the White House, saying: \"I wish he'd stick to the Catholic Church and fix that and leave border enforcement to us.\"",

      "Francis acknowledged that nations have the right to defend themselves against migrants who have committed crimes, but he said that was not incompatible with policies for orderly and legal migration.",
      "Deporting people who fled extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious environmental deterioration in their home nations, regardless of how they enter the U.S., \"damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,\" the pope said.",
      "\"What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,\" Francis warned.",
      "The pope, 88, has made the defense of migrants and refugees a priority of his papacy since he was elected to lead the Catholic Church in 2013.\u00a0 Still, it is rare for a pontiff to so directly critique a country's internal political debate.",
      "The pope also rejected Vice President JD Vance's use of Catholic theology to justify the immigration crackdown.",
      "In a January 29 appearance on Fox News, Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, described what he said was \"a very Christian concept: You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"",
      "When critics responded that he had misunderstood the gospel, Vance took to social media to argue that a person's moral duties to their own children outweigh those, \"to a stranger who lives thousands of miles away.\"",
      "\"Just google 'ordo amoris,' Vance wrote, referring to a medieval Catholic concept on the \"order of love\" or \"order of charity\" to God, ourselves and our neighbors.",
      "While not mentioning Vance directly, Pope Francis directly contradicted the vice president's interpretation of Christian love in his Tuesday letter.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Francis also urged Catholics and others to, \"not give in to narratives that discriminate and cause needless suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.\"",

      "In February 2016, asked about Mr. Trump's vow to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, Francis said, \"building walls instead of bridges is not Christian.\"",
      "In January, Francis called Mr. Trump's plan to conduct mass deportations of undocumented migrants a \"disgrace.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 13:30:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The lawsuit from more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services.",
    "story": [
      "More than two-dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans \u2014 ranging from the Episcopal Church and the Union for Reform Judaism to the Mennonites and Unitarian Universalists \u2014 filed a\u00a0federal court lawsuit\u00a0Tuesday challenging a Trump administration move giving immigration agents more leeway to make arrests at houses of worship.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, contends that the new policy is spreading fear of raids, thus lowering attendance at worship services and other valuable church programs. The result, says the suit, infringes on the groups' religious freedom \u2014 namely their ability to minister to migrants, including those in the United States illegally.",
      "\"We have immigrants, refugees, people who are documented and undocumented,\" said the Most Rev. Sean Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",
      "\"We cannot worship freely if some of us are living in fear,\" he told The Associated Press. \"By joining this lawsuit, we're seeking the ability to gather and fully practice our faith, to follow Jesus' command to love our neighbors as ourselves.\"",
      "The new lawsuit echoes and expands on some of the arguments made in a similar lawsuit filed Jan. 27 by five Quaker congregations and later joined by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and a Sikh temple. It is currently pending in U.S. District Court in Maryland.",
      "There was no immediate Trump administration response to the new lawsuit, which names the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration enforcement agencies as defendants. However, a memorandum filed Friday by the Department of Justice, opposing the thrust of the Quaker lawsuit, outlined arguments that may also apply to the new lawsuit.",
      "In essence, the memo contended that the plaintiffs' request to block the new enforcement policy is based on speculation of hypothetical future harm \u2014 and thus is insufficient grounds for issuing an injunction.",
      "The memo said that immigration enforcement affecting houses of worship had been permitted for decades, and the new policy announced in January simply said that field agents \u2014 using \"common sense\" and \"discretion\" \u2014 could now conduct such operations without pre-approval from a supervisor.",
      "One part of that memo might not apply to the new lawsuit, as it argued the Quakers and their fellow plaintiffs have no basis for seeking a nationwide injunction against the revised enforcement policy.",
      "\"Any relief in this case should be tailored solely to the named plaintiffs,\" said the DOJ memo, contending that any injunction should not apply to other religious organizations.",
      "Who are the plaintiffs in the lawsuit?",
      "The plaintiffs in the new lawsuit represent a vastly larger swath of American worshippers \u2014 including more than 1 million followers of Reform Judaism, the estimated 1.5 million Episcopalians in 6,700 congregations nationwide, nearly 1.1 million members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and the estimated 1.5 million active members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church \u2014 the country's oldest predominantly Black denomination.",
      "Among the other plaintiffs are the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), with more than 3,000 congregations; the Church of the Brethren, with more than 780 congregations; the Convenci\u00f3n Bautista Hispana de Texas, encompassing about 1,100 Hispanic Baptist churches; the Friends General Conference, an association of regional Quaker organizations; the Mennonite Church USA, with about 50,000 members; the Unitarian Universalist Association, with more than 1,000 congregations; the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, with more than 500 U.S. congregations; and regional branches of the United Methodist Church and the United Church of Christ.",
      "\"The massive scale of the suit will be hard for them to ignore,\" said Kelsi Corkran, a lawyer with the Georgetown University Law Center's\u00a0Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection\u00a0who is lead counsel for the lawsuit.",
      "The plaintiffs joined the suit, she said, \"because their scripture, teaching, and traditions offer irrefutable unanimity on their religious obligation to embrace and serve the refugees, asylum seekers, and immigrants in their midst without regard to documentation or legal status.\"",
      "Prior to the recent Trump administration change, Corkran said immigration agents generally needed a judicial warrant or other special authorization to conduct operations at houses of worship and other \"sensitive locations\" such as schools and hospitals.",
      "\"Now it's go anywhere, any time,\" she told the AP. \"Now they have broad authority to swoop in \u2014 they've made it very clear they'll get every undocumented person.\"",
      "She cited a recent incident in which a Honduran man was arrested outside his family's Atlanta-area church while a service was being held inside.",
      "The lawsuit includes details from some of the plaintiffs as to how their operations might be affected. The Union for Reform Judaism and the Mennonites, among others, said many of their synagogues and churches host on-site foodbanks, meal programs, homeless shelters and other support services for undocumented people who might now be fearful of participating.",
      "One of the plaintiffs is the Latino Christian National Network, which seeks to bring together Latino leaders with different traditions and values to collaborate on pressing social issues. The network's president is the Rev. Carlos Malav\u00e9, a pastor of two churches in Virginia, who described to the AP what network members are observing.",
      "\"There is deep-seated fear and distrust of our government,\" he said. \"People fear going to the store, they are avoiding going to church. ... The churches are increasingly doing online services because people fear for the well-being of their families.\"",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads the nation's largest denomination, did not join the lawsuit, though it has criticized Mr. Trump's migration crackdown. On Tuesday, Pope Francis issued a major rebuke of the deportation plan, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \"will end badly.\"",
      "Many conservative faith leaders and legal experts across the U.S. do not share concerns about the new arrest policy.",
      "\"Places of worship are for worship and are not sanctuaries for illegal activity or for harboring people engaged in illegal activity,\" said Mat Staver, founder of the conservative Christian legal organization Liberty Counsel.",
      "\"Fugitives or criminals are not immune from the law merely because they enter a place of worship,\" he said via email. \"This is not a matter of religious freedom. There is no right to openly violate the law and disobey law enforcement.\"",
      "Professor Cathleen Kaveny, who teaches in the theology department and law school at Boston College, questioned whether the plaintiffs would prevail with the religious freedom argument, but suggested the administration might be unwise to disregard a traditional view of houses of worship as places of sanctuary for vulnerable people.",
      "\"These buildings are different \u2014 almost like embassies,\" she said. \"I think of churches as belonging to an eternal country.\"",

    "summary": "South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace is raising allegations against a former fianc\u00e9 and his business associates.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, in a nearly hour-long speech on the U.S. House floor Monday, accused her ex-fianc\u00e9 of physically abusing her, recording sex acts with her and others without their consent, and conspiring with business associates in acts of rape and sexual misconduct.",
      "Mace said she was speaking out because her home state's top prosecutor didn't take action even after she alerted investigators. That same prosecutor is likely to be Mace's opponent if she runs for governor of South Carolina in 2026, which she has said she's considering.",
      "Saying she was going \"scorched earth,\" Mace detailed how, in November 2023, she says she \"accidentally uncovered some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable.\"",
      "\"We're talking about rape, non-consensual photos, non-consensual videos of women and underage girls, and the premeditated, calculated exploitation of women and girls in my district,\" Mace said.",
      "Mace mentioned four men as being involved, including Charleston-area businessman Patrick Bryant, who was her fianc\u00e9 until 2023 and campaigned door-to-door for her during her 2022 reelection campaign.",
      "The AP wasn't able to independently verify Mace's claims. Bryant told the AP, \"I categorically deny these allegations. I take this matter seriously and will cooperate fully with any necessary legal processes to clear my name.\"",
      "Mace accused South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson of slow-walking any investigation of Bryant and the other men after she had brought the photos and video to state authorities.",
      "\"Did South Carolina's attorney general have any of these predators indicted after being provided clear cut-and-dry evidence including video, photos and witnesses?\" Mace asked, noting that her office had stood up a tip line for anyone with information on the allegations.",
      "In a statement after Mace's speech, Wilson's office called her comments regarding the prosecutor's conduct \"categorically false\" and said the office \"has not received any reports or requests for assistance from any law enforcement or prosecution agencies regarding these matters.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Democratic House Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California said he did not see Mace's floor speech but had read a report about it. He said she raised \"very serious allegations,\" and added, \"I would hope that law enforcement will take a look if there is something there, but I'm not minimizing the importance of what she said, or the allegations that she's that she's made or the protected manner in which she's doing it from the House floor.\"",
      "Mace, a former South Carolina state House member, was the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, the state's military college, where her father then served as commandant of cadets. Briefly serving in the state House, in 2020 she became the first Republican woman elected to represent South Carolina in Congress, flipping the 1st District after a single term with a Democratic representative.",
      "Her decision to air the allegations in a floor speech was unusual. In a release, Mace stressed that members' statements on the House floor \"are quintessential 'legislative acts'\" and thereby protected by the \"speech or debate\" clause, which generally protects lawmakers from being sued for what they say.",
      "\"This isn't a story about bitter ex-girlfriends or consensual sex tapes \u2014 there are plenty of those. I don't care what two consenting adults agree to do,\" Mace said. She mentioned a dozen bills on which she had worked in the House, on topics ranging from stopping voyeurism to banning transgender women from using women's bathrooms at the U.S. Capitol or House office buildings.",
      "In 2019, Mace spoke publicly for the first time about a sexual assault she said had occurred more than two decades earlier, addressing South Carolina legislative colleagues in advocating for adding a rape and incest exception to a state House ban on all abortions after detection of a fetal heartbeat.",
      "On Monday, Mace said she was joined in the House gallery by several women she said had been victimized by Bryant and the other men. Among the Republican lawmakers who sat behind Mace during her speech to show their support were Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "\"Nancy Mace is our friend and we wanted to support her and give her the encouragement she needed to get that message out,\" Boebert said.",
      "Mace, 47, won a third U.S. House term in November and has said that she is \"seriously considering\" a 2026 run for South Carolina governor. If she enters that race, she will likely face Wilson \u2014 in his fourth term and also the son of Rep. Joe Wilson \u2014 in the GOP primary.",
      "Mace has largely supported President Trump, working for his 2016 campaign but levying criticism against him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, critique that spurred Trump to back a GOP challenger in her 2022 race. Mace defeated that opponent, won reelection and was endorsed by Trump in her 2024 campaign.",
      "Mace declined additional comment to reporters in the Capitol after the speech. Asked how she felt now, she said, \"I'm at peace.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Pentagon is changing the name of the military base Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg, reversing a decision made by a congressionally mandated commission to rename bases that honor Confederate generals.",
      "The Army base will be renamed Fort Bragg, but it will honor a different Bragg than its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, who fought for the Confederacy. Instead, it will honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, who was awarded a Silver Star for actions during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\"This decision reflects the installation's proud history of honoring selfless service and sacrifice in defense of the nation,\" Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said in a statement.",
      "NBC News was first to report the Defense Department was considering this option.",
      "Roland L. Bragg was submitted by the public as one of thousands of candidates for a new name in 2023, but ultimately officials decided to name it Fort Liberty, instead of naming the base after any single person.",
      "On the campaign trail, President Trump criticized the renaming. At an October rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2014 near where the military installation is located \u2014  Mr. Trump said, \"We did win two world wars from Fort Bragg, right?\" and promised, \"We're gonna get it back. We're gonna bring our country back.\"",
      "Before he became defense secretary, Pete Hegseth said the base should never have been renamed. While promoting his book \"War on Warriors,\" Hegseth said, \"We should change it back, because legacy matters. My uncle served at Bragg. I served at Bragg. It breaks a generational link.\"",
      "When he entered the Pentagon for the first time, he referred to Fort Liberty and Fort Moore by their former names, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning.",
      "Fort Bragg and Fort Benning were two of nine bases that the Naming Commission, a commission mandated by Congress to rename bases honoring Confederates, for which new names were suggested.",
      "Back-to-back annual defense authorization bills first banned the military service branches from naming installations after Confederates and then created the Naming Commission. In 2020, Mr. Trump vetoed the defense bill, in part because of the base-renaming provision, but the House and Senate overrode his veto. The service branches, like the Army, still have the authority to rename bases as long as they're not named for Confederates.",
      "The base is home to the Army's Special Operations and Airborne forces, including the 82nd Airborne Division, which is often considered the tip of the spear by the U.S. military because it can rapidly deploy within 18 hours of notification.",
      "Fort Bragg officially became Fort Liberty during a ceremony in June 2023.",
      "The Naming Commission estimated that changing the name of Fort Bragg to Fort Liberty would initially cost over $6 million, according to the commission's report. It's not clear how much it will cost to change the name back to Fort Bragg.",

      "Bannon won't serve time behind bars under the plea agreement, which was laid out during a hearing in a New York courtroom on Tuesday. In exchange for pleading guilty to one count of scheming to defraud in the first degree, he received a sentence of conditional discharge for three years. During that time, Bannon is forbidden from serving as the director of any nonprofit in New York or raise money for charities with assets in the state. He was also forbidden from using donor data stemming from the scheme.",
      "The plea brings to an end a matter that began during President Trump's first administration, just as Mr. Trump has vowed again to beef up border barriers in the early days of his new presidency. Bannon served as Mr. Trump's chief strategist for the first seven months of his presidency in 2017.",
      "Bannon was charged\u00a0in September 2022 for his role in an organization that raised millions for an effort to privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. He and the group, which was called We Build the Wall, were accused of defrauding donors of $15 million in donations, though Bannon's lawyer said Tuesday he didn't personally pocket any of the money.",
      "The Trump ally attended the hearing in his usual courtroom attire, a brown jacket and untucked black button-down shirt, over gray jeans. He was charged with two counts of money laundering in the second degree, two counts of conspiracy in the fourth degree, a scheme to defraud in the first degree and conspiracy in the fifth degree. Under the plea agreement, Bannon entered a guilty plea to just the first degree scheme to defraud charge. He also waived his right to appeal the case.",

That prosecution came to an abrupt halt when Bannon was pardoned by Mr. Trump in the final hours of his first term in office. Mr. Trump's pardon authority extends to federal matters, meaning he is not able to pardon Bannon in this case, which is in a New York State court.",

He has decried all the cases against him, claiming they were driven by political animus.",

    "story": [
      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",
      "\"I'd like to see that deregulatory flavor making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance promoted America-first AI policies during his address, echoing a push by French President Emmanuel Macron for the EU to embrace a deregulatory environment to encourage more AI development on the continent.",
      "Macron said Monday that France generates enough clean electric power to build artificial intelligence centers, which require massive amounts of energy.",
      "\"I have a good friend on the other part of the ocean saying 'drill, baby, drill,'\" Macron said, in reference to President Trump and his push for fossil fuel energy. \"Here, there is no need to 'drill, baby, drill.' It is just 'plug, baby, plug.'\"",
      "Though the intent of the summit, which Macron is co-hosting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was to establish standards for more sustainable AI in the public interest, it has been overshadowed by the race between global powers to become the dominant country in the sector.",
      "Major American tech CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and OpenAI's Sam Altman are attending the summit, as well as world leaders, including Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing.",
      "Vance said the Trump administration would ensure that the U.S. continues to be the partner of choice for foreign countries and businesses in developing AI.",
      "While the vice president did not mention China \u2014 or its new AI company DeepSeek \u2014 he put \"hostile foreign adversaries\" who have \"weaponized A.I. software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech\" on notice.",
      "\"I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American A.I. and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to advert areas attaining A.I. capabilities that threaten all of our people.\"",
      "He extended the warning to allies as well.",
      "\"I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.

The bureau did not say what the records contain.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on his first week in office that called for the declassification of files related to the assassinations of Kennedy, his brother Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "The order gave the director of national intelligence and attorney general 15 days to present a plan to the president for the \"full and complete release of records\" related to Kennedy's assassination.",
      "Congress in 1992 enacted the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which required all assassination-related material be kept in a single collection within the National Archives and be publicly released. The law gave federal agencies 25 years to process and disclose the documents, with exceptions. The collection at the National Archives consists of more than 5 million pages of records.",
      "The National Archives has over the last three decades made material related to Kennedy's assassination available to the public, with the latest batch disclosed in August 2023. The agency said in December 2022 that more than 97% of records in its Kennedy collection are available to the American people.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court formally granted the Justice Department's request to drop the case against two of President Trump's co-defendants in the prosecution over his handling of classified documents, bringing an end to the last remaining case stemming from former special counsel Jack Smith's investigations.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, dismissed the case against Trump aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira in a one-line order on Tuesday. Hayden O'Byrne, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, asked the court to dismiss the government's appeal of an earlier order in late January.",
      "\"This appeal is dismissed,\" the court said.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with helping to obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.",
      "The prosecution was brought by Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House four years ago, and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.",
      "The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's election in November, Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira. Smith handed the case over to the U.S. Attorney's Office before he resigned.",
      "The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win.",

      "The system's new description for the Gulf, an ocean basin that shares nearly equal lengths of shoreline with the U.S. and Mexico, reads: \"The Gulf of America, formerly known as the Gulf of Mexico, with an average depth 5300 ft is a major body of water bordered and nearly landlocked by North America with the Gulf's eastern, northern, and northwestern shores in the U.S. and its southwestern and southern shores in Mexico.\"",
      "The description notes that the change complies with Mr. Trump's order titled \"Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness,\" which he signed on Inauguration Day. Google previously acknowledged Mr. Trump's executive order would affect what U.S. users see in their Maps applications but said the company would take its cue from the Board on Geographic Names, which handles federal nomenclature, to act on the directive.",
      "Although people accessing Google Maps from inside the U.S. will see the name Gulf of America, users in Mexico will continue to see the basin's earlier title. Maps users everywhere else in the world will see both names, Google said.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he would give Hamas until noon Saturday to release all Israeli hostages.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump issued an ultimatum on Monday to Hamas, saying that if all remaining Israeli hostages are not released from Gaza by noon on Saturday, then \"all hell is going to break loose.\"",
      "Asked by reporters for details on what that meant, Mr. Trump initially responded: \"You'll find out, and they'll find out, too. Hamas will find out what I mean.\"",
      "He then said ending the ceasefire that took effect on January 19 would be \"Israel's decision,\" but that he felt it would be \"appropriate\" to cancel the agreement if the hostages aren't released by his deadline. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, a total of 33 Israeli hostages were to be released during a six-week first phase, in exchange for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.",
      "As of Monday, about three weeks into phase-one, about half of the hostages due to be released have thus far been freed, in line with the schedule laid out in the agreement. There are 76 hostages still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza. On Tuesday, the IDF announced that the oldest one of them, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered by Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comments about the hostages while signing executive orders on Monday at the White House. He spoke hours after Hamas said it was delaying the next release of hostages, which was scheduled for Saturday, as a spokesman\u00a0accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement, including by targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes.",
      "\"This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed,\" said Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas' plan to delay the next release of hostages was \"a complete violation\" of the ceasefire agreement and that he had instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The prime minister's coordinator for hostages said the Israeli government intended to live up to its end of the agreement.",
      "But as Mr. Trump threatened to upend that agreement, he said Saturday's delayed hostage release \u2014 which was expected to see the release of another three hostages held by Hamas in exchange for dozens more Palestinian prisoners \u2014 should include all of the remaining hostages.",
      "\"I'd say they ought to  be returned by 12 o'clock on  Saturday,\" Mr. Trump said. \"All of them,  not in  drips and drabs,  not two and one and three and four and two.\"",
      "A senior Hamas leader told the French news agency AFP on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's warning over the hostages \"further complicates matters.\" It came just days after negotiations were meant to begin in earnest to lay out the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire.",
      "\"Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties and this is the only way to return the prisoners (hostages),\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. \"The language of threats has no value and further complicates matters,\" he said.",
      "Separately, in part of an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday but only released on Monday, Mr. Trump said Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza and he \"would own this,\" referring to his statements last week that the U.S. would \"take over\" and \"own\" the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should not return.",
      "Israel and Hamas have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 18 hostages, including Keith Siegel, who has dual U.S.-Israeli nationality, and over 730 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The most recent exchange, which took place on Feb. 8, caused some alarm because of the emaciated condition of the three male hostages who were released by Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the three male hostages \"endured hell itself,\" after seeing the state of the men.",
      "The plan put forth by the president has drawn increasingly robust backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday called it \"new, creative, and revolutionary,\" but it has been roundly condemned by many nations in the region and around the world, including the neighbors of Israel to which Mr. Trump has said Gaza's population should be relocated.",

      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",
      "But the Biden administration had no known influence on NASA's decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission, a plan that has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 spacecraft was launched with a two-man crew and two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "And in any case, there was no need to \"go get\" the astronauts given the Crew 9 spacecraft, the Starliner crew's ride home, has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",

      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

    "story": [
      "Australia-based scientists said Thursday they had produced the world's first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilization and hailed it as a key step towards saving endangered marsupials.",
      "The University of Queensland-led team said it employed the technique on eastern grey kangaroos -- which number in the millions -- with the aim of eventually using IVF for scarcer marsupials.",
      "\"Australia is home to the greatest diversity of marsupial fauna on the planet but it also has the highest mammal extinction rate,\" lead researcher Andres Gambini said in a statement.",
      "\"Our ultimate goal is to support the preservation of endangered marsupial species like koalas, Tasmanian devils, northern hairy-nosed wombats and Leadbeater's possums.\"",
      "Scientists produced the embryos by a technique that involves injecting a single sperm directly into a mature egg.",
      "\"Because eastern grey kangaroos are overabundant, we collected their eggs and sperm for use as a model to adapt the embryo technologies already applied to domestic animals and humans,\" Gambini said. \"We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm.\"",
      "With the right collaboration, funding and technical advancements, an IVF-assisted marsupial birth might be possible within a decade, the researcher said.",
      "Overall kangaroo numbers fluctuate between 30 million and 60 million in Australia, and they're frequently culled to keep populations in check.",
      "The animals have a \"boom and bust\" population cycle -- when food is plentiful following a good wet season, their numbers can balloon by tens of millions. But some other marsupial populations are far more precarious.",
      "It's estimated that there are only 20,000 to 50,000 Tasmanian devils in the wild, for example, down from as many as 150,000 before a mysterious facial tumor disease first struck in the mid-1990s.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 09:13:58 -0500",
    "summary": "Astronomers will use the Webb telescope to closely monitor the size and trajectory of an asteroid that has a slim chance of hitting Earth in 2032.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid has a small chance of hitting Earth less than eight years from now, and astronomers are enlisting the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope to study it. Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",

The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",

      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",

      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",

We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

      "Roman Berezhnoy, 33, and Egor Nikolaevich Glebov, 39, allegedly used ransomware software called Phobos to hack victim computer networks, copy and steal files and programs, then encrypt the original data, according to a news release from the DOJ. Once the original data was encrypted, the men and others involved in the scheme would allegedly extort the victims for ransom payments in exchange for keys that would allow the victims to access the data again.",
      "The men also allegedly threatened to expose stolen files, and allegedly operated a site on the dark web where stolen data was published. Victims of the scheme included a children's hospital, health care providers, and educational institutions, the Justice Department said. Victims lost data and money.",

      "Each has been charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse, three counts of causing intentional damage to protected computers, three counts of extortion in relation to damage to a protected computer, one count of transmitting a threat to impair the confidentiality of stolen data, and one count of unauthorized access and obtaining information from a protected computer.",
      "If convicted, each wire fraud-related charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Each computer damage count has a maximum penalty of 10 years. The remaining counts each have a maximum penalty of five years.",
      "The arrests come as international authorities announced a number of actions against cybercriminals. Recently, Russian national Evgenii Ptitsyn was arrested and extradited on charges related to his alleged administration of Phobos ransomware. European and German authorities also announced an operation involving the FBI and other law enforcement partners that had disrupted over 100 servers associated with the criminal network Berezhnoy and Glebov were a part of, the Department of Justice said.",

      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",

      "Though the intent of the summit, which Macron is co-hosting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was to establish standards for more sustainable AI in the public interest, it has been overshadowed by the race between global powers to become the dominant country in the sector.",

      "Vance said the Trump administration would ensure that the U.S. continues to be the partner of choice for foreign countries and businesses in developing AI.",
      "While the vice president did not mention China \u2014 or its new AI company DeepSeek \u2014 he put \"hostile foreign adversaries\" who have \"weaponized A.I. software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech\" on notice.",
      "\"I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American A.I. and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to advert areas attaining A.I. capabilities that threaten all of our people.\"",
      "He extended the warning to allies as well.",
      "\"I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term.

      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of eight former internal government watchdogs who were fired by President Trump filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging their terminations.",
      "The legal challenge, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C, argues that their firings violate federal laws meant to protect inspectors general from interference with their oversight duties. One of those laws, passed in 2022 with bipartisan support in both chambers, requires a president to give Congress 30 days notice before removing an inspector general and provide the \"substantive rationale, including detailed and case-specific reasons\" for the termination.",
      "The former inspectors general involved in the lawsuit worked at the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, State, Education, Agriculture and Labor, as well as the Small Business Administration. The lawsuit names the president and the heads of those departments and agencies as defendants.",
      "Inspectors general are nonpartisan and are tasked with conducting audits and investigations of the agencies they oversee to protect against waste, fraud and abuse. They have typically been appointed regardless of political affiliation and must be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "\"President Trump's attempt to eliminate a crucial and longstanding source of impartial, non-partisan oversight of his administration is contrary to the rule of law,\" they said in the 32-page lawsuit, which called the firings \"unlawful and unjustified.\"",
      "The watchdogs said that the agencies revoked access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and collected their equipment, such as government-issued phones and computers and access badges. The officials said they were also \"physically disabled\" from entering the government buildings where they work. Agency employees also arranged for the inspectors general to collect their personal belongings from their offices, the lawsuit states.",
      "\"These actions have had their intended effect of making it impossible for the IGs to perform their lawful duties,\" the lawsuit states. \"Because the purported removals were illegal and hence a nullity, the actions just described constituted illegal interference with the IGs' official duties.\"",
      "The watchdogs are asking the court to declare that their removals are void, which would mean that they are still duly appointed inspectors general of their respective agencies until the president removes them in compliance with federal law.",
      "Mr. Trump fired the internal government watchdogs on Jan. 24, four days into his second term. They were notified in a two-line email from the Office of Presidential Personnel stating that \"due to changing priorities your position as inspector general ... is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service.\"",
      "The president told reporters late last month that the firings were \"standard\" and a \"very common thing to do.\"",
      "But the inspectors general argued in their lawsuit that Mr. Trump's claims are wrong, as presidents of both parties \u2014 including the president during his first term \u2014 refrained from removing the internal watchdogs that were in place by their predecessors.",
      "They also said that Mr. Trump has not communicated to Congress his intention to remove the inspectors general or provided a \"substantive rationale,\" as required by law.",
      "\"IGs must be watchdogs, not lapdogs,\" the lawsuit states. \"The deleterious consequences of the Trump administration's contrary approach are hard to overstate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's decision to terminate the officials set off alarm bells in Congress. In the wake of his action, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and ranking member Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, sent the president a letter asking him to provide the legally required 30-day notice and reasons for their removal.",
      "Grassley sponsored the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, which laid out the requirements for getting rid of an inspector general.",
      "\"While IGs aren't immune from committing acts requiring their removal and they can be removed by the president, the law must be followed,\" Grassley and Durbin wrote.",
      "They added: \"This is a matter of public and congressional accountability and ensuring the public's confidence in the Inspector General community, a sentiment shared more broadly by other members of Congress. IGs are critical to rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct within the Executive Branch bureaucracy, which you have publicly made clear you are also intent on doing.\"",
      "The lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump's removal of the watchdogs is one of more than four dozen that have been filed in courts from coast to coast against the administration. Several of those legal battles target the president's firing of government officials, including the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Office of Special Counsel, which investigates retaliation against whistleblowers and violations of the Hatch Act, as well as a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.",

Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, is leading the charge in the upper chamber and outlined to reporters Tuesday that while he supports the House's effort to approve a single package, lawmakers can't wait to iron out the complicated tax details.",
      "\"I wish you the best, I want one big beautiful bill,\" Graham said to his House colleagues. \"But I cannot and will not go back to South Carolina and justify not supporting the president's immigration plan. We're not building a wall, folks, we're hitting a wall. They need the money and they need it now.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters after the House budget was released Wednesday morning that it remains to be seen how the development will affect the Senate's path forward, saying he met with House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday and \"we're coordinating.\"",
      "\"Members on our side have been prepared to act for awhile,\" Thune said. \"So we'll see what the House is able to get done and produce and then we'll go from there.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:45:50 -0500",
    "summary": "While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While the Trump administration has highlighted transfers of dangerous criminals and suspected gang members to Guantanamo Bay, it is also sending nonviolent, \"low-risk\" migrant detainees who lack serious criminal records or any at all, according to two U.S. officials and internal government documents.",
      "When he ordered officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into a large-scale immigration detention site late last month, President Trump said it would house the \"worst\" migrants and \"provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "Administration officials have since touted military flights to Guantanamo that they said have transported migrants in the U.S. illegally who have also committed violent crimes like murder and rape, as well as alleged members of Tren de Aragua, the infamous gang that originated in Venezuelan prisons.",
      "Internal documents and interviews with U.S. officials indicate the administration has sent migrant criminals and alleged gang members to Guantanamo, detaining them in the post-9/11 maximum-security prison that also houses, in a separate section, more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "But in addition to sending those with criminal records or suspected or known gang ties \u2014 classified as \"high-risk\" detainees \u2014 U.S. officials have also transported migrants deemed to be \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, according to the government documents obtained by CBS News. More low-risk migrants are expected to be transported on Wednesday, alongside high-risk detainees, the documents show.",
      "Federal immigration authorities define low-risk detainees as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who have not been arrested or convicted of violent offenses or other serious crimes, government guidelines show. U.S. officials said they could include migrants who lack any criminal record but have been ordered deported because of civil immigration violations, like entering the country without proper documents.",
      "While the high-risk migrants have been detained in cells at Guantanamo's maximum-security prison, the low-risk detainees have been placed in a barrack-like facility known as the Migrant Operations Center that includes rooms with restrooms, according to the documents and one of the U.S. officials, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "The State Department has traditionally used the Migrant Operations Center to house asylum-seekers intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard, while they wait to be resettled in third countries.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. The department oversees the ICE officials who have legal custody over the migrant detainees at Guantanamo.",
      "In two weeks, officials have made some progress in operationalizing Mr. Trump's instructions to establish the facilities needed to detain as many as 30,000 unauthorized migrants at the base in Guantanamo, a 45-square mile stretch of Cuban land that the U.S. has leased for over a century.",
      "Over the past week, U.S. service members at the base have been erecting tents to house migrant detainees beyond the prison and Migrant Operations Center, both of which have limited capacities.",
      "Officials have also been meeting the administration's goal of transporting groups of detainees to the base daily, sending six consecutive military flights over the past six days. The flights, however, have only carried up to 15 detainees each, due to limits on how many can be transported at one time once they reach the base.",
      "As of late Tuesday, nearly 100 unauthorized migrants were being held at Guantanamo, all of them adults from Venezuela, one of the U.S. officials said. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said recently the detainees will be held there until they can be deported, but it's unclear when that could happen.",
      "In recent years, Venezuela's repressive government has generally rejected American deportation flights, citing the economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. Under a recently brokered agreement with the Trump administration, Venezuela sent two planes to the Texas border earlier this week to pick nearly 200 of its citizens who were in U.S. immigration custody and transport them back to Venezuela. But similar flights to Guantanamo have not been announced.",
      "While some Republican lawmakers have praised the Trump administration for using Guantanamo to hold migrant detainees, the effort has alarmed pro-immigrant civil rights groups. They have accused the administration of using the naval base as a \"legal black hole\" to hold migrants \"incommunicado,\" demanding that the detainees be given access to lawyers.",
      "While the transportation of low-risk migrants to Guantanamo undermines statements from Trump officials that the facility would be used to house \"the worst of the worst,\" it also reinforces a message the administration has communicated repeatedly: no one who is in the U.S. illegally will be shielded from detention and deportation, even if they lack criminal histories.",

    "story": [
      "A woman who was found dead in 1982 has finally been identified, more than 40 years after her death.",
      "The remains were found by a real estate agent assessing land in Loxahatchee, Florida, in December 1982, according to a news release from Othram, a company that uses genetic genealogy to help solve cold cases. Loxahatchee is in Palm Beach County, Florida, north of Miami.",
      "An investigation found that the remains were those of a White woman between the ages of 24 and 34. CBS News affiliate CW34 reported she was believed to have two or more children. She had been shot in the head, and the manner of death was ruled a homicide. At the time, investigators developed a DNA profile that was entered into the national database CODIS, but no matches were found. Details of the case were also entered into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.",
      "Alongside the remains were five pieces of jewelry, described by Othram as \"a silver handcrafted heart-shaped pinky ring, a gold mariner's anchor necklace with a 180-degree twist, a wristwatch, a four marquis cut ring, and a diamond ring with 14K white gold setting.\" When the remains could not be identified, the woman was nicknamed \"Jeweled Mom.\"",
      "For decades, the case remained cold. In 2021, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office teamed up with Othram to use advanced DNA testing. Forensic evidence was submitted to Othram's laboratory. Othram scientists extracted DNA from the evidence and used advanced methods to build another DNA profile.",
      "Othram's forensic genetic genealogy team then used that profile in a genealogy search, which created new leads about the woman's identity. Forensic genetic genealogy is used to try to find a DNA match to a person's relatives, rather than finding a direct match to the person. It has been used to identify both victims and perpetrators of crimes.",
      "Those genealogy leads were provided to investigators who launched a follow-up investigation. Investigators interviewed potential relatives, and collected a reference DNA sample from one possible relative. That sample was compared with the DNA profile created by Othram.",
      "The process allowed investigators to positively identify the remains as belonging to Leona Jean Keller. Keller was 37 years old when she died, Othram said.",
      "This is the 36th case in Florida where Othram has helped law enforcement identify a victim, according to the company.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:39:17 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" new CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

      "He and his classmates spent about 1.5 years in remote learning through the pandemic.",
      "Mohamed Koroma, an eighth grade English Language Arts teacher, said, \"We're still trying to fill in those gaps that they didn't get at the lower levels. Because it's hard to grapple with the eighth grade text if you are on a lower reading level.\"",
      "A study released Tuesday from Harvard, Stanford and Dartmouth also cites a widespread rise in absenteeism, especially in high-poverty districts.",
      "\"The biggest thing is to just get them inside the building,\" Koroma said. \"Once we get them in the building, learning is gonna happen.\"",
      "District of Colombia Public Schools chronic absenteeism was at 37% for the 2023-2024 school year, down from 41% the previous school year.",
      "But the new study found some bright spots: Despite the overall nationwide drop, more than 100 local school districts are performing better than they were before the pandemic in math and reading.",
      "Public schools in Washington, D.C., aren't there yet, but over the last two years, the nation's capital ranked first in the country in terms of recovery in math and reading \u2014 a marked improvement considering it ranks 32nd in math recovery from 2019-2024, and fifth in reading over that same time period.",
      "Kramer Middle School Principal Katreena Shelby said the turnaround at her school came when she \"started thinking maybe I need to think about this differently.\"",
      "\"How can we make classroom sizes smaller, but give kids more opportunities to get remediation during the school day?\" she said.",
      "One of the solutions was what's known as high-impact tutoring, where tutors are brought in to help students in the classroom during school hours. It's a program that's been successful in other districts as well.",
      "Washington also invested some of its pandemic funds in more teachers, giving $1,000 stipends to some who completed literacy training courses.",
      "Koroma says the training and professional development is \"making me a better teacher\u2026 Because our instruction improved, I think the quality of the work that the students are providing has improved.\"",
      "\"Giving kids that additional support in literacy and math didn't just impact how we were able to grow literacy skills, we also were able to reduce truancy by 20% in one year,\" Shelby said, adding that seeing their own progress, \"was encouraging them.\"",
      "\"They would come and run to me and say, Hey, look, here's my new math score. Look what I did in [English Language Arts]. And they were so excited to show me and that excitement translated into them coming to school more frequently,\" she said.",
      "Aiyden Wiggins agrees. He says his own attendance has improved. \"It's just the enjoyment and the energy at school,\" he said that makes him want to keep coming back.",

    "summary": "Influenza trends have reached record highs in recent weeks.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, more people in the U.S. died of influenza than from COVID-19 in the week ending on Jan. 25, according to weekly figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "For the week ending on Jan. 25, nearly 1.7% of all deaths nationwide were attributed to the flu, compared to roughly 1.5% being the result of COVID-19, according to CDC data. Rates of influenza hospitalizations are more than three times higher than COVID-19 hospitalizations amid this season's record wave of flu infections.",
      "Partial CDC data suggest that influenza deaths may have already reached as high as 2% of deaths for the week ending on Feb. 1, also surpassing COVID-19 mortality nationwide which was holding at around 1.5%. More complete data is expected to be published Friday.",
      "In 22 states, the rate of influenza deaths has been outpacing COVID-19 deaths throughout the first five weeks of 2025.",
      "The gap between flu and COVID-19 deaths is biggest in California, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon and Wyoming, where the percentage of weekly deaths from flu are at least double those from COVID-19.",
      "Health officials track the percentage of weekly deaths as an early indicator of trends in flu and COVID-19 deaths, since it can take several weeks for all deaths to be confirmed and counted.",
      "The agency's modelers estimate that between 13,000 and 65,000 flu deaths have occurred so far this season, already above the range of influenza deaths for all of last season.",
      "That is also a higher range than the between 18,000 and 31,000 deaths from COVID-19 that the CDC estimates have happened so far this winter.",
      "This winter's COVID-19 wave has been smaller than previous waves of the virus, measured both in emergency rooms and hospitalizations.",
      "No new highly mutated variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 has emerged to drive a major surge of infections, unlike several previous waves, and rates of vaccinations have outpaced several previous seasons in older adults who are more vulnerable to severe disease.",
      "By contrast, the CDC has tracked influenza activity climbing to some of the highest rates seen since the peak of the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Levels are \"very high\" in 33 states and the District of Columbia, the CDC said on Friday.",
      "Influenza vaccinations have lagged in some age groups, CDC data suggests, especially in children. Less than 45% of children in the U.S. have gotten a flu shot, down from more than 58% at this time of year in 2020.",
      "\"Foremost, anyone who has not been vaccinated for flu this season should get vaccinated immediately. Flu activity remains elevated and continues to increase across the country,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a Feb. 10 statement.",
      "Several factors can impact flu activity in the U.S., he said, including which flu viruses are circulating and the immunity people have from prior infections and vaccinations.",

    "story": [
      "Shark attacks \u2014 particularly deadly ones \u2014 dropped substantially last year around the world, a new report shows.",
      "The latest iteration of the\u00a0International Shark Attack File, a database run by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida, showed that shark attacks decreased dramatically in 2024 and was far below the annual average.",
      "\"Unprovoked shark bites plummeted in 2024,\" reads the headline of the report, which characterized the year as \"exceptionally calm\" for shark bites.",
      "Of 88 alleged shark-human interactions that researchers say they investigated last year, 71 bites were confirmed. The report segmented those incidents into unprovoked and provokes bites, of which there were 47 and 24, respectively. Seven of the attacks were fatal, including four unprovoked attacks, according to the research.",
      "Those figures did not account for instances where sharks attacked a boat or bit a human who was already dead. Several additional incidents where a person's injuries could not be indisputably attributed to a shark, over another predatory marine creature, were categorized as \"unconfirmed\" in the report.",
      "Confirmed attacks in 2024 dwarfed numbers reported in the previous year's International Shark Attack File, which recognized 91 global incidents, including 69 unprovoked bites and 22 provoked bites. Ten people died in shark attacks in 2023, with six killed in unprovoked attacks, researchers said at the time.",
      "The number of attacks last year was \"well below\" the 10-year average, of about 70 unprovoked shark bites recorded annually, the new report notes. It also calls the four unprovoked attacks a \"significant reduction\" compared with previous years.",
      "Our annual shark bite report for 2024 is now available online. There were only 47 unprovoked attacks, down 21 from the previous year and well below the 10-year average of 70.\ud83d\udcc9 Full story and data: https://t.co/yTWdm0F4GLSummary report: https://t.co/K18ueW2TLg pic.twitter.com/5QMBsXNdlr",
      "The International Shark Attack File considers attacks on a living human in the shark's natural habitat, who did not bother the animal prior to being bitten, \"unprovoked.\" It considers attacks that occur after a human has initiated some sort of contact with the shark \"provoked.\"",
      "Divers suffering bites after trying to touch or otherwise harass sharks, attacks on spearfishermen, bites on people who attempted to feed sharks, and bites that happen while a shark is being unhooked or removed from a fishing net, are some examples of scenarios that would meet criteria for a \"provoked\" attack.",
      "Unprovoked bites are of particular interest to the researchers studying shark attack patterns.",
      "\"We're interested in the natural patterns of shark behavior so that we can understand why people occasionally get bitten by these animals,\" said Gavin Naylor, the director of the Florida Program for Shark Research, in a statement. \"Any cue or attribute that modifies an animal's natural behavior is something that, we as scientists, want to exclude.\"",
      "Places with the most unprovoked shark attacks",
      "Most of 2024's unprovoked shark attacks happened in the United States, which follows a longstanding pattern, the new report notes. Last year, there were 28 confirmed shark bites in U.S. waters, accounting for 60% of the worldwide total despite being lower than the 36 unprovoked incidents confirmed in 2023.",
      "Half of U.S. attacks took place in Florida in 2024, which is also common for the state often known to experience the highest concentrations of shark bites of anywhere in the world. Like the national total, unprovoked shark bites were down in Florida, where the five-year average is 19 unprovoked attacks.",
      "Australia trailed the U.S. total with nine unprovoked bites, a sizable decrease from the country's five-year average of 15. Egypt, the Maldives, Western Sahara, the Turks and Caicos Islands, French Polynesia, Mozambique, India, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Belize each reported one unprovoked shark attack.",
      "The fatal attacks occurred in the U.S., Egypt, the Maldives and Western Sahara, with one death confirmed in each place, according to the Shark Attack File. Despite Florida's tally of unprovoked bites, the only U.S. death in a shark attack last year happened in Hawaii when surfer Tamayo Perry was killed off the island of Oahu. The species of shark involved in that attack is unknown, researchers said.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Marc Fogel, an American schoolteacher who had been held in Russia since 2021, arrived back on U.S. soil late Tuesday night after the White House announced earlier in the day it had negotiated his release.",
      "The White House released a photo of a jubilant Fogel disembarking a plane at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Alongside him were White House national security adviser Michael Waltz and Adam Boehler, the Trump administration's envoy for hostages.",
      "He was then taken to the White House, where he was greeted outside on the North Portico by President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, among others.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that a Russian citizen who was behind bars in the U.S. had been freed as part of the swap that included Fogel's release. Peskov said the Russian's identity would be disclosed once he or she was back in Russia.",
      "In a briefing with reporters alongside Mr. Trump in the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House, Fogel said, \"I feel like the luckiest man on Earth right now.\" He called the president \"a hero\" for facilitating his return.",
      "\"I'm a middle-class school teacher who's now in a dream world,\" Fogel said.",
      "The White House has declined to provide details about what the U.S. was giving up in the deal with Russia, and Mr. Trump also refused to say how it was reached, only describing the terms as \"very fair, very reasonable.\" The president also teased that \"somebody else is being released tomorrow that you will know of.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wouldn't disclose if he spoke directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of Fogel's release.",
      "Waltz had earlier said that Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, was leaving Russian airspace with Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was\u00a0designated as \"wrongfully detained\"\u00a0by the U.S. late last year.",
      "\"President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,\" he said in a statement. \"Since President Trump's swearing-in, he has successfully secured the release of Americans detained around the world, and President Trump will continue until all Americans being held are returned to the United States.\"",

      "Why was Marc Fogel detained?",
      "Fogel, a history teacher from Pennsylvania, was arrested by Russian authorities at the airport in Moscow in 2021. His family had said he was carrying 17 grams of marijuana for medical reasons to treat chronic back pain.",
      "His family had pushed for Mr. Trump's predecessor, former President Joe Biden, to secure his release, particularly after Fogel was left out of prisoner swaps negotiated by the previous administration. In December 2022, Russia released WNBA star Brittney Griner in a one-for-one prisoner swap for international arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Then, last August, the Biden administration secured the release of three more Americans from Russia \u2014 Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich, Marine veteran\u00a0Paul Whelan\u00a0and Russian-American radio journalist\u00a0Alsu Kurmasheva\u00a0\u2014 as part of a 24-person prisoner exchange.",
      "In addition to Fogel, that deal omitted several other Americans imprisoned in Russia, including musician\u00a0Michael Travis Leake, U.S. Army staff sergeant\u00a0Gordon Black\u00a0and Russian-American ballerina Ksenia Karelina.",
      "In a statement, Fogel's family thanked Mr. Trump and other allies who fought for his release.",
      "\"We are beyond grateful, relieved, and overwhelmed that after more than three years of detention, our father, husband, and son, Marc Fogel, is finally coming home,\" they said. \"Thanks to the unwavering leadership of President Trump, Marc will soon be back on American soil, free where he belongs. This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal.\"",
      "Martin De Luca and Andrew Smith, Fogel's legal team, also praised the president and his administration for their work in freeing him.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's release is historic, long overdue, and a testament to the power of strong leadership,\" they said. \"After years of bureaucratic inaction including consistent refusals to designate Marc as wrongfully detained, President Trump secured Marc's release in just a few weeks, wasting no time in taking decisive action to bring Marc home.\"",
      "Pennsylvania's senators, John Fetterman and Dave McCormick, cheered Fogel's release.",
      "\"Marc Fogel's return home is long overdue \u2014 and I know all of Pennsylvania, especially his family, will be welcoming him back with open arms,\" Fetterman, a Democrat,\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "\"I am thrilled that Marc Fogel is finally coming home after years of being wrongfully held in Russia,\" McCormick, a Republican, said in a post. \"I have been working with the administration on this since day one and I'm grateful to President Trump and Secretary Rubio for delivering on their commitment to free Marc. As I told Marc's Mom, Mafa, when we spoke in August, we had to do everything possible to get Marc home and it is a blessing that this day has finally come.\"",
      "Fogel's mother, Malphine Fogel, had criticized Biden and his administration for the delay in designating her son as wrongfully detained. That determination that is made by the secretary of state and clears the way for State Department offices and federal agencies to work together to develop a plan to secure the release of a detainee.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against the State Department last June, but the case was dismissed. Malphine Fogel was set to draw more public attention to her son's detainment during a July 13 rally with Mr. Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, but the campaign event was upended when a gunman opened fire on the crowd. The president and two others were injured, and one man was killed during the assassination attempt.",
      "\"I was going to be on stage with him and he was going to mention [Marc's] name,\" Malphine Fogel told CBS News Pittsburgh last July. \"We were going to put it out for the whole world to hear. Well, that didn't happen because we didn't get on stage.\"",

      "The two latest cases include the alleged killing of a 25-year-old woman in her apartment in Berlin in Sept. 2021, in which the 40-year-old doctor is suspected of giving the woman a lethal mixture of various drugs with the intention of killing her.",
      "In addition, he is suspected of murdering a 57-year-old woman last June, also in her apartment in Berlin, by administered a lethal mixture of medications, investigators said.",
      "Prosecutors and police said in a joint statement that the accused is said to have had no motive beyond killing, and that the suspect's acts meet the legal definition of \"lust for murder.\"",
      "According to the latest findings, the killings took place between Sept. 2021 and last summer.",
      "On Tuesday, police also called on former colleagues of the suspect or relatives of care recipients who have not had any contact with law enforcement but who may also have suspicions about the death of patients or relatives, urging them to reach out to the police.",
      "The suspect's name hasn't been released, in keeping with German privacy rules. Prosecutors say he hasn't yet responded to the allegations.",
      "The case recalls that of the notorious German nurse\u00a0Niels Hoegel, who was sentenced in 2019 to life in prison for murdering 85 patients in his care.",
      "Hoegel, believed to be Germany's\u00a0most prolific serial killer, murdered hospital patients with lethal injections between 2000 and 2005, before he was eventually caught in the act.",
      "In a more recent case in Germany, a 27-year-old male nurse was sentenced to life in prison in 2023 for murdering two patients by deliberately administering unprescribed drugs. The nurse, identified as Mario G., was also found guilty on six counts of attempted murder.",

    "title": "Tesla has sued customers and journalists in China for defamation",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 07:07:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Tesla has sued its own customers and journalists in China for defamation \u2013 and won just about every time. Elon Musk's company has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy there.",
    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",
      "In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Mr. Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others who've traditionally acted as guardrails.",
      "Tesla officials in China and the United States didn't reply to requests for comment.",
      "Tesla's hospitable business dynamics in China",
      "Tesla's record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts \u2014 which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party are, by design, somewhat intertwined.",
      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 06:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns in West Africa, which supplies around 70% of the world's cacao, are disrupting the crop, affecting both the quantity and quality of beans \u2014 and driving up prices for consumers.",
    "story": [
      "As Valentine's Day approaches, the craving for chocolate intensifies. But chocolate continues to face a significant challenge: Climate change is threatening cacao production, particularly in West Africa, which produces around 70% of the world's supply. Rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns are disrupting cacao crops, affecting both the quantity and quality of beans \u2014 and driving up prices for consumers.",
      "Cocoa prices surged 136% between July 2022 and February 2024, according to UNCTAD commodities price monitoring. For the first time, the price per metric ton on the futures market crossed $10,000 last March, according to the United Nations trade agency, which attributed the increases in part to climate change.",
      "A new analysis by scientists at research nonprofit Climate Central highlights how climate change has pushed temperatures above the optimal range for cacao trees in Western Africa. This analysis is \"the first that we know of that really tries to put a number on how much humans and climate change are influencing cocoa trees and cocoa production from West Africa,\" said Kristina Dahl, vice president for science at Climate Central.",
      "West African countries have long been the heart of cocoa production, producing around 3.48 million metric tons of cocoa beans in the 2022-2023 season. This massive output is vital to the global chocolate industry, where it takes about 400 cocoa beans to make just one pound of chocolate. Millions of farmers depend on the crop for their livelihoods. In Ghana, cocoa production provides employment for 3.2 million farmers and workers, more than 10% of its total population. \"Climate change is threatening the existence of cocoa farmers and their sources of livelihoods,\" says cocoa farmer Emmanuel Essah-Mensah from Ghana, who advises several hundred cocoa farms.",
      "Cacao trees are grown in regions within 10 degrees north and south of the equator where the climate is ideal for its cultivation. The crop \u2014 the raw, unprocessed form of cocoa beans \u2014 has two primary harvest periods in Western Africa: the main crop harvest from September to March and the mid-crop from May to August. After flowering, it takes about five to six months for the pods to mature. Once ripe, the pods are harvested by hand and then split open to extract the seeds, which undergo fermentation and drying processes to develop the flavors essential for chocolate production.",
      "The ideal temperature range for cacao growth is up to 32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 Fahrenheit, but recent trends indicate that climate change is increasing the number of days above this range. Climate Central examined temperature data from 44 cacao-producing districts, regions, or states in West Africa, including Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria. Over the past decade, approximately two-thirds of the cacao-growing region faced an increase of at least an additional six weeks' worth of days each year hotter than is ideal for the trees due to climate change, while one-third experienced at least eight additional weeks of excessive heat.",
      "Excessive heat severely impacts cacao production. Cacao plants rely on stable temperatures for proper photosynthesis, and too many hot days can affect photosynthesis, leading to shriveled flowers and smaller, rotting cacao pods.",
      "The impact of climate change extends beyond heat stress. Cacao trees are also sensitive to rainfall patterns. Cacao thrives when rainfall totals between 1,500 and 2,000 millimeters, or about 59 to 79 inches annually, with no dry spells longer than three months, according to the International Cocoa Organization . In July 2024, parts of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire saw 40% more rainfall than usual, flooding fields and damaging crops, while December brought little rain to the region, which slows photosynthesis, leading to fewer flowers and more underdeveloped beans. Erratic rainfall patterns are leaving farmers with unpredictable growing conditions, contributing to lower harvests and higher prices.",
      "To adapt, some farmers are turning to diverse, nature-friendly agricultural practices, such as planting taller trees between cacao plants, creating healthy fertile soils that hold onto moisture and providing protective shade for cacao plants. However, such strategies are not foolproof and can take time to implement. The future of cacao farming in a warming world remains uncertain, and ongoing challenges threaten to continue driving up the price of chocolate, making your favorite sweet treat pricier to enjoy."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump hosted Jordan's King Abdullah II at the White House on Tuesday and renewed his suggestions that Gaza could be emptied of residents, controlled by the U.S. and redeveloped as a tourist area \u2014 a plan that would likely only work if the Arab nation agrees to accept more Palestinian refugees.",
      "The pair met in the Oval Office, where Mr. Trump suggested he would not withhold U.S. aid to Jordan, Egypt or other Arab nations if they don't agree to dramatically increase the number of people they take in from Gaza.",
      "\"I don't have to threaten that. I do believe we're above that,\" Mr. Trump said. That contradicted his previous suggestion that holding back aid was a possibility.",
      "Abdullah was asked repeatedly about Mr. Trump's audacious plan to remake the Middle East, but didn't make substantive comments in the Oval Office on it, nor the idea that his country could accept large numbers of new refugees from Gaza. He did say that Jordan would accept roughly 2,000 children with cancer and other health problems \"right away.\" Mr. Trump said he did not know about that commitment, which he called \"a beautiful gesture.\"",
      "After their meeting, however, in a series of social media posts, King Abdullah \"reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\"",
      "\"This is the unified Arab position,\" he said. \"Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all. Achieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability. This requires US leadership. President Trump is a man of peace. He was instrumental in securing the Gaza ceasefire. We look to US and all stakeholders in ensuring it holds.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also repeated suggestions, during their meeting, that the U.S. could come to control Gaza, but that it wouldn't require committing American funds. Asked under what authority he could take control of the territory, he said: \"under the U.S. authority,\" without elaborating.",
      "\"We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it,\" Mr. Trump said of Gaza. He suggested the redeveloped area could have new hotels, office buildings and houses and, \"and we'll make it exciting.\"",
      "\"I can tell you about real estate. They're going to be in love with it,\" said Mr. Trump, who built a New York real estate empire that catapulted him to fame, while also insisting that he personally would not be involved in the development.",
      "Mr. Trump also renewed his suggestion during his meeting with Abdullah that the tenuous ceasefire between Hamas and Israel could be ended if Hamas doesn't release all the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday \u2014 a deadline that's not in line with the ceasefire terms agreed to by the parties.",
      "\"I don't think they're going to make the deadline, personally,\" Mr. Trump said of Hamas. \"They want to play tough guy. We'll see how tough they are.\"",
      "The king's visit came at a perilous moment for the Gaza ceasefire. Hamas accused Israel this week of violating the truce and said it was delaying further hostage releases under the agreement.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly proposed the U.S. take control of Gaza and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East,\" with Palestinians in the war-torn territory pushed into neighboring nations, with no right of return.",
      "His Tuesday comments contradicted his Monday suggestions that, if necessary, he would withhold U.S. funding from Jordan and Egypt \u2014 longtime U.S. allies and among the top recipients of its foreign aid \u2014 as a means of persuading them to accept additional Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and, along with other Arab states, has flatly rejected Mr. Trump's plan to relocate civilians from Gaza. Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said last week that his country's opposition to Mr. Trump's idea was \"firm and unwavering.\"",
      "Besides concerns about jeopardizing the long-held goals of a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Egypt and Jordan have privately raised security concerns about welcoming large numbers of additional refugees into their countries even temporarily.",
      "The king is also meeting with top Trump administration officials during his visit, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. He is the third foreign leader to hold an in-person meeting with Mr. Trump since his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The president announced his ideas for resettling Palestinians from Gaza and taking ownership of the territory for the U.S. during a press conference last week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He initially didn't rule out deploying U.S. troops to help secure Gaza but at the same time insisted no U.S. funds would go to pay for the reconstruction of the territory, raising fundamental questions about the nature of his plan.",
      "After Mr. Trump's initial comments, Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that Trump only wanted Palestinians relocated from Gaza \"temporarily\" and sought an \"interim\" period to allow for debris removal, the disposal of unexploded ordnance and reconstruction.",
      "But asked in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that aired Monday if Palestinians in Gaza would have a right to return to the territory under his plan, he replied, \"No, they wouldn't.\"",

    "summary": "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, one expert said.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week that El Salvador's president offered to incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including U.S. citizens, but the deal came the same day as a less-publicized offer from the United States: nuclear power.",
      "El Salvador's Foreign Minister Alexandra Hill Tinoco said a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. would help power the central American country \"at competitive pricing without depending on geopolitics or on oil prices.\"",
      "\"The experience that [the United States has] on civil nuclear energy will give us all of the tools we need to train our people, to train our Salvadoran experts, who will lead the technical and regulatory aspects of this transition \u2014 this unprecedented transition,\" Hill Tonoco said.",
      "Rubio hailed the nuclear cooperation agreement just before announcing that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, also agreed to take deportees and incarcerated Americans from the U.S. and \"put them in his jails.\"",
      "Bukele said he would charge the United States a \"relatively low\" fee to house convicted criminals in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a mega-prison built to hold up to 40,000 people. He said the nominal cost for America would help make \u00a0El Salvador's prison system sustainable.",
      "The nuclear agreement is a potential national security win for the United States, according to Edward Kee, who in 2022 was appointed to the Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee.",
      "\"A nuclear power plant is a hundred-year deal. If a country in Central America signed up for a Russian or Chinese reactor, this would not be good for U.S. national security in the region,\" said Kee, who founded the Washington-based Nuclear Economics Consulting Group. \"This is especially a concern because these Russian and Chinese nuclear power deals usually include broader government-to-government arrangements.\"",
      "The United States is the largest producer of nuclear energy, accounting for about 30% of the worldwide total, according to the World Nuclear Association.",
      "Proponents say nuclear energy is one the most environmentally friendly, reliable existing energy resources, but critics view it as dangerous, wasteful and expensive.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright has promised to prioritize the production of nuclear power and liquefied natural gas under the Trump administration. Investors cheered and stocks jumped when Wright, a fossil fuel company executive, was nominated.",
      "Partner countries must sign what's known as a 123 Agreement with the United States before the U.S. licenses significant exports of U.S.-origin nuclear material and equipment. At their core, the agreements are intended to advance shared nuclear nonproliferation and security objectives between the United States and its partners, the State Department said in its information page outlining these agreements.",
      "The U.S. had 25 such agreements as of Feb. 3, including with the United Kingdom, Singapore, Norway and others. El Salvador would be the first and only country from Central America in that group.",
      "El Salvador is pursuing nuclear power \u2014 signing a similar agreement with Argentina in October \u2014 at a time when the barriers that have prevented smaller countries from developing it may be receding, according to Alfonso Blanco, the former executive director of the intergovernmental Latin American Energy Organization.",
      "\"There is a significant opportunity for the revival of nuclear energy through small-scale reactors, and the technology requires demonstration sites in countries that lack developed nuclear capacities,\" said Blanco, who now works for The Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. \"This could represent a potential development path for El Salvador.\"",
      "Blanco said El Salvador and most other countries have limited options for procuring the necessary fuel for nuclear power because only eight countries have the technical capacity to enrich uranium.",
      "\"For El Salvador, positioning itself as a regional pioneer in the use of a new nuclear technology could present an interesting opportunity, especially considering that such infrastructure projects have significant spillover effects on job creation and local capacity development,\" Blanco said.",
      "But while the country's mega-prison is already built and ready to house tens of thousands of people, its nuclear plans are in their infancy.",
      "That means El Salvador is unlikely to close in on nuclear power while President Trump is in office, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy.",

    "summary": "President Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan says Pope Francis should \"stick to the Catholic Church,\" as the pontiff criticizes U.S. plans for mass deportations.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 President Trump's U.S. \"border czar\" Tom Homan lashed out Tuesday at Pope Francis after the leader of the Catholic Church strongly criticized the mass deportation of migrants that Mr. Trump has initiated in his second term.",
      "In an open letter to U.S. Catholic bishops sent Tuesday, the Argentinian pope criticized Mr. Trump's mass deportation program, saying those who entered the United States illegally should not be treated as criminals and that the overall plan could not be supported as it violates human dignity.",
      "When asked Tuesday by a Fox News reporter to comment on the pope's \"harsh words,\" Homan replied: \"I've got harsh words for the pope: I say this as a lifelong Catholic. He ought to focus on his work and leave enforcement to us. He's got a wall around the Vatican, does he not?\"",
      "Homan reiterated that sentiment to other reporters at the White House, saying: \"I wish he'd stick to the Catholic Church and fix that and leave border enforcement to us.\"",
      "In his letter to the bishops, Francis said he was closely following the \"major crisis\" in the U.S., but that the \"rightly formed conscience cannot fail to make a critical judgment and express its disagreement with any measure that tacitly or explicitly identifies the illegal status of some migrants with criminality.\"",
      "Fury in India over U.S. deportees seen leg-chained for long flight",
      "Fury in India over U.S. deportees seen leg-chained for long flight",
      "Francis acknowledged that nations have the right to defend themselves against migrants who have committed crimes, but he said that was not incompatible with policies for orderly and legal migration.",
      "Deporting people who fled extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious environmental deterioration in their home nations, regardless of how they enter the U.S., \"damages the dignity of many men and women, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness,\" the pope said.",
      "\"What is built on the basis of force, and not on the truth about the equal dignity of every human being, begins badly and will end badly,\" Francis warned.",
      "The pope, 88, has made the defense of migrants and refugees a priority of his papacy since he was elected to lead the Catholic Church in 2013.\u00a0 Still, it is rare for a pontiff to so directly critique a country's internal political debate.",
      "The pope also rejected Vice President JD Vance's use of Catholic theology to justify the immigration crackdown.",
      "In a January 29 appearance on Fox News, Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, described what he said was \"a very Christian concept: You love your family, and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country. And then after that, you can focus and prioritize the rest of the world.\"",
      "When critics responded that he had misunderstood the gospel, Vance took to social media to argue that a person's moral duties to their own children outweigh those, \"to a stranger who lives thousands of miles away.\"",
      "\"Just google 'ordo amoris,' Vance wrote, referring to a medieval Catholic concept on the \"order of love\" or \"order of charity\" to God, ourselves and our neighbors.",
      "While not mentioning Vance directly, Pope Francis directly contradicted the vice president's interpretation of Christian love in his Tuesday letter.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Francis also urged Catholics and others to, \"not give in to narratives that discriminate and cause needless suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.\"",
      "He said all nations' laws and policies should be crafted and considered, \"in light of the dignity of the person and his or her fundamental rights, and not vice versa.\"",
      "The pope and Mr. Trump have clashed on immigration in the past.",
      "In February 2016, asked about Mr. Trump's vow to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, Francis said, \"building walls instead of bridges is not Christian.\"",
      "In January, Francis called Mr. Trump's plan to conduct mass deportations of undocumented migrants a \"disgrace.\"",
      "\"It will be a disgrace,\" he said in an interview with an Italian talk show, \"because it makes the poor wretches who have nothing pay the bill\u2026 This won't do! You don't resolve things this way.\"",

    "summary": "Fear over the fate of the Gaza ceasefire spreads across the Mideast as Hamas delays the next release of Israeli hostages, Trump suggests a major change in terms.",
    "story": [
      "Families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza blocked traffic in Tel Aviv on Monday evening, panicked by Hamas saying it would delay the next scheduled release of hostages under the fragile ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to end the truce if the hostages are not returned by Saturday.",
      "\"If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end, and the IDF (Israeli military) will resume intense fighting until Hamas is decisively defeated,\" Netanyahu said in a statement after a meeting with his security cabinet.",
      "Fear over the durability of the ceasefire and hostage release agreement was spreading fast on Tuesday, after President Trump suggested the terms of the deal should be changed in the wake of Hamas' threat, and as Israel's Defense chief said he was readying troops in Gaza for a possible return to combat.",
      "The delicate halt in fighting, negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, has seen five exchanges between Israel and Hamas thus far, with about half of the 33 Israeli hostages expected to be freed during the first six-week phase of the agreement now back home. More than 700 Palestinian prisoners have been released from Israeli jails in exchange.",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, a total of 33 hostages were to be released during the first six-week phase, in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. But the families of the remaining 76 hostages \u2014 some of whom are already known to be dead \u2014 were left distraught by the developments on Monday, and by some devastating news confirmed later.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces announced Tuesday that the oldest of the remaining captives, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered in captivity. He was a survivor of the 1941 pogrom in Iraq, in which hundreds were killed in an antisemitic riot.",
      "It was with the last hostage release by Hamas, of three Israeli men on February 8, that the tone changed.",
      "Israelis were left in anguish after seeing the emaciated state the men were in, and Netanyahu's office said in a statement that, \"due to the serious condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations by the Hamas terrorist organization,\" the leader had \"instructed to not allow the situation to go unaddressed, and to take appropriate measures.\"",
      "There was no indication from Netanyahu's office over the weekend what those measures might be, but on Sunday, the IDF said in a statement that troops had \"operated to distance suspects who posed a threat to them in different areas of the Gaza Strip,\" including warning shots fired at a \"suspicious vessel\" seen offshore and a suspect seen approaching troops in the south of the enclave.",
      "The men released on Saturday, meanwhile, brought with them both welcome news, and some more distressing information. The family of hostage Alon Ohel learned that he is still alive, but that he's starving, with untreated wounds and bound in chains, according to his mother.",
      "\"Thank you for the effort you and your staff are making to bring back the hostages,\" Idit Ohel said, addressing Mr. Trump on Monday. \"Today is Alon's 24th birthday. I'm asking you with all my heart, do everything in your power to ensure that this deal is continued.\"",
      "The ceasefire agreement has also seen Israel allow hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians return to what's left of their homes in the decimated north of Gaza. But many now fear the respite could be short-lived.",
      "\"People have begun to stock up on supplies for fear that war will return,\" said Mohammad Yusuf, who lives in the badly scarred southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"People are afraid of any statement, from both sides.\"",
      "That fear is taking hold not just in Gaza, but in the other, much larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Residents there are already reeling from an Israeli operation to uproot Hamas that the military and police launched just several days after the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect. Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the territory has also been on the rise.",
      "Residents told CBS News this week that they fear President Trump's controversial plan to resettle all of Gaza's residents in other countries and \"take over\" the coastal strip of land is only the beginning.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, his election win had already fueled discussion in Israel of the prospect of the complete annexation of the West Bank as Israeli territory.",

      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",

      "The global average remained unchanged from 2023 at 43, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring under 50, Transparency International said. Denmark held onto first place with an unchanged 90 points, followed by Finland with 88 and Singapore with 84. New Zealand dropped from third to fourth, shedding two points to 83.",
      "South Sudan slid to the bottom of the index with just eight points, displacing Somalia although the latter country's score dropped to nine. They were followed by Venezuela with 10 and Syria with 12.",
      "The U.S. slid from 69 points to 65 and from 24th place to 28th. Transparency International pointed to criticism of its judicial branch. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 but \"serious questions remain about the lack of meaningful, objective enforcement mechanisms and the strength of the new rules themselves.\"",
      "Other Western nations on the decline included France, which dropped four points to 67 and five places to 25th; and Germany, down three points to 75 and six places to 15th. It tied with Canada, which was down one point and three places.",

      "In Europe, Slovakia dropped five points to 49 in the first full year of Prime Minister Robert Fico's government, \"as numerous reforms erode anti-corruption checks and bypass public consultation.\"",
      "Russia, which already declined significantly in recent years, shed another four points to 22 last year. Transparency International noted that Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has \"further entrenched authoritarianism.\" It said Ukraine, while its score dipped one point to 35, \"is making strides in judicial independence and high-level corruption prosecutions.\"",
      "In the Middle East and North Africa, the situation with anti-corruption efforts \"remains bleak\" as political leaders exert near-absolute control while benefiting from wealth and clamping down on dissent, the group said. But it said \"unforeseen opportunities are also emerging\" \u2014 for example, in the wake of the fall of President Bashar Assad's government in Syria. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest average score of any region, at 33.",

Under the terms of the ceasefire deal negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, a total of 33 Israeli hostages were to be released during a six-week first phase, in exchange for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.",
      "As of Monday, about three weeks into phase-one, about half of the hostages due to be released have thus far been freed, in line with the schedule laid out in the agreement.

      "Mr. Trump made the comments about the hostages while signing executive orders on Monday at the White House.

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 04:00:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Justin Baldoni claimed Blake Lively &quot;never intended&quot; to sue him in an amended lawsuit published on his public website countering &quot;It Ends With Us&quot; allegations.",
    "story": [
      "Criminal defense attorney Lexie Rigden joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the latest on the legal saga between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni.",
      "Justin Baldoni alleges Blake Lively's intentions in filing a civil rights complaint instead of a lawsuit \"were deliberate.\"",
      "Lively, 37, initially filed a complaint against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department Dec. 21, accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment while working on \"It Ends With Us.\" She also claimed that after raising concerns, he, along with a crisis PR team, orchestrated a retaliation campaign aimed at ruining her career.",
      "Baldoni, 41, launched a website that included an amended version of his $400 million defamation lawsuit against his co-star and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, which included an updated suit and timeline of events to counter claims she was sexually harassed on set of the drama for which he served as director.",
      "BLAKE LIVELY VS. JUSTIN BALDONI: EVERYTHING TO KNOW",
      "Justin Baldoni claimed Blake Lively \"never intended\" to file a lawsuit against him. (Getty Images)",
      "In his amended lawsuit, Baldoni claimed, \"Lively never intended to file a civil lawsuit, which would have triggered the Wayfarer Parties\u2019 right to discovery, including obtaining evidence and deposing Lively under oath. By the time Lively actually filed a lawsuit against the Wayfarer Parties, the damage to the Wayfarer Parties was done by virtue of Lively\u2019s months of colluding with the New York Times on a false and malicious narrative unshielded by any privilege. Make no mistake: these actions were deliberate.\"",
      "Celebrity attorney Christopher C. Melcher exclusively told Fox News Digital Baldoni had \"a very good reason\" to make the claim that Lively's actions were intentional.",
      "\"Because it was just a request for the government to investigate and not a lawsuit against Baldoni, he had no right to subpoena witnesses or force Blake or Ryan to sit for a deposition,\" Melcher said. \"The suspicion is that she leaked this request for investigation to the media with all of these text messages on there so that she could garner public sympathy but not be exposed to any scrutiny for her allegations.\"",
      "JOHNNY DEPP'S ATTORNEY WARNS BLAKE LIVELY, JUSTIN BALDONI FACE \u2018REAL DANGER\u2019 IN UPCOMING TRIAL",
      "Months after speculation of on-set issues between Baldoni and Lively, the \"Gossip Girl\" actress filed a complaint Dec. 21, making allegations of sexual harassment, retaliation, intentional affliction of emotional distress, negligence and more.",
      "Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni in December after rumors of an on-set feud on \"It Ends With Us.\" (Jose Perez/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)",
      "Melcher specified the importance of Baldoni stating Lively \"never intended to file a civil lawsuit\" in his amended lawsuit shared online.",
      "\"Ordinarily, if somebody makes a false statement against somebody, it's defamation, and you can get sued,\" Melcher said. \"But if the statement is made in a lawsuit or in contemplation of an immediate suit being filed, it is protected under the litigation privilege \u2013 that's Civil Code, Section 47.",
      "\"So, California Civil Code, Section 47 says statements made by a party in the course of a lawsuit are not defamatory, they're not actionable. You can't sue for defamation. And that's been interpreted to mean, 'OK, well, literally, if you're filing tomorrow, and you're maybe given a press release or demand letter, you can be covered under that umbrella that has to be immediately contemplated.'",
      "\"So, this \u2018never intended\u2019 is the code word for him saying that the leaks to the press are not covered by this litigation privilege because they were not made in the context of a lawsuit, and so that's what gives him the right to sue. Otherwise, he would be blocked.\"",

      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (See the video at the top of this article, and more videos at https://www.youtube.com/@nicknorwitzPhD.)",
      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",
      "\"I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated.\"",
      "\"Participants who consumed more red meat had a higher prevalence of current smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes, and lower levels of dietary quality education, socioeconomic status and physical activity,\" Norwitz says in the video.",
      "Actually, he adds, \"unprocessed red meat intake was not linked to dementia or cognitive decline \u2014 just processed red meat intake, but this was somewhat overlooked in the study itself.\"",
      "Myth No. 8: The carnivore diet is for everyone",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\"",
      "The diet warrants \"further scientific exploration,\" Norwitz said.",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, although he noted the carnivore diet is \"misunderstood\" and \"unfairly scapegoated.\" (iStock)",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, adding that \"context and nuance are essential.\"",
      "\"However, I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated and thrown under the \u2018big food bus.\u2019\"",
      "Doctors give insight into the carnivore diet",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, shared thoughts on the carnivore diet with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The advantage is that meat is a high-packed source of calories from fat and a lot of protein, so it can help you lose weight,\" he said. \"But I think it is unhealthy. Too many saturated animal fats are bad for the heart and the diet is high in cholesterol.\"",

      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "\"The hypothesis that meat is dangerous to human health has driven a long and passionate hunt for evidence against meat that has thus far come up empty-handed,\" the doctor, who is also the author of \"Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind,\" told Fox News Digital.",

      "Studies have shown that only one in eight Americans has optimal metabolic health, which Malhotra defines as \"the state of balance the body maintains between storing fat and burning it for energy.\"",
      "What drives metabolic health?",
      "In his bestselling book, \"The 21-Day Immunity Plan,\" Malhotra writes that metabolic health is measured using five markers.",
      "Those include blood glucose levels, blood pressure, waist circumference, cholesterol profile (the body's levels of triglycerides, a type of harmful fat found in the blood), and high-density lipoprotein (a beneficial cholesterol-carrying molecule).",
      "'GOD-INTENDED FOODS' ARE KEY TO A HEALTHIER AMERICA, EXPERT SAYS",
      "\"A person is considered to have metabolic syndrome when they fail to meet three of these optimal values,\" he writes. \"For example, someone who has high blood pressure, high blood glucose and high triglycerides would be considered to be at the highest risk of experiencing health problems.\"",
      "Poor metabolic health is directly linked to the development of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke, Malhotra cautioned.",

      "It also puts people at a higher risk of cancer and dementia, as well as complications from infections.",
      "The worst things someone can do for their metabolic health, Malhotra said, is to eat a diet high in ultraprocessed foods, sugar and other low-quality carbohydrates, such as flour-based products, rice and pasta.",
      "More than 133 million Americans (40%) had at least one chronic disease in 2022.",

      "Make it difficult for a romance scammer to target you",
      "Your personal information is a scammer\u2019s best tool. This includes your phone number, email and other contact details that allow them to reach you, as well as information like the celebrities you follow, your family members and even the type of content you engage with online to tailor the perfect attack. As scams become more sophisticated and reliant on loads of data, it\u2019s more important than ever to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal information.",
      "1. Vigilance in online dating: In the digital world, not everyone is who they claim to be. Be wary of potential romantic interests who ask for money or gifts or those who want to move the relationship along too quickly. Keep your personal and financial information private and never share it with someone you haven't met in person.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Verify the identity: Request additional information or proof to verify their identity, such as video chatting or meeting in person if possible. Exercise caution before getting emotionally invested in someone you haven't met in real life.",
      "3. Research and verify: Conduct an online search using the person's name, email address or phone number to see if any suspicious or fraudulent activities are associated with them.\u00a0Reverse image search their profile pictures to check if they are stolen from elsewhere on the internet. You can also reverse-search their phone number for free by following the instructions found\u00a0here.",
      "4. Privacy settings: Keep your social media profiles private so only those you trust can see what\u2019s going on in your life.",
      "5. Limit sharing: Adjust the privacy settings on all of your online accounts and apps to limit data collection and sharing.",
      "6. Use reputable dating platforms: Stick to well-known and reputable dating websites or apps with security measures to help protect their users from scams. These platforms often have guidelines for safe online dating and report suspicious users.",
      "7. Invest in personal information removal services:\u00a0I highly recommend you remove your personal information that can be found on various people search sites across the web. If you give someone your email address or phone number, they could potentially reverse-search your information and get your home address.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "SpaceX's Starship exploded during an unmanned test flight. Debris from the explosion streaked through the sky, leaving people on the ground amazed and confused. (Greg Munch /TMX)",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",

      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",

They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",

      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",

The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number.

      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",

If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "The ticket that might not be a ticket",
      "First things first, not all \"tickets\" are created equal. If you receive something that looks like a ticket but doesn't have the court's full address or phone number \u2013 or worse, it says \"Do not contact the court\" \u2013 you might be dealing with what's cheekily called a \"snitch ticket.\" These aren't real tickets at all but rather attempts to get you to rat out whoever was actually driving. The dead giveaway is usually that they will say something like, \"Courtesy Notice: This is not a ticket.\"",

      "BEWARE OF FAKE PARKING TICKETS ON YOUR WINDSHIELD WITH FAKE FINES",
      "Why are they playing this game?",
      "Because cities often have to pay camera vendors for every ticket issued, whether or not they ever collect a dime. So, when the footage is too blurry to ID the driver, they toss out these \"Whoops, was this you?\" tickets, hoping you\u2019ll do their homework for them. It\u2019s basically a shady game of\u00a0\"Guess Who?\" except you never agreed to play, the rules are rigged and the only prize is an unwanted fine.",

      "Ignore it: Since it's not a real ticket, you're not legally obligated to respond. Many people simply disregard these notices.",
      "Don't identify the driver: Remember, you're under no legal obligation to name who was driving your car.",
      "Check for red flags: Confirm it's a fake by looking for missing court information or the phrase \"Do not contact the court regarding this notice.\"",
      "Stay informed: Keep the notice for your records, but don't let it stress you out. It's not a legal document.",
      "Remember, these fake tickets are just fishing expeditions. You're well within your rights to toss them in the recycling bin and go about your day.",

      "If you receive a genuine ticket (one with all the court info) but you weren't the driver, you've got options.",
      "1) Contact the police (optional): You can try calling the number on the ticket and explaining the situation. But beware, they might pressure you to identify the actual driver.",
      "2) Stand your ground: Remember, you're not legally required to identify the driver. It's not your job to play detective for them.",
      "3) Go to court: If push comes to shove, you can always contest the ticket in court. Just be prepared for some potential pushback.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dealing with red light camera tickets can feel like navigating a legal minefield. The key is to know your rights, stand firm and don't let anyone pressure you into admitting guilt or identifying others if you're not comfortable doing so. Remember, the burden of proof is on them, not you. Stay informed, stay calm, and if all else fails, seek legal advice. After all, justice shouldn't be a game of \"gotcha.\"",

They make money by collecting data about you and me and selling targeted advertising to companies, which then show us products relevant to our interests.",

For example, Uber stores your location data to help you find a ride faster, while WhatsApp requires access to your contacts so you can send messages.",
      "The real issue is data collection that serves no purpose other than showing you ads or selling your information to third parties. According to Marin Marin\u010di\u0107, head of IT Infrastructure at\u00a0Nsoft, the top 20 most invasive apps collect data that is not necessary for their core functions.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Leading the list is Meta with all four of its major apps. Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and Threads share 68% of collected data with third parties while also using it for targeted ads. LinkedIn follows, sharing around 37% of user data, with Amazon in third place, followed by YouTube.",
      "What makes this concerning is how deeply embedded these apps are in our daily lives, making it nearly impossible to find alternatives or avoid data collection altogether.",
      "The list also includes Elon Musk\u2019s X at No. 5, followed by Uber Eats, PayPal, Uber, Google and Amazon Prime Video. TikTok, despite ongoing scrutiny over its data policies, ranks 14th. While many of these names were expected, one surprising entry is the mobile game Candy Crush, which uses 28% of collected data for ads. You can find the full list in the image below.",

      "If you\u2019re not able to delete the apps listed above, follow the simple steps below to minimize how much information is being collected and shared.",
      "1. Review app permissions:\u00a0Most apps request access to data they do not actually need. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. Disable access to location, microphone, contacts and other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.",
      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",
      "While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",

      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone. Many apps request unnecessary permissions that can track your activity, so deleting them limits exposure. Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",

While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

      "Solar Gate window facade system (Conn\u00e9 van d'Grachten)",
      "Nature's ingenious design",
      "Pine cones have these amazing scales that respond to moisture. When it's damp, they close up tight. But when it's warm and dry, they open wide to release their seeds. This simple yet effective mechanism has inspired scientists to develop a smart window system that could change the way we think about energy efficiency in buildings.",

      "SOLAR DEVICE TRANSFORMS USED TIRES TO HELP PURIFY WATER SO THAT ITS DRINKABLE",
      "The Solar Gate window system",
      "Scientists from Germany's universities of Stuttgart and Freiburg have developed what is known as the\u00a0Solar Gate window facade system. It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home. But when it's hot and dry, they flatten out to block the sun and keep things cool inside.",
      "Solar Gate window facade system (ICD/IntCDC University of Stuttgart)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",
      "The Solar Gate system consists of a gridded array of pine-cone-scale-inspired self-bending elements housed between two panes of glass in an aluminum-frame window unit. Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

      "SOLAR-POWERED BLIMP COULD BRING HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO YOUR AREA",
      "Real-world testing",
      "The Solar Gate system underwent rigorous real-world testing to prove its effectiveness. In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

For instance, studies have investigated the development of shading systems using wooden slats that can open and close in response to environmental conditions.",
      "In the realm of textiles, scientists are working on \"smart\" clothing fabrics that can adapt to ambient temperature, providing optimal comfort for wearers. Perhaps most intriguingly, these principles are even being applied to the field of robotics, with researchers developing tiny mobile robots that can respond to environmental stimuli in ways inspired by natural mechanisms.

      "\"Reasoned decision-making under the Administrative Procedure Act calls for an explanation for agency action. What was provided here was more of a distraction,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote then.",
      "A year later, the court ruled that the administration had failed to consider various factors when it sought to unwind the Obama administration policy that protects \"Dreamers\" from deportation. Its actions were \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the APA, Roberts wrote.",
      "On both issues, Trump administration officials \"were sloppy, and the court did not like that,\" said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law.",
      "He noted, however, that at this early stage, the administration could still fix at least some of its errors. In Trump's first term, for example, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld a revised version of a travel ban on people entering the country from mostly Muslim-majority countries after a more sweeping policy was pared back.",
      "\"The fact they're sloppy out of the gate, I don't think that tells us how the courts will ultimately resolve it,\" Adler said.",
      "Trump is by no means the only president to have fallen afoul of the APA, which judges routinely cite in striking down federal agency actions on a wide variety of issues, including environmental and consumer regulations that agencies sometimes spend years reviewing.",
      "In a high-profile case during the Biden administration, a federal judge in Texas threw out an immigration enforcement policy that would have prioritized deporting violent criminals.",
      "Among other things, District Judge Drew Tipton found that the administration had failed to take into account evidence about the dangers of recidivism and abscondment among immigrants with criminal records that undermined its policy conclusions.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 23:02:01 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was signing an executive order to give tech billionaire Elon Musk more power over the federal workforce, adding to Musk's swift and sweeping consolidation of political influence.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he was signing an executive order to give tech billionaire Elon Musk more power over the federal workforce, adding to Musk's swift and sweeping consolidation of political influence.",
      "With Musk standing to his right in the Oval Office, Trump praised the work of his office, known as the Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE). And Trump said he wanted Musk to now do more, even as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits from labor unions and Democratic state attorneys general over whether it is acting within the law.",
      "The new executive order directs federal agencies to \"coordinate and consult\" with DOGE to cut jobs and limit hiring, according to a summary provided by the White House. Each agency will be ordered to \"undertake plans for large-scale reductions in force\" and limit hiring to only \"essential positions,\" the summary says.",
      "Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the wealthiest person in the world, is wielding federal authority without giving up his private-sector jobs while also serving as a \"special government employee.\" It is a temporary position that bypasses some of the disclosure obligations required of full-time government employees.",
      "He wore an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" hat and had one of his 11 children underfoot for the briefing.",
      "Trump and Musk took questions from reporters in a freewheeling exchange for more than half an hour, but the two spoke mostly in generalities and did not give details about the alleged fraud they said DOGE had found.",
      "For weeks, Musk has railed against what he says is waste, fraud or abuse that DOGE has identified, although many of the examples he has posted about on social media lack specifics. On Monday, the DOGE account on X said the administration had terminated 89 contracts worth $881 million, but it did not say what they were or why they counted as waste.",
      "In other instances, independent fact-checkers have cast doubt on Musk\u2019s examples of alleged waste. His claim that the United States spent $50 million on condoms for the Gaza Strip was widely criticized for lacking evidence.",
      "Asked by a reporter about the condom fact-checks, Musk acknowledged that some of what he has said about alleged waste in the government has turned out to be false.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s going to bat a thousand,\u201d Musk said. (Earlier in the day, Musk had been posting phallic jokes on X.)",
      "Musk also said he had worked with Secretary of State Marco Rubio to \u201cturn on funding\u201d for Ebola and HIV prevention, making them exceptions to his attempt at an overall spending freeze. He said pausing that funding had been a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will make mistakes, but we also fix the mistakes very quickly,\u201d he said.",
      "The two said little to calm concerns that they were violating the Constitution, including by trying to shutter federal agencies without the approval of Congress and refusing to spend money that Congress had appropriated. Among DOGE\u2019s targets for elimination are the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Education Department.",
      "In response to a reporter's question, Musk said it was not a conflict of interest for him to intervene in the operations of the Defense Department, for which SpaceX is a major contractor. He said he delegates the relevant work at SpaceX.\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not the one filing the contract. It\u2019s people at SpaceX,\u201d he said. And he added: \u201cIf you see any contract where the where it was awarded to SpaceX and it wasn\u2019t by far the best value for money for the taxpayer, let me know, because every one of them was.\u201d",
      "SpaceX had $3.8 billion in federal contracts last year, according to government data.",
      "Trump brushed aside a reporter\u2019s question about whether he would eventually need congressional approval to cut spending.",
      "\"I really don't know,\" he said. \"If I need a vote of Congress to find fraud and abuse, it's fine with me. I think we'll get the vote.\"",
      "Trump also attacked a federal judge in New York who granted a temporary restraining order Saturday related to DOGE's activity in the Treasury Department. He called the judge an \"activist.\"",
      "But he said in response to a later question that he would abide by any adverse court rulings.",
      "\"I always abide by the courts \u2014 always abide by them \u2014 and will appeal,\" he said.",
      "In the three weeks since Trump took office, plaintiffs have filed 52 lawsuits over his executive orders and other administrative actions, including DOGE\u2019s activity, according to a database maintained by Just Security, a legal publication based at New York University.",
      "The image of Trump and Musk taking questions side-by-side appeared to put to rest any doubts over whether Musk had Trump\u2019s support for his expansive overhaul proposals. And the latest executive order appeared to be aimed at expanding the scope of Musk's influence.",
      "Trump did not sign the DOGE-related executive order in the presence of reporters, but the White House said later that he had signed it.",
      "There are about 2.4 million federal employees, excluding postal workers, according to the Pew Research Center. The number has grown by a little over 1% per year since 2000, but as a share of all civilian employment it has changed little, Pew said in a report last month.",
      "Even if DOGE succeeds at cutting the federal workforce by a substantial number, their compensation makes up a small percentage of the overall budget \u2014 about 6.6%, according to the Brookings Institution. The vast majority of federal spending goes toward Social Security; health care for the elderly, disabled and poor; the military; and interest on the national debt, the Congressional Budget Office says.",
      "Musk and Trump mentioned the words \u201cwaste,\u201d \u201cfraud\u201d or \u201cabuse\u201d dozens of times in the 30-plus minutes they spoke with reporters, but details were few and far between. Trump said an unspecified man had been given a federal contract for three months but was paid for 20 years, a story for which he provided no evidence. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for more information.",
      "Several long-standing government offices were already devoted to finding waste, fraud and abuse before DOGE was created. They include the Government Accountability Office and the inspectors general for individual departments.",
      "Musk said that DOGE has been looking into the net worth of some federal employees and that he considered a high net worth a sign of potential fraud for a government worker.",
      "\"There are quite a few people in the bureaucracy who have ostensibly a salary of a few hundred thousand dollars but somehow managed to accrue tens of millions of dollars in net worth,\" he said. \"We're just curious as to where it came from.\"",
      "Musk did not say how DOGE had acquired data about federal employees' net worth, and White House spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for more information about his comments."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Emil Bove, the acting DOJ official behind a potential witch hunt against prosecutors and FBI agents who investigated the Capitol riot, worked on Jan. 6 cases himself",
    "story": [
      "In the months after the Jan. 6\u00a0attacks, a hard-charging federal prosecutor in Manhattan eagerly oversaw efforts to find and arrest Capitol rioters in the New York area, his former colleagues say, and even proposed to the Justice Department that his office should\u00a0play a central role in\u00a0the investigation.",
      "His name: Emil Bove.",
      "Bove, whose prominence soared when he was one of Donald Trump\u2019s defense lawyers last year, is now the Trump-appointed acting deputy attorney general, essentially the chief operating officer of the Justice Department.",
      "He has been leading an effort to identify everyone who worked on Jan. 6\u00a0cases and remedy what Trump called \u201ca grave national injustice\u201d by rooting out \u201cthose who acted with corrupt or partisan intent\u201d when they investigated Trump and Capitol rioters.",
      "Some who know Bove have been shocked by the turnabout. On Jan. 6, 2021, Bove was helping lead the counterterrorism section in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan when a pro-Trump mob attacked the U.S. Capitol. Over the next several months, he worked closely with FBI agents as they hunted down suspects in the New York area.",
      "Two former colleagues who worked alongside Bove on Jan. 6\u00a0cases in New York say they never heard him express qualms about the sprawling Capitol riot criminal investigation, which grew into the largest in American history.",
      "\u201cHe treated these cases as a priority,\u201d said Christopher O\u2019Leary, who sat in meetings with Bove as a senior FBI counterterrorism agent. \u201cIn my daily interactions with him, there was never any indication of anything other than full-throated support.\u201d",
      "Bove is set to become the deputy to his former law partner Todd Blanche, who has been nominated to fill the job Bove now holds, deputy attorney general.",
      "Through a Justice Department spokesman, Bove declined to answer questions for this article.",
      "Weekly Jan. 6\u00a0meetings",
      "O\u2019Leary and a former senior Justice Department prosecutor\u00a0who asked not to be named\u00a0while discussing internal matters said Bove attended weekly morning meetings about Jan. 6\u00a0cases chaired by the senior FBI official in New York.",
      "The group of prosecutors and law enforcement agents planned and prioritized efforts to find and arrest Jan. 6\u00a0defendants, based on intelligence coming in from around the country.",
      "\u201cEmil gave very clear direction to aggressively work to support FBI\u2019s effort to write warrants, pen registers, etc.,\u201d the former prosecutor told NBC News, referring to an FBI technology that records incoming phone numbers.",
      "He said Bove even \u201cmade a push with our leadership counterparts at NSD\u201d \u2014 the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division in Washington \u2014 to play a leading role in the response to Jan. 6, the former prosecutor said. \u201cThe idea was we have the counterterrorism expertise, we should run this.\u201d",
      "In the end, that job fell to the U.S. attorney in Washington and the FBI field office there. But federal prosecutors and FBI agents in New York continued to search for Jan. 6\u00a0defendants.",
      "They included Samuel Fisher, a Capitol rioter who was arrested in Manhattan two weeks after the attack with a thousand rounds of ammunition and several weapons. He was sentenced to 3\u00bd years on the weapons charges, but a Trump pardon erased his Jan. 6\u00a0guilty plea.",
      "\u201cEmil was up half the night preparing for that arrest,\u201d the former prosecutor said.",
      "The second Trump administration",
      "Since Trump took office last month, Bove has been the face of the effort to demand that the FBI hand over the names of every bureau employee who worked on Jan. 6\u00a0cases.",
      "\u201cThe FBI \u2014 including the Bureau\u2019s prior leadership \u2014 actively participated in what President Trump appropriately described as \u2018a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated on the American people over the last four years\u2019 with respect to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u201d Bove wrote in a memo to FBI leadership demanding a list of all FBI employees who had investigated the riot.",
      "Bove omitted that he, too, had investigated Jan. 6\u00a0cases.",
      "Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, who noted that he and thousands of other FBI personnel would be on that list, initially resisted providing the names to Bove, instead turning over employee ID numbers.\u00a0Bove called that \u201cinsubordination\u201d in another memo and later ordered Driscoll to provide the names, which he did. FBI agents on the list say they fear they will be fired or demoted.",
      "A sprawling investigation",
      "The Justice Department under Merrick Garland made a priority of trying to prosecute everyone who illegally entered the Capitol because, as Garland repeatedly said,\u00a0he and other top officials\u00a0considered what happened an attack on American democracy.",
      "After the\u00a0number of estimated illegal entrants to the Capitol \u2014 initially thought to be around 800 \u2014 ballooned to more than 3,500, some defense lawyers and former Justice Department officials criticized the broad undertaking as overzealous.\u00a0They argued that prosecutors should have focused on those who committed violence.",
      "As the years passed, some FBI agents and prosecutors across the country also privately questioned the use of resources on minor figures, some have told NBC News, even as they supported efforts to hold ringleaders and people who violently attacked police officers accountable.",
      "Prosecutors who worked on the investigation say the lines they drew \u2014 focusing on charging those who either entered the Capitol itself or committed acts of violence or property destruction outside it \u2014 were a reasonable use of prosecutorial discretion.",
      "Matthew Graves, the former U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., who oversaw the investigation, has pointed out that the government theoretically could have charged anyone it could prove knowingly entered the restricted area outside the Capitol.",
      "Many prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6\u00a0cases see the questions about whether they should have narrowed their focus in the early days as Monday morning quarterbacking. They say they operated with the best information they had at the time. Moreover, they point out that the broad parameters of the investigation were set out in the early days of the investigation by a Trump administration-appointed U.S. attorney.",
      "If Bove felt\u00a0the Justice Department was overreaching, he never mentioned it at the many meetings devoted to pursuing Jan. 6\u00a0defendants, O\u2019Leary and the former prosecutor\u00a0who worked with Bove\u00a0say.",
      "No credible evidence has publicly emerged that any FBI agent or federal prosecutor did anything improper in the estimated 2,400 Jan. 6\u00a0investigations.\u00a0The vast majority of criminal charges resulted in guilty pleas or convictions \u2014 a process under which defense attorneys would have a chance to present any evidence of misconduct.",
      "But that hasn\u2019t stopped Trump and his allies from portraying all of the investigations as politically motivated.\u00a0Trump\u2019s pardoning of all the Jan. 6 defendants, including those who assaulted police officers, on his first day back in office hasn\u2019t stopped calls for vengeance against law enforcement officials.",
      "Former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, whom Trump\u2019s pardon freed from a 22-year prison sentence for sedition, told USA Today that he wanted criminal investigations of the FBI agents and lawyers who brought the cases.",
      "\u201cWhen I say, \u2018Feel the heat,\u2019 I want to be clear that I want investigations,\u201d Tarrio said.",
      "Bove\u2019s firsthand experience",
      "Jason Manning, a former federal prosecutor who worked Jan. 6 cases, told NBC News that Bove\u2019s firsthand experience with Jan. 6\u00a0cases would have assured him there was no \u201cnational mischarge of justice,\u201d as Trump has claimed.",
      "Manning said it was surprising that Bove would be involved in an effort to gather a list of people at the FBI who worked Jan. 6 cases and to fire some federal prosecutors who were in the former Capitol Siege Section, since they would have been his colleagues.",
      "\u201cHe knows better,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIf he thought there was something improper about how they were being pursed, he had an obligation to say something.",
      "\u201cThose of us who worked on these cases firmly believe that the record stands,\u201d he added. \u201cThat record shows that hundreds of individuals were lawfully convicted based on overwhelming evidence. And according to the reporting, the record also shows that Emil Bove actively contributed to that effort. Mr. Bove can\u2019t change that record now.\u201d",
      "Alexis Loeb, a former senior Capitol riot prosecutor, said Bove\u2019s actions aren\u2019t what she would expect of a federal prosecutor who knew the details of Jan. 6 cases.",
      "\u201cI would be surprised how anyone who saw the facts of these cases up close could play a role in terminating some of the prosecutors involved,\u201d Loeb said. \u201cOr suggest that it was unethical to prosecute the massive number of assaults on police and attack on the Capitol.\u201d",
      "Another former federal prosecutor who worked Jan. 6 cases said Bove had \u201cjoined the administration\u2019s efforts in whitewashing the history of the attack on the Capitol\u201d and \u201cadopted the president\u2019s ridiculous recharacterization of history that the investigation into the riot was a \u2018grave national injustice,\u2019 despite that Bove was one of the individuals leading the charge in Manhattan during the investigation.\u201d",
      "A current law enforcement official said Bove\u2019s statements and actions since Trump took office last month had irrevocably and unfairly tarnished public trust in the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cThe amount of damage he has inflicted on the department in just three weeks is impossible to overstate,\u201d the official said. \u201cAssuming the department survives this, it will take a very long time to recover its legitimacy in the eyes of the public and its own career attorneys.\u201d",
      "Multiple FBI agents, many of whom were ordered to work on Jan. 6\u00a0cases, told NBC News they were worried that they might lose their jobs\u00a0because they obeyed orders.",
      "\u201cI was assigned to investigate a potential crime,\u201d an agent wrote. \u201cLike all previous cases I have investigated, this one met every legal standard of predication and procedure.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout bias, I upheld my oath to this country and the Constitution and collected the facts,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI am now sitting in my home, listening to my children play and laugh in the backyard, oblivious to the prospect that their father may be fired in a few days. Fired for conducting a legally authorized investigation. Fired for doing the job that he was hired to do.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee has sent a letter to the Justice Department Inspector General accusing Kash Patel, President Trump's pick for FBI director, of secretly orchestrating the firings of FBI officials, a day after telling the committee under oath that he was not aware of any plan to do so.",
      "\u201cIf these allegations are true, Mr. Patel may have perjured himself before the Senate Judiciary Committee,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote.",
      "Durbin said\u00a0he has spoken\u00a0to whistleblowers who\u00a0told him that\u00a0Patel has been\u00a0relaying\u00a0instructions to White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who then relayed Patel's instructions to acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.",
      "\u201cI have received highly credible information from multiple sources that Kash Patel has been personally directing the ongoing purge of career civil servants at the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u201d Durbin wrote in the letter. \u201cAlthough Mr. Patel is President Trump\u2019s nominee to be FBI Director, he is still a private citizen with no role in government.\u201d",
      "Durbin, whose letter was first reported by The New York Times, described a meeting the day before Patel's confirmation hearing where Bove said Patel and Miller were pushing for firings at the FBI, as had already occurred at the Department of Justice.",
      "\"Contemporaneous notes from that morning meeting read: 'KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ,'\u201d Durbin wrote, an apparent reference to Patel's initials.",
      "In a social media post, Erika Knight, a spokesperson for Patel, did not directly address Durbin's letter but decried what she described as a \"false narrative.\"",
      "\u201cKash Patel is a highly qualified national security expert who has been fully transparent with the American people throughout this process and has demonstrated the integrity and leadership needed for this role,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Senate should confirm him without delay.\u201d",
      "Durbin noted\u00a0that, during Patel's confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, Sen. Corey Booker, D-N.J.,  asked Patel if he was \"aware of any plans or discussions to punish in any way, including termination, FBI agents or personnel associated with Trump investigations? Yes or no.\u201d",
      "Patel answered that he was \u201cnot aware of that.\u201d\u00a0Patel then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on right now over there, but I\u2019m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues that I will honor the internal review process of the FBI.\u201d",
      "Patel also stated in the hearing, \u201cAll FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.\u201d",
      "The following day,\u00a0acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll sent a memo to the entire FBI workforce saying that he had been ordered to remove eight senior FBI executives by Bove, who previously worked as Trump's defense lawyer. Driscoll also said he was told to turn over the names of every FBI employee involved in investigating Jan. 6 rioters, a number believed to be in the thousands.",
      "Driscoll refused a Justice Department order that he assist in the firing of agents involved in Jan. 6 riot cases, pushing back so forcefully that some FBI officials feared he would be dismissed, multiple current and former FBI officials previously told NBC News.",
      "Continued fears of mass firings",
      "The Trump administration has also asked the FBI's field offices and headquarters to justify the continued employment of 3,600 bureau employees \u2014 roughly 10% of the FBI\u2019s workforce \u2014 who joined the bureau recently and as a result are on probationary status.",
      "The FBI Agents Association, a group that represents agents but is not a union, said that special agents on probation have already undergone extensive training at the FBI Academy in Quantico. They say the agents are already working on active investigations and mass dismissals could disrupt them.",
      "In an interview with NBC News Tuesday, Natalie Bara, the president of the FBI Agents Association, said that it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to train an agent, from their initial application to their graduation from Quantico.",
      "Bara said the bureau needs to add 800 to 1,000 special agents each year to replace retiring special agents, so mass firings would impact the bureau for years.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to turn around and fire or dismiss agents who have already been through this process,\" Bara said.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that it is \u201cunrealistic\u201d to aim for a return to Ukraine\u2019s borders as they were before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists who took over swaths of the country\u2019s east.",
      "The remarks are the clearest indication yet that the United States will support negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in which Ukraine cedes territory that\u2019s already been seized by the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine,\u201d Hegseth\u00a0said in a speech during a trip to NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. \u201cBut we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.\u201d",
      "\u201cChasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\u201d he told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at which Western allies discuss Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion. \u201cWe will only end this devastating war \u2014 and establish a durable peace \u2014 by coupling allied strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield.\u201d",
      "Hegseth\u2019s remarks put meat on the bone of Trump\u2019s radical departure from former President Joe Biden\u2019s policy. Whereas Biden focused on all-out Ukrainian victory, Trump says he wants to end the war as quickly as possible.",
      "The defense secretary is part of a high-level Trump team touring Europe this week, with allies eager to learn how this ambitious plan might come about. Many Ukrainians are hopeful of Trump\u2019s ability to end the conflict; others fear his negotiations will force them to accept unfavorable terms and embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Hegseth sought to allay these fears by saying that \u201ca durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war won\u2019t begin again.\u201d",
      "However, these guarantees should not include giving Ukraine NATO membership, as it has long desired, but instead have non-American troops \u201cdeployed as peacekeepers\u201d to the country, he said. These personnel should not be deployed as a NATO mission, or be covered by the alliance\u2019s Article 5 guarantee, under which allies agree to step in if any member is attacked, he added.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump will seek to pressure the Kremlin by \u201cunleashing American energy production\u201d and thus throttling Russian exports that fund its war machine, Hegseth said. But he made clear that European nations would be required to provide most of the military support for Ukraine \u2014 which is currently underwritten by Washington more than any other nation.",
      "He said he was in Brussels to \u201cdirectly and unambiguously express\u00a0that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being the primary guarantor of security in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must \u2014 and we are \u2014 focusing on securing our own borders.\u201d",

    "title": "DACA recipients worry about being ensnared in Trump's immigration crackdown",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 13:22:19 GMT",
    "summary": "With the president already ending various legal immigration programs and the fate of DACA remaining uncertain, Dreamers fear for their protections.",
    "story": [
      "DACA recipients are increasingly feeling more uncertainty as the fate of the immigration program protecting them from deportation continues to be challenged in court \u2014 at a time when President Donald Trump is pushing his administration to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history.\"",
      "Under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u00a0program, or DACA, eligible undocumented young adults who came to the United States as children have been allowed to work and study without fear of deportation since 2012, when an executive action by President Barack Obama created the program.",
      "DACA has been hanging by a thread for the past seven years as legal challenges from the first Trump administration and nine Republican-led states have made their way through the courts.",
      "Last month, an appeals court ruled against parts of the DACA program but allowed it to remain in effect for current beneficiaries as the case continues.",
      "With that court decision expected to be appealed and reach the Supreme Court \u2014 which could rule against the Obama-era program \u2014 DACA recipients worry the end of their protections could mean they could face deportation.",
      "The Trump administration has already ended a number of other immigration protections, including the CBP One app,\u00a0refugee programs\u00a0and\u00a0Temporary Protected Status \u2014 all of which allowed recent migrants and immigrants to remain in the United States legally as many sought asylum or adjustments to their immigration status.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s adding to a lot of the fear and worry,\u201d Anabel Mendoza, interim director of communications at United We Dream, the nation\u2019s largest immigrant youth-led network, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat continued uncertainty about what is going to happen in the courts always makes it so that\u00a0there\u2019s a sense of knowing that things can change overnight with DACA,\" Mendoza said.",
      "Protections \u2014 for now",
      "DACA recipients are still protected from deportation as long as they continue to renew their status on schedule, according to the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which has been representing DACA recipients in the legal challenges.",
      "As the Trump administration ramps up its immigration crackdown, beneficiaries who fail to renew their DACA status in a timely manner are left in particularly vulnerable positions by losing their protection against deportation.",
      "\u201cEven if you have DACA, that doesn\u2019t mean that you are off the table,\u201d Mendoza said, \u201cespecially when you have an administration that has been so vocal about the fact that they see anybody who is an undocumented immigrant, who came to this country undocumented, as having done wrong and as being a target.\u201d",
      "There was a renewed sense of fear among DACA recipients after a middle school teacher was deported to Honduras last month. The United Teachers of Dade union told NBC Miami that the teacher, 24, who was not identified by name, had protection under DACA. It\u2019s unclear whether the teacher had it when he was deported or whether it had expired, Mendoza said, adding that it is most likely one of the first deportation cases involving a DACA recipient in recent memory.",
      "That\u2019s why it's so important for DACA recipients to renew their status on time, Mendoza said. \u201cThey need to be continuing to renew and honestly renewing the sooner the better.\u201d",
      "What will Trump do?",
      "Polls and surveys have consistently shown that most U.S. adults favor granting permanent legal status and a pathway to citizenship to DACA recipients and \u201cDreamers,\u201d who are also undocumented young adults who came to the United States as children but were left out of the DACA program.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Trump said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in December that he wanted to work with Democrats and Republicans on a plan \u201cto do something about the Dreamers.\u201d",
      "High-profile Trump supporters like the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, an influential conservative Latino evangelical, seem to have taken such comments to mean the current Trump administration \u201cwill work on finding a solution for Dreamers\u201d if DACA is permanently terminated. In an interview last week, Rodriguez said he believes Trump will work to find \u201ca pathway to legalize\u201d Dreamers.",
      "But Mendez and other DACA supporters say they haven't yet gotten any indication that's what the administration plans to do.",
      "After all, the lengthy legal battle that has put DACA at risk started when Trump sought to end it in 2017, an effort the Supreme Court blocked in 2020.",
      "Many of the Republican-led states trying to terminate the program in federal court are in line with Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "Though the Trump administration has promised to prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records, immigration officials have said that any undocumented person may be arrested during enforcement actions.",
      "Building a life \u2014 and wanting 'to stay'",
      "DACA has been closed for new applicants since the legal challenges began, shutting out an\u00a0estimated 400,000 people\u00a0who could have benefited from it. But for about\u00a0580,000 existing DACA recipients\u00a0and their families, the future remains uncertain.",
      "Sandra Avalos, 36, was brought to the United States from Mexico in 1996, when she was 7 years old. She has called Texas her home ever since.",
      "A college graduate, a homeowner and a mother to a teenager, Avalos has made a career in the nonprofit sector, working with first-generation college students and immigrants. In 2015, the year she battled thyroid cancer, she applied for DACA.",
      "Avalos has been consistently renewing her DACA status for the past nine years. The protection, she said, has allowed her to build a career, have a driver's license and feel safe from deportation when she takes her son to school.",
      "\"I want to stay in this country,\" Avalos said. \"I want to see my kid go through with high school, finish, graduate and then go off to college. I want to be here for all of that.\"",
      "\"At this time,\" Avalos said, \"it's kind of difficult to see that there is an opportunity for us.\""

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 A Chinese animated film about a mythical child with a punk attitude and superpowers has become China\u2019s highest-grossing movie of all time, stoking national pride and potentially setting more records as it premieres overseas.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d has earned almost almost $1.3 billion in the two weeks since it was released in mainland China, according to the Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. In addition to being the most successful film in Chinese box office history, it is the first non-Hollywood film to earn more than $1 billion and the first film in the world to earn more than $1 billion in a single market.",
      "The movie is set for a limited release in the United States starting Friday.",
      "Inspired by a famous Chinese legend, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d tells the story of a child deity named Ne Zha who rebels against his destiny and uses magical powers to protect his community from formidable enemies. It\u2019s the sequel to a hit movie released in 2019 that became the highest-grossing Chinese animated film at the time.",
      "Chinese moviegoers have showered the new film with praise, taking pride in the fact that it is entirely Chinese-made, from the director to the special effects and postproduction teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a purely Chinese animated film, deeply rooted in Chinese cultural heritage,\u201d said Nianyi Zhao, 29, an independent film critic in China. \u201cRegardless of how the story is structured, Chinese audiences are willing to support it as a way of promoting domestic animation and sharing Chinese culture with the world.\u201d",
      "Its success has been hailed as a sign of China\u2019s advances in filmmaking and the declining influence of Hollywood in China amid a growing cultural and national identity.",
      "\u201cThe film masterfully blends traditional Eastern aesthetics \u2014 such as Dunhuang murals and ink painting \u2014 with modern animation technology,\u201d said Neo Liu, a 31-year-old illustration designer from Beijing. \u201cIt was an impressive visual experience.\u201d",
      "Jiaozi, also known as Yang Yu, who directed and wrote both \u201cNe Zha\u201d films, told Chinese state-run broadcaster CCTV\u00a0that he had tried to outsource key visual work to top overseas studios, but the results fell short due to \u201carrogance and prejudice.\u201d",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d \u2014 whose Jan. 29 release coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday, a major moviegoing period \u2014 has brought a glimmer of hope to China\u2019s languishing film market, whose total box office last year was 34% lower than its pre-Covid peak in 2019, according to data from the China Film Administration.",
      "The film helped the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after North America, take in a record 9.5 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) during the eight-day Lunar New Year holiday, according to Maoyan, in a bright spot for Chinese officials struggling to boost consumer spending amid an economic slump.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d quickly eclipsed China\u2019s previous highest-grossing film, 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Battle of Lake Changjin,\u201d a Korean War drama typical of the patriotic epics that have dominated the Chinese box office in recent years.",
      "It could also be on course to surpass last year\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the highest-grossing animated film of all time.",
      "Chinese state media have touted \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d as the latest in a series of Chinese cultural successes including last year\u2019s hit video game Black Myth: Wukong, the recent rush of American TikTok users to the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, and the market-moving rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek.",
      "\u201cThe reason these products from different fields have been able to break through visible or invisible barriers and create an international buzz lies in the strong demand for exchanges in trade, culture, and public opinion between China and the world,\u201d the state-backed nationalist tabloid Global Times said in an editorial on Wednesday.",
      "Asked Wednesday about the success of \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Chinese films \u201care building new bridges for communication between China and other countries, and opening up a new window for the world to understand China.\u201d",
      "The film has also connected with Chinese audiences who see the character of Ne Zha as an anti-hero whose \u201cfighting spirit\u201d against authority and hierarchy serves as a counterpoint to the popular concept of \u201clying flat,\u201d or doing the bare minimum to get by in life while rejecting the relentless economic pressure of Chinese society.",
      "\u201cThis movie is so inspiring,\u201d read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cWe young people are very easily defeated in life but maybe we should live passionately, just like Ne Zha.\u201d",
      "The fanfare continues to build, with movie merchandise flying off the shelves and the film projected to earn nearly $2 billion in China alone.",
      "On Weibo, a hashtag called #NeZhaBoxOfficeRaisingNationalFlag is quickly gaining traction with billions of views, and many young people have said they are willing to pay to watch the movie multiple times to help boost its ranking.",
      "Not everyone is so effusive about the film.",
      "\u201cCompared to other movies from the same period, I guess I like it \u2014but mostly because the local Chinese films in recent years have been pretty underwhelming,\u201d said Ginger Zhang, a 29-year-old in Beijing.",
      "Vanessa Huang, a 31-year-old working in law, said she liked the movie and planned to watch it again, but it was not without flaws.",
      "\u201cNe Zha\u00a0in the original story has a strong anti-patriarchal theme, which wasn\u2019t really reflected in the film,\u201d she said. \u201cBut overall, it\u2019s still a solid work.\u201d"

      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",
      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",
      "Among them is Ibrahim, a Moroccan national who admitted in an interview with NBC News late last month that he was an ISIS fighter but insisted that he was no longer a threat.",
      "\u201cIf I were dangerous, I would not have surrendered myself,\u201d said Ibrahim, who declined to give his last name. \u201cI just want to go back to my county.\u201d",

      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",

      "Since Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza began, more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed, with the majority of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population forcibly displaced, according to local officials.",
      "In Netanyahu's statement late Tuesday, his rhetoric echoed that of Trump, who on Monday demanded that Hamas free all remaining hostages \"by Saturday at 12 o\u2019clock.\" The president did not specify whether he meant midnight or midday.",
      "Trump doubled down on his position Tuesday following a meeting at the White House with Jordan's King Abdullah, reiterating his belief that Jordan and Egypt should take in Palestinians displaced from Gaza.",

      "\"He sends the message that he wants to be the man for peace and every act that he is doing points to exactly the opposite direction,\" he said, adding that the Israeli government should end \"all this pandering to President Trump\" at the risk of being \"complicit in war crimes and probably destabilizing the Middle East.\"",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t be very surprised if it breaks even before we get to the end of the first phase,\u201d he said, referring to the planned end of the ceasefire's initial stage slated for March 2.",

      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing the families of Israeli hostages, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cwe must not go backward. We cannot allow the hostages to waste away in captivity.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments have also drawn widespread condemnation from the broader Arab world.",
      "Speaking at a summit in Dubai on Wednesday, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said Trump\u2019s plans to take over Gaza would lead to a new cycle of crises. According to Reuters, he added that \u201cif the situation explodes militarily once more, all this effort will be wasted.\u201d",
      "Gheit also said the regional organization planned to reintroduce the Arab Peace Initiative, which was floated in 2002 to normalize ties with Israel in exchange for a statehood deal with Palestinians.",
      "Meanwhile, Egypt plans to host an emergency Arab summit Feb. 27 after Trump extended an open invitation to President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi\u00a0to discuss the matter the White House."

      "A satirical counter offer to President Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to buy Greenland has popped in the form of a petition which suggests that Denmark should buy California.",
      "More than 200,000 people have signed up for the plan which says that the Scandinavian country needs \u201cmore sunshine, palm trees, and roller skates.\u201d",
      "\u201cM\u00e5ke Calif\u00f8rnia Great \u00c6gain,\u201d reads the top of the petition website, replacing some English letters with Danish ones.",
      "Among the listed so-called \u201csupporters\u201d of the petition are the ancient Scandinavian king, Sven the Viking, Karen from accounting and Laris Ulrich, the Danish drummer and founding member of the band Metallica.",
      "\u201cImagine swapping your rain boots for flip-flops,\u201d the petition says, perhaps cogniscant of the fact that during the dark winter months Denmark gets just an hour of sunlight a day. By contrast, California gets 300 days of sunshine a year.",
      "As part of the buyout plan, the petition \u2014 launched on the website denmarkification.com \u2014 has set a crowdfunding goal of $1 trillion, \u201cgive or take a few billion,\u201d and the target of 500,000 signatures.",
      "Denmark's foreign ministry and  California Gov.\u00a0Gavin Newsom's office\u00a0did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.",
      "And at the bottom of the the petition's website, which does not mention Greenland, is a message reading, \u201cDisclaimer: This campaign is 100% real\u2026 in our dreams.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has considered buying Greenland at least twice, in 1867 and again in 1946, when President Harry S. Truman proposed purchasing it for $100 million.",
      "Trump has since suggested on multiple occassions that the U.S. should purchase Greenland, the largest island in the world which sits between the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean and is  technically part of North America although it has been under Denmark\u2019s control since the 14th century but it became a self-governing territory in 1979.",
      "Denmark has repeatedly rejected his overtures, insisting that Greenland is not for sale.",
      "Last week, the Danish parliament passed a bill that prevents political parties in the country from receiving foreign or anonymous contributions.",
      "The bill \u201cmust be seen in light of the geopolitical interests in Greenland and the current situation where representatives of an allied great power have expressed interest in taking over and controlling Greenland,\u201d the document said.",
      "While there has been a popular and longstanding movement calling for independence from Denmark in Greenland, most of the island\u2019s 56,000 inhabitants \u2014 the majority from Inuit tribes  \u2014 appear to agree that the island is not for sale.",
      "\u201cGreenland is for the Greenlandic people. We do not want to be Danish, we do not want to be American,\u201d the territory's Prime Minister M\u00fate B. Egede said last month.",
      "Whether Californians will be open to the petition\u2019s proposition that Denmark should own it remains to be seen, although it does  promise to send executives from the Danish toymaker Lego to secure the U.S. state, calling them the country\u2019s \u201cbestest negotiatiors.\u201d",
      "\u201cRule of law, universal health care and fact based politics might apply,\u201d the petition says. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring hygge to Hollywood, bike lanes to Beverly Hills, and organic sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d to every street corner.\u201d"

      "The department sent a letter to the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) \u00a0 calling on them to \u201crestore to female athletes the records, titles, awards, and recognitions misappropriated by biological males competing in female categories,\u201d according to a news release from the department.",

      "The NCAA\u2019s policy change came the day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week barring trans girls and women from competing in female sports. The order threatens to revoke federal funding from schools that don\u2019t comply. The order does not bar trans boys and men from playing on male sports teams, and the department\u2019s letter to the NCAA and NFHS does not mention reversing awards won by trans men.",
      "The Education Department\u2019s release Tuesday quoted Riley Gaines, a former swimmer for the University of Kentucky who now advocates against including trans women in women\u2019s sports. In 2022, Gaines, a 12-time NCAA All American, tied for fifth with Lia Thomas, a trans woman who swam for the University of Pennsylvania, in the women\u2019s 200-meter NCAA championships. That same year, Thomas became the first trans woman to win an NCAA championship when she won the 500-yard freestyle.",

Restoring stolen athletic accolades to their rightful owners is a crucial step towards reinstating accountability, integrity, and common sense \u2014 one that I wholeheartedly support.\u201d",
      "More than 500,000 student-athletes compete in NCAA championship sports, according to the association. While it\u2019s unclear how many are transgender, NCAA President Charlie Baker told a Senate committee in December that he is aware of fewer than 10.",
      "NFHS reported that more than 8 million students competed in high school sports last year, though the organization does not report how many are trans.",
      "In 2021, when dozens of states considered legislation to restrict trans athletes\u2019 participation in school sports, The Associated Press reached out to more than two dozen state lawmakers sponsoring the measures along with conservative groups supporting them and found that sponsors could not cite a single instance in their own state or region where such participation had caused problems.",
      "Prior to Trump\u2019s trans sports order, more than half of states had enacted measures restricting trans athletes from playing school sports on the teams that align with their gender identities.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is likely to face lawsuits. Courts have blocked state bans in Arizona, Idaho, Utah and West Virginia. New Hampshire\u2019s restriction has been blocked against the two trans plaintiffs who sued, and Montana\u2019s law has been permanently blocked from taking effect in colleges but not K-12 schools, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank."

      "The biggest question for critics of the response is why none of the neo-Nazi demonstrators was arrested after the group was confronted by community members, firearms on display on both sides.",
      "The Rev. Julian Armand Cook of Lincoln Heights Missionary Baptist Church said in an interview that the demonstration of hatred, which included swastika-adorned flags, was shocking.",
      "\"To see it show up at the gateway to this historic community, the first, the oldest Black self-governed city north of the Mason-Dixon Line, it is very clear what message it is sending,\" he said. \"So it was \u2014 I was angry. I was hurt. I was shocked.\"",
      "Evendale police said in a statement Tuesday that officers were bound to protect the First Amendment rights of demonstrators and that, even though the demonstration was carried out without a permit, it was legal. The police department said ticketing demonstrators for smaller matters such as transporting people in the back of a box truck \u2014 which they boarded as they left \u2014 without belted seats was overlooked in the name of preventing violence.",

      "To reach that goal, the department said, officers allowed a U-Haul box truck to safely get through counterdemonstrators, and an officer gave a ride to a neo-Nazi demonstrator who was told it was unsafe to return to a vehicle because counterdemonstrators were in the pathway.",

      "\u201cI can guarantee you we will get some action so that if this happens again, law enforcement will have the authority to take action,\u201d he said at a community meeting Monday, according to NBC affiliate WLWT of Cincinnati.",

      "Cook praised a community with a noted history of self-governance for taking care in the face of hatred.",
      "\"What must be kept at the forefront of this story is the way this community stepped in to de-escalate this situation themselves, and they did it in a way that preserved their dignity and their integrity,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "A New York City doctor said he will continue providing gender-affirming treatments to his patients younger than 19 despite President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order aiming to ban such care, because, the doctor said, these patients\u2019 lives depend on it.",
      "\u201cUntil somebody calls me away, I\u2019m just going to keep doing it,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Birnbaum, a pediatrician and adolescent medicine specialist. He doesn\u2019t think that will happen, he added, noting that New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a statement Monday telling doctors that state law requires them to continue providing such care.",
      "However, as a result of the order and the decision by several hospitals to voluntarily cancel appointments for individuals 18 and younger, Birnbaum said his patients are scared. He said about 20 of his patients could be affected by the order.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re terrified that their treatment is going to be interrupted, and they\u2019re going to lose their treatment, plain and simple,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for them, it\u2019s life-sustaining.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s order, \u201cProtecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\u201d aims to prohibit federal funding from being used for transition-related care \u2014 including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery \u2014 for trans people under 19 years old. It also states that medical schools and hospitals receiving federal research or education grants have to \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d",
      "The White House announced Monday, about a week after Trump signed the order, that hospitals in New York City, Colorado, Virginia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., have either suspended or announced that they are reviewing their transition care programs for minors. On Tuesday, Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles also announced that it was pausing the initiation of hormone therapy for gender-affirming care patients under 19.",
      "Birnbaum said Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to restrict care, along with another that describes the idea that someone can be trans as \u201cgender ideology,\u201d denies the realities of the people he treats every day.",
      "\u201cIf somebody says the sky is green, just because they say it, doesn\u2019t make the sky green,\u201d Birnbaum said. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the medical literature, research that\u2019s been done. I\u2019m looking at real people in front of me. I\u2019m not looking at some right-wing, religious ideologue who is referring to this as \u2018gender ideology.\u2019 It\u2019s no ideology. They have the ideology. I\u2019m dealing with science and medicine.\u201d",

      "Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to restrict trans care for those under 19 argues that the country has an obligation to protect children from \u201cirreversible medical interventions.\u201d",
      "\u201cCountless children soon regret that they have been mutilated and begin to grasp the horrifying tragedy that they will never be able to conceive children of their own or nurture their children through breastfeeding,\u201d the order states, using inflammatory language to describe transition-related care.",
      "Research shows that only a tiny percentage of minors in the U.S. access gender-affirming treatments. A study published in JAMA Pediatrics in January found that less than 0.1% of adolescents with private insurance are trans or gender-diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "One of Birnbaum\u2019s patients, Akoni Drysdale-Ash, a trans 17-year-old living in Brooklyn, said starting testosterone nearly three years ago has dramatically improved his quality of life. He said he felt a misalignment between his birth sex and gender identity around seventh grade, when he started having periods that made him feel \u201ctotally dissociated\u201d from his body.",
      "He compared not being able to access testosterone to trying to run a car on something other than gas. The idea of losing that access is scary, he said, even though he feels like his care is relatively protected in New York.\u201cIt does leave you with fear, because it\u2019s like you\u2019re taking away my visibility,\u201d Drysdale-Ash said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking away my care when all I want to do is live. Sometimes getting that care is all people need to live, being themselves. If I can\u2019t be myself, who else can I be?\u201d",
      "His mother, Jasmine Aldridge, added that her son hasn\u2019t received any irreversible treatments. If he stops taking testosterone, for example, he will experience the puberty associated with his birth sex, undoing many of the changes brought on by testosterone.",
      "In response to people who ask why trans minors can\u2019t wait until they\u2019re adults to receive transition care, Aldridge said, \u201cThere\u2019s that reality of your child might not even be here to see 19 if you don\u2019t support them.\u201d",
      "Standards of care developed by medical organizations, including WPATH, a nonprofit association dedicated to transgender medical care that develops guidance that is widely used by health care professionals, recommend that trans minors are treated on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The standards don\u2019t recommend any medical transition prior to puberty.",
      "At the onset of puberty, minors can begin puberty blockers if they have persistent gender dysphoria, which is the severe emotional distress caused by the misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and birth sex. Teenagers might start hormone therapy, and, in rare cases, some teens may receive a double mastectomy, where both breasts are removed.",
      "Most major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ legal advocacy group, filed a lawsuit to block Trump\u2019s orders regarding trans care and \u201cgender ideology\u201d last week on behalf of two transgender young adults and five families of trans minors. Three Democratic states also sued Friday to block the transition care order. New York\u2019s Letitia James and 12 other attorneys general issued a statement Wednesday reaffirming their commitment to protecting access to such care for minors.",
      "The Department of Justice and White House did not immediately return requests for comment regarding the lawsuits.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel and health care strategist for Lambda Legal, noted that Trump signed a flurry of executive orders targeting trans rights during his first weeks in office \u2014 including a ban on trans people serving and enlisting in the military \u2014 which he said is proof that the order restricting care for minors is not actually about protecting children.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re attacking adults as well,\u201d he said, adding that the other executive orders targeting trans rights all \u201cspeak to gender identity being considered a false belief \u2014 that a person having a gender identity inconsistent or incongruent with your sex assigned at birth is something that is dishonorable, even in one\u2019s private life. That\u2019s the language of these executive orders, and the disdain, the cruelty just drips out of the page.\u201d",
      "As the legal battle begins to play out, Birnbaum said he\u2019s shared the same message with many of his patients.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying that this is also a safe space. We\u2019re going to protect them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to interrupt their care, and we\u2019re going to help sustain who they are as human beings, plain and simple.\u201d"

      "What happens at the end of 'Apple Cider Vinegar'?",
      "Belle Gibson\u2019s whole life begins to unravel by the final episode of \u201cApple Cider Vinegar.\u201d",
      "Journalists Justin (Mark Coles Smith) and Sean (Richard Davies) send Belle a lengthy email with a slew of questions that put her story in jeopardy. The journalists question her cancer diagnosis, treatment and her claims of her company donating to charities. They are preparing to publish an article on Belle's indiscretions.",
      "Belle receives the email on her way to the funeral of Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Carey), a fellow wellness influencer who treated her cancer with alternative methods.",
      "At that time, Belle attempts to quickly make charitable donations, while putting the blame on an employee for not following through with said donations.",
      "In conjunction, Fiona, the mom of the young boy Hunter who has cancer, calls Belle asking for the $60,000 deposit for his surgery to save his life. Belle had previously raised funds for Hunter\u2019s treatment and never gave any to the family as promised. Fiona later tells Justin that she is stopping her son\u2019s treatment, implying that the family did not receive any of the funds Belle promised them.",
      "Just before Justin and Sean publish the expos\u00e9 on Belle, they try to convince her partner Clive (Ashley Zukerman) to tell them the truth about her cancer claims.",
      "When the story is published it only centers on her financial discrepancies because they don't have sufficient evidence to prove she lied about her cancer. However, Belle begins to panic as the negative comments roll in, including accusations that she\u2019s a liar.",
      "Justin\u2019s wife Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), who has breast cancer and was a fan of Belle's, replies in the article\u2019s comments section, \u201cDoes she even have cancer?!?!? Has that ever been officially verified?\u201d This sets off a chain of people questioning everything Belle has ever said.",
      "Belle\u2019s recipe book is taken off the market and it appears she is detained at an airport. When she\u2019s face down after security grabs her, she looks to the camera and says, \u201cThis is a true story based on a lie, based on truth that wasn\u2019t true.\u201d",
      "She circles around the truth in her 60 Minutes Australia interview",
      "Flash forward three months and she, Clive and her son are now in Beverly Hills and preparing for her interview with 60 Minutes Australia. Ahead of the interview, she asks that she be paid the full $75,000 or she will call off the interview.",
      "When asked if it's true or false that she underwent chemotherapy and radiation for two months, Belle replies, \"True.\"",
      "\u201cTrue, because at the time I believed I was having radiation. Nobody want to live with the fear of a terminal illness or dying,\u201d she replies.",

      "Belle admits, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. But I lived for years with the fear that I was dying and that was horrible. And I\u2019m still coming to terms with that, that I can take that off my shoulders now.\u201d",

      "As of late 2023, she still has not paid the fine, according to authors Donelly and Toscano. A spokesperson from Consumer Affairs Victoria the journalists the agency was \u201ccontinuing to pursue\u201d Gibson and said the \u201centire amount\u201d of her debt is \u201cstill outstanding.\u201d",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, the show\u2019s creator Strauss says she \u201calways wanted\u201d to have the 60 Minutes Australia interview be the ending of Belle\u2019s story.",
      "\u201cI liked the idea of ending Belle in \u2014 I would say \u2014 a fragile place of hope,\u201d Strauss says. \u201cMaybe, maybe, she\u2019s learned not to do this again. Maybe she won\u2019t repeat the cycles of her own past. But then it also felt like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s enough of Belle.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cWith our last title card, Belle\u2019s never paid her fine as far as we know. And she never went to jail,\u201d Strauss says. \u201cIn lots of ways, social media was her punishment. In a show like this, which is about social media (and) what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not real, I think hopefully people do go on Wikipedia afterwards.\u201d",

In fact, that was the first beginning of the memory was hearing him laugh and then looking up and realizing.\u201d",
      "Gasteyer, who imitated Martha Stewart and Celine Dion during her \u201cSNL\u201d tenure, said she has been thinking of the late president, who died in December at the age of 100, calling him \u201cextraordinarily humble,\u201d while pointing out that doing an impression means more than just getting laughs.",
      "\u201cIt is really true that imitation is the highest form of flattery, and I always do say, like with the Martha Stewart or Celine Dion or whatever that I\u2019ve done, that there\u2019s always this kernel of insight \u00a0or some kind of reflection back on the import of a person\u2019s impact on society,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSomething about that just registered in there for me, that the president was able to laugh at an idea of himself and see that in himself. It really was moving.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s a sentiment that Jenna can understand since her grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush, was famously impersonated on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d by Dana Carvey.",
      "\u201cAfter my grandfather lost (the 1992 presidential election), he actually had Dana Carvey, who he loved, come to the White House because he sort of felt like he had, not let his staff down, but, you know, \u00a0they were disappointed. So he came, and he performed as him, as my grandpa, for the staff to cheer them up,\u201d she said."

      "Yes, the long-running comedy series, which is celebrating its 50th season this year, has been known to feature memorable sketches that cause performers to break character and laugh, which, in turn, causes the studio audience and viewers at home to lose control, too. You can be sure these moments resonate and get people talking \u2014 well, at least after they\u2019re done laughing.",

When he\u2019s replaced by another man who resembles Butt-Head (Mikey Day), town hall host Heidi Gardner asks him to move, but not before she laughs and turns away from the camera in an attempt to collect herself.",
      "Her laughter goes on for quite a few seconds, while the audience howls in delight. When the faux Butt-Head starts talking to her and pleads ignorance, she continues laughing. Even after he walks away, Gardner still has trouble keeping a straight face as she tries to plow ahead with the sketch, which went viral.",
      "A few seconds later, we see Beavis and Butt-Head are seated together and that Gosling is busting a gut laughing, while Day also struggles to play it straight. Even Chloe Fineman, who has a bit part at the end, has to work hard to get through her lines, while all the extras in the scene actually do a masterful job of remaining serious.",
      "\u2018Lisa from Temecula\u2019 \u2014 Season 48 (2023)",
      "Ego Nwodim is hilarious as the hostile self-titled character in this bonkers sketch, who causes host Pedro Pascal to laugh while she violently cuts her steak that she requested \u201cextra, extra well done.\u201d Punkie Johnson also has to cover her mouth and Bowen Yang completely loses it when Nwodim asks if people are complaining because \u201cwe Black.\u201d",

      "What can be said that hasn\u2019t been said about this famous sketch? Chris Farley is deranged motivational speaker Matt Foley, who, as he likes to say, \"lives in a van down by the river.\" He is tasked with trying to get through to teenagers David Spade and host Christina Applegate.",
      "What follows is one of the most popular sketches in the show\u2019s history, with his outrageous behavior sparking fits of laughter from Spade and Applegate, who struggle not to laugh. As he comes down on them, they do all they can to not break. Extra credit here goes to Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks, who play the teens' parents and manage to keep it together the whole sketch.",

      "Bill Hader\u2019s Stefan is a beloved \u201cSNL\u201d character who often broke, with Hader covering his mouth to keep from giggling and showing his smile. As a correspondent on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d the eccentric Stefan\u2019s bits would often unravel, such as in this instance when he tries to make it through a segment giving Halloween tips for tourists in New York City. At one point, he buries his head in his hands while laughing and completely loses it.",
      "Hader often laughed while playing Stefon, but there's good reason for it. He created the character with John Mulaney, who co-created the character while working at \"SNL\" and would change lines for him to say without Hader knowing before he went onstage.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll put stuff up without telling me, or, he\u2019ll tell me as I walk out. Anything to kind of shake me up,\u201d Hader\u00a0told Howard Stern\u00a0in 2013.",

But when Will Ferrell, who had a knack for getting cast members to crack up, putters into the store in a motorized scooter and a tiny cell phone, all bets are off: Fallon and Hayes are cackling like there\u2019s no tomorrow.",

      "The first few minutes are uneventful, but Fallon starts to break after host Drew Barrymore gives a speech about her ex. Barrymore also starts to smile a bit and Dratch loses it when she and Ferrell share a plate of food. Soon, Ferrell joins Dratch with a case of the giggles that bubbles over more than the hot tub itself, as even Barrymore has trouble keeping her performance in line.",

      "A family trip to Disney World is ruined when Dratch dampens the excitement by only talking about depressing topics.

      "Let\u2019s go old school here in this Season 2 sketch, which features a message from the Right to Extreme Stupidity League. Bergen laughs when she points out Gilda Radner\u2019s Fern is kind of dumb after she pours milk into her purse. Radner quickly follows suit. When Radner turns to speak to the camera, Bergen is knee deep in laughter. It\u2019s a fun watch from two of the titans of comedy.",
      "\u2018The Californians: Stuart Has Cancer\u2019 \u2014 Season 37 (2012)",
      "Hader has trouble from the jump in this soap opera parody, in which he, Kristen Wiig and Fred Armisen show off exaggerated California accents while everyone gets overly specific about the routes they take to get places. Armisen also laughs early on, which sets off Hader even more. Wiig joins the party while giving directions to Armisen after host Josh Brolin, playing a doctor, informs him he has cancer.",
      "\u2018Super Showcase Spokesmodels\u2019 \u2014 Season 37 (2012)",

Wiig especially falls apart while plugging some frozen chicken. Things don\u2019t get much better for her when she starts wheeling around in a golf cart and exits the sketch by plowing through a sign."

    "summary": "In a network of prisons and detention camps across  Syria, the Islamic State militant group or ISIS, has an army in waiting, and support for its regime lives on.",
    "story": [
      "HASAKAH, Syria \u2014 In a network of prisons and detention camps across northeastern Syria, the Islamic State militant group has an army in waiting, and fanatical support for its brutal regime lives on.",
      "For now the prisons and camps are guarded by the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led fighting force that battled alongside the U.S. military to destroy ISIS\u2019 so-called caliphate.",
      "The Islamist group\u2019s radical ideology was never fully defeated, and after the ouster of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad late last year, as well as the arrival of a new administration in Washington, some are fearful that ISIS could be unleashed on the world once again.",
      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",
      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",
      "Among them is Ibrahim, a Moroccan national who admitted in an interview with NBC News late last month that he was an ISIS fighter but insisted that he was no longer a threat.",
      "\u201cIf I were dangerous, I would not have surrendered myself,\u201d said Ibrahim, who declined to give his last name. \u201cI just want to go back to my county.\u201d",
      "Imprisoned for six years, he is one of the many foreign detainees whose home countries have failed to repatriate them.",
      "For SDF commander Gen. Mazloum Abdi, these prisoners are among the most dangerous. \u201cThey are hard-liners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have massive numbers in our prisons, and this constitutes an ongoing threat.\u201d",
      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",
      "'One of the most dangerous camps in the world'",
      "On a barren stretch of desert roadway, just 26 miles east of Hasakah, is the sprawling Al Hol Camp \u2014 home to around 40,000 people, 93% of whom are women and children, according to the most recent figures from the United Nations, published last February.",
      "Many of them are the families of ISIS fighters and SDF officials said the camp was considered a breeding ground for the next generation of militants.",
      "\u201cA mindset of radicalism is instilled in the residents,\u201d said Jihan Hanan, Al Hol\u2019s director. \u201cThey are only becoming more extreme.\u201d",
      "With limited resources, she said staff could guard only the perimeter, meaning violence was rife inside what she called \u201c one of the most dangerous camps in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been murders inside, and some are armed with weapons,\u201d she said, adding that there were regular escape attempts.",
      "Inside the camp, in a section dubbed The Annex, the wives of foreign ISIS fighters and their children are held, around 6,000 people from 51 countries. Many of their governments have shown little or no interest in repatriating them in the six or so years they have languished in the camp.",
      "Considered by the SDF to hold the most extreme residents in the whole camp, The Annex is fenced off from the rest of the facility, with guard posts standing at the exit.",
      "Inside, wild dogs pick through piles of garbage, near trash-strewn muddy pathways and open sewers.",
      "Women gather together, all fully covered in the Islamic niqab, as hundreds of young children from strikingly diverse ethnic backgrounds wander through the squalor. There is little electricity or running water, and their patchwork plastic tents offer meager protection against Syria\u2019s winter chill.",
      "In another part of The Annex kids chant \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d while raising a single finger in the air, a trademark of ISIS. After hurling vulgar insults and threatening violence, they start to throw stones."

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday that it is \u201cunrealistic\u201d to aim for a return to Ukraine\u2019s borders as they were before 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and supported separatists who took over swaths of the country\u2019s east.",
      "The remarks are the clearest indication yet that the United States will support negotiations between Ukraine and Russia in which Ukraine cedes territory that\u2019s already been seized by the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine,\u201d Hegseth\u00a0said in a speech during a trip to NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels. \u201cBut we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective.\u201d",
      "\u201cChasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\u201d he told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, at which Western allies discuss Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion. \u201cWe will only end this devastating war \u2014 and establish a durable peace \u2014 by coupling allied strength with a realistic assessment of the battlefield.\u201d",
      "Hegseth\u2019s remarks put meat on the bone of Trump\u2019s radical departure from former President Joe Biden\u2019s policy. Whereas Biden focused on all-out Ukrainian victory, Trump says he wants to end the war as quickly as possible.",
      "The defense secretary is part of a high-level Trump team touring Europe this week, with allies eager to learn how this ambitious plan might come about. Many Ukrainians are hopeful of Trump\u2019s ability to end the conflict; others fear his negotiations will force them to accept unfavorable terms and embolden Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Hegseth sought to allay these fears by saying that \u201ca durable peace for Ukraine must include robust security guarantees to ensure that the war won\u2019t begin again.\u201d",
      "However, these guarantees should not include giving Ukraine NATO membership, as it has long desired, but instead have non-American troops \u201cdeployed as peacekeepers\u201d to the country, he said. These personnel should not be deployed as a NATO mission, or be covered by the alliance\u2019s Article 5 guarantee, under which allies agree to step in if any member is attacked, he added.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will not be U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump will seek to pressure the Kremlin by \u201cunleashing American energy production\u201d and thus throttling Russian exports that fund its war machine, Hegseth said. But he made clear that European nations would be required to provide most of the military support for Ukraine \u2014 which is currently underwritten by Washington more than any other nation.",
      "He said he was in Brussels to \u201cdirectly and unambiguously express\u00a0that stark strategic realities prevent the United States from being the primary guarantor of security in Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThe United States faces consequential threats to our homeland. We must \u2014 and we are \u2014 focusing on securing our own borders.\u201d",

      "Netanyahu's warning followed President Donald Trump's threat in recent days to let \u201call hell break out\u201d in Gaza, after Hamas reiterated Tuesday that it would indefinitely postpone the next round of hostage-prisoner swap scheduled for Saturday. The Palestinian organization has accused Israel of violating terms of their three-week-old ceasefire.",
      "After a four-hour emergency meeting with Israel's security Cabinet on Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu said he had received unanimous support to mass Israeli troops in and around Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon \u2014 the ceasefire will end and the [Israel Defense Forces] will return to intense fighting until Hamas is finally defeated,\u201d he said in a video statement following the meeting.",
      "It was unclear whether Netanyahu was referring to the three hostages originally scheduled to be released Saturday or all hostages held in Gaza.",
      "While Hamas earlier this week said it planned to delay hostage releases \u2014 it has accused Israel of carrying out deadly shootings, blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid and inhibiting Palestinians' passage to northern Gaza \u2014 it has since reaffirmed its commitment to the truce without explicitly reversing it position on freeing Israeli captives.",
      "Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told NBC News in an interview Tuesday that the militant group is committed to the ceasefire deal, to which \u201cit adheres fully and not selectively as the Israeli side does.\u201d",

      "On Tuesday, NBC News' crew on the ground in southern Gaza captured footage outside Nasser Hospital of a 33-year-old father of three, Mohammed Nafez Husni Abu Ta, who was killed after an Israeli tank opened fire in his neighborhood. His mother Ibtisam Abu Ta, 53, wept as she hugged his body.",

      "Nearly 16 months of war in the Gaza Strip were put on pause after a fragile, three-phase ceasefire deal came into effect Jan. 19.",
      "Under the first phase, due to last 42 days, Hamas has incrementally released 16 of 33 hostages, as well as separately releasing five Thai hostages.",
      "So far, 76 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza, with more than 35 of them believed to be dead. Most of those still held in Gaza were among the 250 people kidnapped during the Hamas-led terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli officials.",
      "Since Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza began, more than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed, with the majority of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million population forcibly displaced, according to local officials.",
      "In Netanyahu's statement late Tuesday, his rhetoric echoed that of Trump, who on Monday demanded that Hamas free all remaining hostages \"by Saturday at 12 o\u2019clock.\" The president did not specify whether he meant midnight or midday.",
      "Trump doubled down on his position Tuesday following a meeting at the White House with Jordan's King Abdullah, reiterating his belief that Jordan and Egypt should take in Palestinians displaced from Gaza.",
      "The Jordanian king reiterated his \"steadfast opposition\" to Trump's plan although he also said that Jordan could take in 2,000 Palestinian children from Gaza with cancer or other serious illnesses.",
      "Last week, Trump suggested that the 2.3 million residents of Gaza should leave the enclave so that the United States could take over and develop the territory into \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\u201d Netanyahu\u00a0on Tuesday said the security Cabinet had endorsed Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "This week's rising tensions suggest the ceasefire deal may be \u201capproaching a breaking point,\u201d Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow on the Middle East at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said Wednesday.",
      "Mekelberg told NBC News that Trump\u2019s comments make an already fragile situation more unpredictable.",
      "\"He sends the message that he wants to be the man for peace and every act that he is doing points to exactly the opposite direction,\" he said, adding that the Israeli government should end \"all this pandering to President Trump\" at the risk of being \"complicit in war crimes and probably destabilizing the Middle East.\"",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t be very surprised if it breaks even before we get to the end of the first phase,\u201d he said, referring to the planned end of the ceasefire's initial stage slated for March 2.",
      "While Trump's suggested plan has received broad-based support across Israel's political right wing, the families of hostages being held by Hamas also expressed their distress over the prospect of a breakdown in the ceasefire.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing the families of Israeli hostages, said in a statement Tuesday that \u201cwe must not go backward. We cannot allow the hostages to waste away in captivity.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments have also drawn widespread condemnation from the broader Arab world.",
      "Speaking at a summit in Dubai on Wednesday, Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said Trump\u2019s plans to take over Gaza would lead to a new cycle of crises. According to Reuters, he added that \u201cif the situation explodes militarily once more, all this effort will be wasted.\u201d",
      "Gheit also said the regional organization planned to reintroduce the Arab Peace Initiative, which was floated in 2002 to normalize ties with Israel in exchange for a statehood deal with Palestinians.",
      "Meanwhile, Egypt plans to host an emergency Arab summit Feb. 27 after Trump extended an open invitation to President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi\u00a0to discuss the matter the White House."

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",
      "\u201cIn our book, anyone from any religion, from any side, can say his opinion without being afraid. He can discuss any kind of thing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn the west side of Jerusalem, there are English bookstores that have the same books that we have, and you will never hear that they arrested the owners,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II said he reiterated Tuesday during a meeting with President Donald Trump his country's and the region's \"steadfast opposition\" to the president's plan to resettle millions of Palestinians out of Gaza.",
      "\u201cI stressed that my foremost commitment is to Jordan, to its stability and to the well-being of Jordanians,\u201d he said on X.\u00a0\u201cI reiterated Jordan\u2019s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the day, Abdullah told Trump he could take in 2,000 Palestinian children from Gaza who are very sick or have cancer. But the king later confirmed his longstanding position against displacing millions of Palestinians from their homes as Trump has suggested.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump said during their meeting Tuesday that he expected progress toward his plan and believed \u201c99%\u201d that something could be worked out with Egypt, another regional partner that had bristled at the president's surprise. \"We'll have some others helping,\" Trump added.",
      "Seated with Trump in the Oval Office, Abdullah said they must ensure a plan that satisfies all parties, a not insignificant obstacle as questions remain about how each country might move to relocate a swell of people who have suffered months of devastation, and which some fear will further undermine efforts to create a Palestinian state. More than 1 million Palestinians remain without homes, and the king declined to say whether he would be willing to take in refugees in larger numbers. \"We have to look at the best interests of the United States, of the people in the region, especially to my people of Jordan,\" he said.",
      "Questioned further by reporters about Trump\u2019s ideas, the king said he would refrain from saying much until Egypt had a chance to weigh in. His statement following the meeting with Trump made clear that the sides remain far apart.",
      "\u201cRebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all,\u201d he said on X. \u201cAchieving just peace on the basis of the two-state solution is the way to ensure regional stability.\u201d",
      "There are already over 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan,\u00a0according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees,\u00a0which says that most of them have citizenship. Jordan's Queen Rania and her family were Palestinian refugees who fled Kuwait.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to \u201cown\u201d the Gaza Strip and relocate its residents has stirred opposition from the U.S.\u2019s Arab partners and from world leaders across the globe who largely favor a two-state solution. However, Trump has not ceded the proposal and continued in the days since to press his ideas to take over and develop the territory after first announcing it last week during Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s visit to the White House.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Monday night, Trump said that those leaving Gaza would not have a right to return and named Egypt and Jordan as two countries that he expects to take in Palestinians. Trump said it\u2019s a project he wants to start \u201calmost immediately.\u201d He has referred to the territory as a demolition site.",
      "On Tuesday, he billed it as a step toward bringing \u201cpeace to the Middle East\u201d and said it would become a driver of new jobs in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run it very properly,\u201d Trump told reporters and reiterated his ideas for a development plan for the territory that includes hotels and other investments. Seated to the president's left were top advisers and officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, chief of staff Susie Wiles and national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a death trap,\u201d Trump said of Gaza as he mused about the possibilities. He said that it's a place where no one would want to stay, and \u201cthey are living in hell.\u201d",
      "Asked if he would consider withholding U.S. aid, Trump suggested he had moved on from the idea, telling reporters, \u201cI do think we\u2019re above that.\u201d",
      "\"We contribute a lot of money to Jordan and to Egypt, by the way, a lot to both, but I don\u2019t have to threaten that,\" Trump said, seeming to walk back the suggestion that he was open to it.",
      "A reliable U.S. partner, Abdullah now finds himself weighing a tentative path forward after America\u2019s Arab partners, including Jordan and Egypt, rejected Trump\u2019s proposal last week. On the eve of his meeting with Trump, the U.S. president threatened to cut off aid to Jordan, an annual sum of more than $1 billion. American foreign aid is currently paused as part of a sweeping halt by the Trump administration.",
      "A senior Jordanian official told NBC News\u00a0last week there was no way that Jordan could accept more refugees after harboring large refugee populations for decades from Syria and other countries in the region. But\u00a0Jordan relies heavily on U.S. aid \u2014 and additional U.S. spending in Jordan goes to defend U.S. interests supporting Syrian Defense Force allies guarding ISIS prisoners in Syria \u2014 and preventing a resurgence of ISIS in Syria.",
      "Trump's plan is also a nonstarter with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 a key U.S. partner who rejected it within an hour of Trump\u2019s initial comments last week.",
      "Jordan, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Monday, would resettle Palestinians from Gaza, as would other surrounding countries, because they have \u201cgood hearts.\u201d He said his administration had spoken to Palestinians who \u201cwould love to leave Gaza if they could find a place to be,\u201d as well as leaders in the region whom he said were working to find a solution to the devastation caused by more than 15 months of war between Hamas and Israel.",
      "\u201cThey were very positive about providing land,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat we need is land, and if we could build a nice place for people to live safely, everybody in Gaza would do it.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThey would love to get out of Gaza, but until now, they\u2019ve never had an alternative. Now they have an alternative.\u201d",
      "A fragile ceasefire has paused the fighting in Gaza, but the conflict risks reigniting as Hamas said it will postpone the release of more hostages. Trump has warned Hamas to release all remaining hostages by Saturday, but warned Tuesday that he believes they could blow past it.",
      "Netanyahu said Tuesday in a video statement posted to X that Israel is prepared to terminate the ceasefire agreement if Hamas does not return all the remaining hostages by Saturday."

      "There will be a record 116 medal events over 16 days sandwiched between the opening ceremony at Milan\u2019s famed San Siro Stadium and the closing ceremony at the historic Verona Arena, a Roman amphitheater.",
      "The U.S., which finished in the top five in total medals at the last six Winter Olympics, is loaded with stars, both in returning gold medalists and athletes who broke through since the last Winter Games, in 2022.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest names to watch out for.",
      "Mikaela Shiffrin eyes Alpine skiing rebound",
      "Mikaela Shiffrin, a gold medalist in 2014 and 2018, entered all six Alpine races at the 2022 Games but did not finish her three best events and ultimately won zero medals.",
      "Since then, she has broken the record for World Cup victories (now up to 99), won two World Cup overall season titles and became the most successful skier in modern world championships history.",
      "She also got engaged to Norwegian Alpine skier Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, a two-time Olympic medalist who is working toward a comeback of his own from a major race crash in January 2024.",
      "Shiffrin, who turns 30 on March 13, also missed time after race crashes in January 2024 and again last November. She recently returned to competition after being sidelined for two months.",
      "Her best events are slalom, where she has won six of her last seven World Cup starts, and giant slalom.",
      "At the Milan Cortina Games, Shiffrin can become the first American skier to win a third career Olympic gold medal and the oldest U.S. woman to win Olympic Alpine gold. She is already the youngest American to win an Olympic Alpine medal of any color via her slalom gold in 2014 at 18.",
      "Lindsey Vonn wants one more Olympics",
      "Now 40, Lindsey Vonn ended a five-year retirement to race this season, but her ultimate goal is to make a fifth Olympic team and retire for good after the Milan Cortina Games.",
      "Before Shiffrin, Vonn held the record for women\u2019s World Cup wins (82). She remains the lone American woman to win Olympic downhill gold in 2010.",
      "She retired in 2019 due to the physical toll of ski racing injuries accumulated over an 18-year career on the sport\u2019s highest level.",
      "But Vonn was reinvigorated after partial right knee replacement surgery last April. \u201cTo be able to ski without pain, it\u2019s a completely new world for me,\u201d she said before her first World Cup race in December. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in 15 years.\u201d",
      "Vonn should make the 2026 Olympic team if she keeps up the level shown in her first month and a half back. In seven World Cup races this season, her best results are fourth (super-G) and sixth (downhill).",
      "At the world championships last week, she skied out of the super-G after hooking a gate with her arm and then placed 15th in the downhill (won by American Breezy Johnson).",
      "She would be the oldest U.S. Olympic Alpine skier in history by five years.",
      "Ilia Malinin is figure skating\u2019s \u2018Quad God\u2019",
      "In 2022, a 17-year-old Ilia Malinin was left off the three-man Olympic team due to his inexperience despite placing second at the U.S. Championships. Now he has the best r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of any active male figure skater.",
      "Malinin, the son of Olympic skaters from Uzbekistan (who coach him in Virginia), is the two-time reigning world champion. He has won eight competitions in a row dating to December 2023.",
      "He has dominated largely due to his unprecedented arsenal of jumps. In September 2022, he became the first skater to land a clean quadruple axel in competition, the only type of quad jump that had yet to be done.",
      "This season, Malinin continued to live up to his self-given nickname \u2014 \u201cQuad God\u201d \u2014 by becoming the first skater to perform all six types of quad jumps in one program (though not all cleanly landed). He also incorporated a backflip into his free skate.",
      "Malinin has filled the void left by Nathan Chen, who stepped away from competing after winning the 2022 Olympic title. He can become the second American to take men\u2019s singles gold in his Olympic debut after the late Dick Button in 1948.",
      "Chloe Kim drops back in after break",
      "Chloe Kim has taken a full season off from competition after each of her Olympic halfpipe titles in 2018 and 2022, and each time quickly returned to the top of snowboarding.",
      "Over the last 16 months, she became the first woman to land a 1260 in a halfpipe competition, the first to land a double cork 1080 in competition, and, her coach asserts, the first to land a 1440 in practice. Though she has taken defeats, she won the biggest annual event in the sport, the X Games, in 2024 and 2025.",
      "\u201cI have to be honest; I was in a bit of a rut. I really did not enjoy snowboarding for a couple of years,\u201d Kim, now 24, said last month. \u201cI think this year I really wanted to change that and just do runs that felt good to me, do tricks that felt good to me. It kind of has been working out, no complaints.\u201d",
      "Kim, who in 2018 became the youngest Olympic halfpipe champion, is now in position to match the retired Shaun White\u2019s record of three Olympic halfpipe gold medals (though his were not consecutive).",
      "Jordan Stolz is speedskating\u2019s \u2018Straaljager\u2019",
      "As Jordan Stolz raced to gold at the 2023 World Championships, an excited TV commentator from the Netherlands, the world hotbed of speedskating, blurted out \u201cStraaljager!\u201d",
      "Translation: fighter jet.",
      "Stolz, a 20-year-old from Wisconsin, has taken the sport by storm since an unsatisfying Olympic debut in 2022 (13th- and 14th-place finishes as the youngest skater at the Beijing Games).",
      "Stolz started skating at age 5 on his backyard pond, inspired by watching Apolo Ohno win medals on TV at the 2010 Olympics.",
      "Now Stolz is favored to earn three medals in long track speedskating in 2026, just like Ohno did in short track in 2006 and 2010. Unlike Ohno, Stolz\u2019s could all be gold.",
      "He is the two-time reigning world champion in the 500 meter, 1,000 meter and 1,500 meter and the world record holder in the 1,000 meter. He won 18 World Cup races in a row from February 2024 to January 2025.",
      "He can become the second American to win three gold medals at a single Winter Olympics. The first was an athlete to whom Stolz is often compared: Eric Heiden, a fellow Wisconsinite who won all five speedskating events at the 1980 Lake Placid Games in arguably the greatest feat in Winter Olympics history.",
      "Here comes Jessie Diggins, again",
      "To many, Jessie Diggins is best known for clinching the first U.S. Olympic cross-country skiing gold medal \u2014 \u201cHere comes Diggins!\u201d was the famed broadcast call by Chad Salmela at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.",
      "In the seven years since, Diggins achieved many more firsts, including the first individual world title for a U.S. cross-country skier and two World Cup overall season titles. She now owns an Olympic medal of every color and two world championship medals of every color.",
      "Diggins has also shared her personal challenges. In June 2018, she published \u201cthe most important blog post I\u2019ll ever write,\u201d detailing her experience with an eating disorder when she was a teenager.",

      "She still races with \u201cThe Emily Program\u201d written on a patch on her headband. As a teen, Diggins checked in to the program, a national leader in eating disorder treatment, in her native Minnesota.",
      "Diggins, who got married in 2022, does not know how much longer she will compete. She has committed at least to a fourth Olympic run in 2026. She can become the first U.S. cross-country skier to win an individual gold medal."

      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d has earned almost almost $1.3 billion in the two weeks since it was released in mainland China, according to the Chinese ticketing platform Maoyan. In addition to being the most successful film in Chinese box office history, it is the first non-Hollywood film to earn more than $1 billion and the first film in the world to earn more than $1 billion in a single market.",
      "The movie is set for a limited release in the United States starting Friday.",
      "Inspired by a famous Chinese legend, \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d tells the story of a child deity named Ne Zha who rebels against his destiny and uses magical powers to protect his community from formidable enemies. It\u2019s the sequel to a hit movie released in 2019 that became the highest-grossing Chinese animated film at the time.",
      "Chinese moviegoers have showered the new film with praise, taking pride in the fact that it is entirely Chinese-made, from the director to the special effects and postproduction teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a purely Chinese animated film, deeply rooted in Chinese cultural heritage,\u201d said Nianyi Zhao, 29, an independent film critic in China. \u201cRegardless of how the story is structured, Chinese audiences are willing to support it as a way of promoting domestic animation and sharing Chinese culture with the world.\u201d",
      "Its success has been hailed as a sign of China\u2019s advances in filmmaking and the declining influence of Hollywood in China amid a growing cultural and national identity.",
      "\u201cThe film masterfully blends traditional Eastern aesthetics \u2014 such as Dunhuang murals and ink painting \u2014 with modern animation technology,\u201d said Neo Liu, a 31-year-old illustration designer from Beijing. \u201cIt was an impressive visual experience.\u201d",
      "Jiaozi, also known as Yang Yu, who directed and wrote both \u201cNe Zha\u201d films, told Chinese state-run broadcaster CCTV\u00a0that he had tried to outsource key visual work to top overseas studios, but the results fell short due to \u201carrogance and prejudice.\u201d",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d \u2014 whose Jan. 29 release coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday, a major moviegoing period \u2014 has brought a glimmer of hope to China\u2019s languishing film market, whose total box office last year was 34% lower than its pre-Covid peak in 2019, according to data from the China Film Administration.",
      "The film helped the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after North America, take in a record 9.5 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) during the eight-day Lunar New Year holiday, according to Maoyan, in a bright spot for Chinese officials struggling to boost consumer spending amid an economic slump.",
      "\u201cNe Zha 2\u201d quickly eclipsed China\u2019s previous highest-grossing film, 2021\u2019s \u201cThe Battle of Lake Changjin,\u201d a Korean War drama typical of the patriotic epics that have dominated the Chinese box office in recent years.",
      "It could also be on course to surpass last year\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the highest-grossing animated film of all time.",
      "Chinese state media have touted \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d as the latest in a series of Chinese cultural successes including last year\u2019s hit video game Black Myth: Wukong, the recent rush of American TikTok users to the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, and the market-moving rise of Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek.",
      "\u201cThe reason these products from different fields have been able to break through visible or invisible barriers and create an international buzz lies in the strong demand for exchanges in trade, culture, and public opinion between China and the world,\u201d the state-backed nationalist tabloid Global Times said in an editorial on Wednesday.",
      "Asked Wednesday about the success of \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Chinese films \u201care building new bridges for communication between China and other countries, and opening up a new window for the world to understand China.\u201d",
      "The film has also connected with Chinese audiences who see the character of Ne Zha as an anti-hero whose \u201cfighting spirit\u201d against authority and hierarchy serves as a counterpoint to the popular concept of \u201clying flat,\u201d or doing the bare minimum to get by in life while rejecting the relentless economic pressure of Chinese society.",
      "\u201cThis movie is so inspiring,\u201d read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. \u201cWe young people are very easily defeated in life but maybe we should live passionately, just like Ne Zha.\u201d",
      "The fanfare continues to build, with movie merchandise flying off the shelves and the film projected to earn nearly $2 billion in China alone.",
      "On Weibo, a hashtag called #NeZhaBoxOfficeRaisingNationalFlag is quickly gaining traction with billions of views, and many young people have said they are willing to pay to watch the movie multiple times to help boost its ranking.",
      "Not everyone is so effusive about the film.",
      "\u201cCompared to other movies from the same period, I guess I like it \u2014but mostly because the local Chinese films in recent years have been pretty underwhelming,\u201d said Ginger Zhang, a 29-year-old in Beijing.",
      "Vanessa Huang, a 31-year-old working in law, said she liked the movie and planned to watch it again, but it was not without flaws.",
      "\u201cNe Zha\u00a0in the original story has a strong anti-patriarchal theme, which wasn\u2019t really reflected in the film,\u201d she said. \u201cBut overall, it\u2019s still a solid work.\u201d"

      "Signs of the tensions between the U.S. and Europe on how to approach AI regulation emerged hours after Vance\u2019s speech.

      "\u201cPartnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure,\u201d he said.

    "title": "'A lot of people will die': How Trump's USAID overhaul could lead to famine in Sudan",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 18:20:41 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan, which is facing famine amid it's 2-year civil war.",
    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.",
      "The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.",
      "Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

      "An American woman who claims Andrew and Tristan Tate attempted to recruit her into a webcam sex trafficking ring filed a countersuit against the social media personalities on Monday, claiming they defamed her after she gave a testimony to Romanian authorities.",
      "The civil complaint was filed in a circuit court in Palm Beach County, Florida, by a woman identified in court documents as Jane Doe.",
      "The brothers, who have been fighting criminal cases in Romania and the U.K., have been accused of human trafficking, money laundering and sex crimes. They have denied all allegations against them.",
      "Jane Doe\u2019s countersuit comes after the Tate brothers sued her for defamation in 2023, accusing her and another woman of giving fabricated evidence to Romanian authorities and conspiring to defraud and falsely imprison them.",
      "But Jane Doe has been \u201crelentlessly harassed, threatened, and sued for merely cooperating with Romanian authorities,\u201d her attorney Dani Pinter, senior vice president at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAndrew and Tristan Tate have worked to ruin her life by suing her and her parents \u2014 an abuse of the legal system and blatant witness intimidation,\u201d Pinter said. \u201cToday, she is fighting back against this use of lawfare and her counterclaim against the Tate brothers shows that she will not be intimidated by their attempts to silence her.\u201d",
      "Alleging that the brothers\u2019 actions have caused her severe emotional distress, Jane Doe now seeks financial compensation at an amount to be determined at trial, as well as a court order prohibiting the Tate brothers from \u201ccontacting, harassing, or defaming\u201d her.",
      "Jane Doe\u2019s suit is the first U.S.-based lawsuit against the Tate brothers, who are both former kickboxers and dual U.S.-British citizens.",
      "They were indicted in Romania in June 2023 on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women \u2014 allegations they have denied. In December, a Romanian appeals court sent the case back to prosecutors for further review instead of putting it to trial, citing flaws in the indictment.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, a divisive social media personality known for his extreme rhetoric on women and masculinity, was temporarily placed under house arrest in August as Romanian prosecutors investigated a separate set of allegations, which include human trafficking of minors, sex with a minor and money laundering.",
      "He and Tristan Tate, 36, had been previously detained in Romania on allegations of sexual aggression in another old U.K. case. A Romanian court has approved their extradition to the U.K. once the brothers finish trial in Romania. The brothers are being monitored in Romania under judicial control, as their house arrest was lifted last month.",
      "Andrew and Tristan Tate\u2019s lawyer, Joseph McBride, said he is \u201cpleased\u201d with the progress of the Tates\u2019 defamation suit against Jane Doe, which has yet to go to trial.",
      "\u201cDiscovery is progressing in our case. The facts and law strongly support our claims. We look forward to the trial,\u201d McBride wrote in an email, adding that her countersuit is a \u201cpoorly constructed and desperate attempt to relitigate the failed Romanian criminal case in a U.S. court,\u201d referring to the case that was sent back to prosecutors.",
      "\u201cShockingly, NCOSE has blatantly disregarded Judge Curley\u2019s order to seal the Romanian indictment by copying and pasting large sections of the Romanian indictment into their flawed lawsuit,\u201d McBride wrote. \u201cWe will be seeking sanctions immediately.\u201d",
      "Jane Doe alleges that she was lured by Tristan Tate from Florida to Romania under the pretense of a romantic relationship.",
      "The two met online in late 2021 when Jane Doe was 20 years old, according to her lawsuit. Tristan Tate flew Jane Doe out to live with him in Romania and he imposed a set of rules on her, the lawsuit alleges, including one forbidding her from talking to anyone Tate didn\u2019t introduce her to.",
      "The lawsuit also cited alleged instances of Tristan Tate seemingly pressuring Jane Doe to create sexual content on OnlyFans, a subscription-based exclusive content platform popular with sex workers. It noted that he appeared to accept when she finally told him she didn\u2019t want to do so.",
      "She was living in a house with other women, all of whom were supposedly in a relationship with either Andrew or Tristan Tate, according to the lawsuit, which added that many of them appeared to be working \u201cvery long hours\u201d on their OnlyFans. After realizing that she hardly saw Tristan Tate despite having talked about spending time together, Jane Doe began getting worried she was \u201clured to Romania on false pretenses.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also alleged one woman told Jane Doe that she feared she \u201cwould end up dead\u201d if she told anyone the things she knew about the Tate brothers, and another woman told Jane Doe that she had not been paid for some work she had done for the Tates on TikTok. This and other observations, the lawsuit stated, made Jane Doe suspect that trafficking was occurring."
