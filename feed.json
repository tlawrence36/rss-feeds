      "LOS ANGELES -- Steve Guttenberg awoke Thursday morning to a grim reality: The treacherous wildfire that tore through the Pacific Palisades had left his once-lush neighborhood charred and unrecognizable.",
      "With homes smoldered, streets emptied and friends scattered by evacuation orders, Guttenberg counted himself among the fortunate. His property was miraculously spared. But the actor-producer still struggled to reconcile his relief with the haunting sight of his ravaged, once lavish community.",
      "\u201cJust this morning, I woke up and I was really conscious of my mental state and my mental health, because the last three days, I've seen so much tragedy,\u201d said Guttenberg, pacing through the ruins of his neighborhood. He said his home has electricity but no running water.",
      "Guttenberg thanked God that his block was safe, but he said about 20 homes were burned \u201cpretty bad\u201d in his 80-home community after wind-whipped fires tore across Los Angeles, destroying homes, clogging roadways as tens of thousands fled as the fires burned uncontained Wednesday. He said the fires are the worst he's ever seen in his 66-years.",
      "The wildfires have burned the homes of several celebrities including Billy Crystal, Carey Elwes and Paris Hilton.",
      "Guttenberg said he never expected all of this to happen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like when someone dies suddenly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like when someone gets hit by a car. You never expect that to happen. That\u2019s how shocking it was.\u201d",
      "During Guttenberg\u2019s stroll, it was an eerie scene with scorched palm trees, homes reduced to ash and rubble, and the daytime skies casted an ominous twilight over the devastation.",
      "\u201cI've seen people scared, people in wheelchairs, mothers and fathers trying to find their kids, people having anxiety and panic attacks,\u201d said Guttenberg, who returned to his neighborhood to help others who stayed behind with relief efforts. He has helped move cars to clear the street, handed out food and assisted neighbors from out their homes.",
      "\"All these houses behind me burned to the ground where their families enjoyed wonderful times together with their friends and family,\" said Guttenberg while pointing at one charred home before dropping his head in sadness. \u201cThere's really a lot of pain going on right now. I'm doing whatever I can to help alleviate it.\u201d",
      "For those looking to help, Guttenberg suggested starting with a simple call or text to ask displaced neighbors what they might need like food, supplies or emotional support. He also encouraged those who can return to their homes, if safe, to check on their property and assist others in assessing the damage.",
      "Guttenberg, the star of films like \u201cShort Circuit,\u201d \u201cPolice Academy and \u201dThree Men and a Baby,\" is unsure how the film and TV industry will able to help during the beginning of awards season.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s gonna do what regular people do: Help each other, give each other food and water, help each other in their backyards, in their front yards,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though somebody\u2019s an actor, producer, writer, director, we\u2019re all just people. .. Maybe people can donate at one point to some sort of fund. But I just think, be a good neighbor right now.\u201d",
      "When asked about the timeline for his neighborhood's recovery, Guttenberg thinks it could take anywhere from five to 10 years to rebuild and fully heal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a lot of work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be unbelievable to try to rebuild this. Rebuild all the beautiful trees, homes and retail shops and lifestyle. The psychology of it all, it\u2019s going to take a long time.\u201d"

      "Otto Schenk, an actor who became a noted director praised for traditional opera productions and criticized by advocates of contemporary approaches, died Thursday at age 94.",
      "Schenk lived in Austria, and his death was announced by the Vienna State Opera.",
      "He created 31 productions there, starting with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cJen\u016ffa\u201d in 1964 and ending with Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s \u201cThe Cunning Little Vixen\u201d in 2014. Many of his creations remain in use, including a 1979 version of Johann Strauss II's \u201cDie Fledermaus\u201d that was streamed around the world on New Year's Eve.",
      "\u201cOtto Schenk is an essential, unforgettable chapter in the history of our theater,\u201d Vienna State Opera Director Bogdan Ro\u0161\u010di\u0107 said in a statement. \u201cBut he was also an artist who shaped the world of theater for half a century like few others. As sacred as the theater was to him, he approached the works naturally and fearlessly, drawing on an immense knowledge. An infinite love for the singers went hand in hand with hard, uncompromising rehearsal work and honesty. \u201d",
      "Schenk led 16 productions at New York's Metropolitan Opera, starting with Puccini's \u201cTosca\u201d in 1968 and ending with Donizetti's \u201cDon Pasquale\u201d in 1996. His staging of Wagner's four-work \u201cDer Ring des Nibelungen\u201d premiered from 1986-89 and was shown in 20 full cycles from 1989 to 2009 and broadcast on public television in 1990. Schenk received a huge ovation when he took a curtain call after an April 18, 2009, performance of \u201cSiegfried.\u201d",
      "His romantic, realistic staging had set designer G\u00fcnther Schneider-Siemssen create images of a river, forest and mountains dominated by greens and oranges, and costumes by Rolf Langenfass that evoked the original Ring of the 1876 Bayreuth Festival. It was in a way a response to Patrice Ch\u00e9reau's centennial Ring at Bayreuth in 1976, set in an industrial age Ring and interpreted by some as Marxist.",
      "\u201cI wanted to tell a romantic old story, like starting with \u2018Once upon a time,\u2019\u201d Schenk said during a 1989 interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAll the secrets of Wagner\u2019s Ring should be guessed by the audience or found by the audience.\u201d",
      "Born in Vienna, Schenk studied acting at Vienna's University of Music and Performing Arts, began directing in 1953 and led his first opera, Mozart's \u201cDie Zauberfl\u00f6te (The Magic Flute),\" at Salzburg's State Theatre in 1957. He continued to act and performed 237 times at the Salzburg Festival from 1950-97, becoming head of drama there from 1986-88.",
      "\u201cThe theater world has lost one of its greatest phenomena, an exceptional artist, a real legend,\u201d current Salzburg Festival artistic director Markus Hinterh\u00e4user said in a statement.",
      "At the Met, his stagings of Offenbach's \u201cLes Contes d\u2019Hoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann)\u201d and Wagner's \u201cTannh\u00e4user\u201d in 1977 earned rave reviews, and Met artistic director James Levine picked him to direct a new Ring Cycle plus Wagner's \u201cParsifal\u201d in 1991 and \"Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg\" in 1993.",
      "\u201cAt a time when many new productions of `Der Ring des Nibelungen' might be more aptly entitled `Der Ringling des Barnum und Bailey,' the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s epic has cast a vote for the notion that maybe, just maybe, the composer knew best,\" New York Times critic Donal Henahan wrote in 1989. \u201cThe Metropolitan\u2019s trend-bucking project has aroused widespread suspicion, even resentment. `Traditional,' `conventional,' `regressive' and `childishly representational' were some of the nicer epithets thrown about in lobbies and in print. ... Even granting the possibility that radical rethinking of Wagner\u2019s works might occasionally stimulate thought about their everyday relevance, a staging that pays honor to the original is a useful counterbalance.\u201d",
      "Met presentations were long dominated by Schenk and Franco Zeffirelli, who had 11 stagings that premiered from 1964-98. Schenk said he did not look for hidden meanings.",
      "\u201cWagner in his life gave no indication on what the Ring meant,\" Schenk told the AP. \"He didn\u2019t interpret.\u201d"

      "The Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world two decades ago",
      "LONDON -- Two decades ago, the Scottish rock band Franz Ferdinand sent a jolt across the music world. They waltzed in stripped-shirts and quickly became global icons for their deliriously hooky songs, hitting a critical mass in the chant-along singles \u201cTake Me Out\u201d and \u201cDo You Want To.\u201d A lot has changed in that time, but the band never wavered in their dedication to 2000s indie ebullience. Over the last few years there's been a bit of an indie music resurgence, but for Franz Ferdinand, it never went away.",
      "On Friday, they will release \"The Human Fear,'' their sixth studio album and the first in seven years, making the end of the longest break between full lengths in their career.",
      "Frontman Alex Kapranos says the album tackles relationships forming and breaking down. \u201cThe title is a clue to the scene,\u201d he teases. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t written to the theme, at least not consciously.\u201d",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in London, Kapranos and Franz Ferdinand bassist Bob Hardy discussed about \u201cThe Human Fear,\u201d the resurgence of indie music and the band's love for Chappell Roan and Charli XCX. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "KAPRANOS: The last song that was written, the last lyrics that were written was (for) the song \u201cHooked.\u201d It starts off with the line, \u201cI\u2019ve got the fear / I\u2019ve got the human fear.\u201d And I realize that so many of the songs had an underlying theme of fear to them. But not necessarily succumbing to fear, but more like overcoming fear.",
      "\u201cThe Doctor\u201d is about the fear of leaving an institution, and \u201cBar Lonely\u201d is the fear of leaving a relationship. \u201cNight or Day\u201d is the fear of committing to a relationship. But fear is fascinating because fear is universal. We all experience fear. We all experience the same fears. But how we respond to it is individual. And that\u2019s how we find who we are, our personalities. And overcoming fear feels good. That\u2019s why we watch horror films or ride rollercoasters \u2014 because you overcome fear and then feel very alive for having done so.",
      "KAPRANOS: The song starts off addressing that feeling that we all have sometimes, which is, you know, you feel that your life is collapsing around about you for one reason or another. It could be a relationship that is disintegrating. Often, it'll go that things tend to happen to you (all) at once. The relationship starts going south as well as your professional life. And then you realize that the washing machine leaked and your basement\u2019s flooded and just all that kind of annoying stuff. Your phone gets nicked or whatever. And it can be overwhelming. And you just, you have this sense of fear that, \"Gosh, everything\u2019s collapsing.\"",
      "I guess I was feeling a little bit like that when I was writing the song for one reason or another. And I thought, \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d ... I\u2019m just going to do something astonishingly audacious. I\u2019m going to go into it with an audacious attitude and get through it that sort of way. And don't blame anybody else for it as well. Like, own the responsibility of overcoming the fear myself.",
      "KAPRANOS: We\u2019re not one of these kinds of bands that will sit down and say, \u201cRight, we\u2019ve got two months to write an album. \u201d For me, you\u2019re always writing, you\u2019re always coming up with ideas. And so, on this album, there\u2019s ideas that were written in the studio literally the day before it was sent off to be mastered. And there\u2019s also ideas \u2026 I think the oldest idea is the bassline (of) one of the songs, which is from 1995.",
      "I think the way my brain works is like if you imagine going into the office of a university\u2019s eccentric professor that\u2019s scattered with bits of paper. It's all kind of like catastrophic, organizational hell, but they know exactly where everything is. That\u2019s what my brain is like with bits of ideas and bits of songs and stuff like that. I know where they are, and when I need to use them, they\u2019ll come out.",
      "HARDY: And the show has become the reward for making records, to me. It all kind of focuses playing it live in front of an audience and seeing people react to it in the moment. When you release a record, you don\u2019t see people listen to it at home. You know, the way you kind of get the reaction is these live shows.",
      "HARDY: It's never gone away.",
      "KAPRANOS: There was a period in the late-2000s where there was point of saturation where, like, you turned on any mainstream radio show and you heard nothing but indie bands. And when it becomes that saturated, maybe the quality control goes down slightly. And then when that happens, there\u2019s always a reaction to it. And I think over the last decade, there\u2019s been a bit of, \u201cRight, okay, so we\u2019re going to listen to like pure pop instead.\u201d And of course, there\u2019s some brilliant stuff like Charli XCX. Amazing. Chappell Roan (is) incredible. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s maybe not quite premier tier as well. And I think there's been maybe a little bit of a reaction to that.",
      "I think from our perspective, just, yeah, make the thing that you love and then you\u2019re not really going to go wrong."

      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",

      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",

Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills.",
      "Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles.",
      "\u201cIf I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn\u2019t be standing up here,\u201d said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.",
      "Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds. It\u2019s the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards.",

Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.",

      "And Kelce said he received real guidance from Kimmel on the art of hosting.",

It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",

Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",

I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",

The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",

      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",
      "After treatment, \"I realized I was going to live, and then I said to myself, \u2018Do I want to continue doing this?\u2019\u201d Perkins said.",
      "She now caps her work as owner of Riverdale Avenue Books at about 50 hours per week, and as a result can't review as many manuscripts. Instead of sending rejection letters, she tells authors to come back in three to six months when it's less hectic.",
      "She practices saying \u201cno\u201d in her head and in her journal, where she also chronicles what happened after she said it. She's gained time to visit museums, friends and the theater.",
      "\u201cNo changed my life,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cI am a different person than I was before I really learned to embrace no.\"",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications during a recent five-year period",
      "As U.S. lawmakers debate issues around health care for transgender youth, it\u2019s been difficult to determine the number of young people receiving gender-affirming medications, leaving room for exaggerated and false claims.",
      "Now, a medical journal has published the most reliable estimate yet and the numbers are low, reflecting more clearly on medical practices now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications \u2014 puberty blockers or hormones \u2014 during a recent five-year period, according to the study released Monday.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A decision by the Supreme Court in a Tennessee case is expected later this year. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing inappropriate use of this sort of care,\" said lead author Landon Hughes, a Harvard University public health researcher. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not happening at the rate at which people often think it is.\u201d",
      "The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17.",
      "Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications.",
      "The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said.",
      "\u201cI hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,\u201d he said.",
      "The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.",
      "The study did not look at surgeries among transgender adolescents. Other researchers have found those procedures are extremely rare among young people.",
      "Not all transgender youth proceed with medical treatments, said Dr. Scott Leibowitz, co-lead author of the adolescent standards of care for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a leading transgender health group.",
      "Transgender adolescents \u201ccome to understand their gender at different times and in different ways,\u201d he said, noting that the best care should include experts in adolescent identity development who can work with families to help figure out what\u2019s appropriate for each young person.",
      "Leibowitz, who has worked in gender clinics in several U.S. cities, said the study \u201cadds to the growing evidence base about best practices when serving transgender and gender diverse youth.\u201d",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",

      "Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe.",
      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

      "",
      "Six months later, she said it seems clear to her that the healthcare needs of rural young women like her are largely ignored.",
      "",
      "For McCoy and others, figuring out how to obtain adequate care to safely have a baby in Baker City has quickly eclipsed concerns about another medical service lacking in the area: abortion. But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",
      "",
      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",
      "",
      "State Rep. Christine Goodwin, a Republican from a southwestern Oregon district, called the proposal the \"latest example\" of urban legislators telling rural leaders what their communities need.",
      "",
      "The mobile health clinic pilot was eventually removed from the bill that was under discussion. That means no new abortion options in Oregon's Baker County  --  and no new state-funded maternity care either.",
      "",
      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",
      "",
      "Witham said that while she does not support abortion, she believes the government should not \"legislate it away completely.\" She said that unless the government provides far more support for young families, like free child care and better mental healthcare, abortion should remain legal.",
      "",
      "Conversations with a liberal school board member, a moderate owner of a timber company, members of Baker City's Republican Party chapter, a local doula, several pregnant women, and the director of the Baker County Health Department  --  many of whom were not rigidly opposed to abortion  --  all turned up the same answer: No mobile clinics offering abortions here, please.",
      "",
      "Kelle Osborn, RN, a nurse supervisor for the Baker County Health Department, loved the idea of a mobile clinic that would provide education and birth control services to people in outlying areas. She was less thrilled about including abortion services in a clinic on wheels.",
      "",
      "\"It's not something that should just be handed out from a mobile van,\" she said of abortion services. She said people in her conservative rural county would probably avoid using the clinics for anything if they were understood to provide abortion services.",
      "",
      "Both Osborn and Meghan Chancey, MPH, the health department's director, said they would rank many healthcare priorities higher, including the need for a general surgeon, an ICU, and a dialysis clinic.",
      "",
      "Nationally, reproductive healthcare services of all types tend to be limited for people in rural areas, even within states that protect abortion access. More than two-thirds of people in \"maternity care deserts\"  --  all of which are in rural counties  --  must drive more than a half-hour to get obstetric care, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. For people in the Southern states where lawmakers installed abortion bans, abortion care can be up to 700 miles away, according to a data analysis by Axios.",
      "",
      "Nathan Defrees, MD, grew up in Baker City and has practiced medicine here since 2017. He works for a family medicine clinic. If a patient asks about abortion, he provides information about where and how one can be obtained, but he doesn't offer abortions himself.",
      "",
      "\"There's not a lot of anonymity in small towns for physicians who provide that care,\" he said. \"Many of us aren't willing to sacrifice the rest of our career for that.\"",
      "",
      "He also pointed to the small number of patients requesting the service locally. Just six people living in Baker County had an abortion in 2023, according to data from the Oregon Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, 125 residents had a baby that year.",
      "",
      "A doctor with obstetric training living in another rural part of the state has chosen to quietly provide early-stage abortions when asked. The doctor, concerned for their family's safety in the small, conservative town where they live, asked not to be identified.",
      "",
      "The idea that better access to abortion is not needed in rural areas seems naive, the doctor said. People most in need of abortion often don't have access to any medical service not already available in town, the doctor pointed out. The first patient the doctor provided an abortion for at the clinic was a meth user with no resources to travel or to manage an at-home medication abortion.",
      "",
      "\"It seemed entirely inappropriate for me to turn her away for care I had the training and the tools to do,\" the doctor said.",
      "",
      "Defrees said it has been easier for Baker County residents to get an abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "",
      "A new Planned Parenthood clinic in Ontario, Oregon, 70 miles away in neighboring Malheur County, was built primarily to provide services to people from the Boise metro area, but it also created an option for many living in rural eastern Oregon.",
      "",
      "Idaho is one of the 16 states with near-total bans on abortion. Like many states with bans, Idaho has struggled to maintain its already small fleet of fetal medicine doctors. The loss of regional expertise touches Baker City, too, Defrees said.",
      "",
      "For example, he said, the treatment plan for women who have a desired pregnancy but need a termination for medical reasons is now far less clear. \"It used to be those folks could go to Boise,\" he said. \"Now they can't. That does put us in a bind.\"",
      "",
      "Portland is the next closest option for that type of care, and that means a 300-mile drive along a set of highways that can be treacherous in winter.",
      "",
      "\"It's a lot scarier to be pregnant now in Baker City than it ever has been,\" Defrees said.",

      "Hurricane Helene brought unprecedented and catastrophic flooding to western North Carolina, damaging a Baxter manufacturing site that was a major supplier of IV fluids. Hospitals across the country continue to grapple with the ensuing shortage of critical supplies.",
      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "Greek lawmakers are debating legislation to regulate short-term rentals",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- Lawmakers in Greece began debating proposed legislation on Friday to toughen rules for short-term rentals amid a surge in tourism, including a ban on using converted storage spaces and windowless basements.",
      "Renovated warehouses, underground spaces and former industrial properties will be removed from rental platforms under the proposed changes, including locations already converted for hospitality use.",
      "\u201cBasements will no longer be allowed for use: Rental spaces must serve as primary residential use areas, with natural light, ventilation and air conditioning,\u201d Tourism Minister Olga Kefalogianni told state-run television ahead of the debate.",
      "\u201cWe are introducing minimum operational and safety standards, because this is a tourism product,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is the long-term, sustainable and high-quality development of Greek tourism, not just breaking records every year.\u201d",
      "The draft legislation coincides with a one-year ban in Athens on new short-term rental registrations in popular districts like Kolonaki, Koukaki and Exarchia, with violations punishable by a fine of 20,000 euros ($20,500).",
      "Vacation rentals have helped expand Greece\u2019s vital tourism industry \u2014 directly accounting for 13% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023 \u2014 but also added pressure on household expenses because of higher rents during the broader cost of living crisis.",
      "The government says it wants to balance tourism benefits with housing accessibility and is offering tax incentives for property owners to shift away from short-term leasing.",
      "Greece is expecting tourism revenue to reach a record 22 billion euros ($22.7 billion) in 2024 with a projected 35 million tourist arrivals, according to official estimates.",
      "The number of rooms available using short-term rentals was roughly equivalent to those in hotels nationwide in 2023, but nearly double in central Athens, according to a study commissioned by a national hoteliers association. The body is seeking tougher regulation of properties booked using online platforms like Airbnb.",
      "On the opening day of debate, several opposition lawmakers accused the center-right government of disregarding the social costs and the strain on resources caused by the expanding tourism and called for more comprehensive rental restrictions.",
      "\u201cYou are allowing the concentration of short-term rentals in areas popular with tourists. That is drastically transforming neighborhoods and displacing permanent residents,\u201d left-wing lawmaker Kalliopi Vetta told parliament.",
      "\u201cThe expansion of tourism is going unchecked,\u201d she said. \u201cThis focus on profit alone is happening at the expense of the environment and society.\u201d",
      "The draft legislation, which also introduces more detailed safety and operational standards for vacation rentals, is due to be voted later this month."

French immigration officials put him on a flight to Algiers Thursday, but Algeria refused to admit him, saying he was banned from entering its territory. He was finally sent back to France that evening, the French interior ministry said.",
      "Police in France have in recent days arrested four Algerian nationals described by authorities as social media influencers accused of posting videos inciting violence, against a backdrop of soured relations.",
      "\u201cI want to express my astonishment,\u201d Retailleau said Friday. \u201cI think we\u2019ve reached an extremely worrying threshold with Algeria. It\u2019s clear that Algeria is trying to humiliate France.\u201d",
      "The two countries have a turbulent relationship: Algeria, once a French colony, shook off rule from Paris in 1962 after a brutal war.",
      "Two other Algerian influencers were arrested last week in the Alpine city of Grenoble and the western port city of Brest, while a female TikTok influencer was taken into police custody in the city of Lyon on Thursday. She is accused of making \u201cdeath threats\u201d against opponents of the government in Algiers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no question of giving free rein to the hatred of these individuals who are spreading antisemitism, murder etc.,\u201d Retailleau said. \u201cSocial networks are not a lawless zone.\u201d",
      "Retailleau also sharply criticized the detention since November of French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal in Algeria, who is an outspoken critic of the Algerian government. Retailleau said Sansal is \u201cold and ill\u201d and accused Algiers of keeping him in prison \u201cfor the wrong reasons.\"",
      "A shift last July in France\u2019s decades-old position on the disputed Western Sahara region of northern Africa angered Algeria and prompted the withdrawal of its ambassador in Paris."

      "ABOARD THE EML SAKALA IN THE BALTIC SEA -- As they plied the gray, icy waters of the Baltic Sea west of Russia on Thursday, the crew of the Estonian minehunter EML Sakala kept a careful eye on any vessels slowing down suspiciously or suddenly changing course.",
      "They use binoculars and cameras with long zoom lenses, logging the names of ships, scouring them for missing anchors or trailing cables. The Sakala has approached about 200 vessels in a week at sea.",
      "It is one of three Estonian navy ships that are part of stepped-up maritime patrols by NATO countries after the Estlink-2 power cable and communication links between Finland and Estonia were damaged Dec. 25. A month earlier, two other undersea data cables were damaged.",
      "Suspicion immediately fell on Russia, although nothing has been proven and the Kremlin denied involvement in damaging the infrastructure, which provides power and communication for thousands of Europeans.",
      "For the West, the incidents are a test of resolve in the face of what are believed to be widespread sabotage attacks in Europe allegedly linked to Moscow following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is to show force,\u201d Lt. Cmdr. Meelis Kants of the Estonian navy told The Associated Press aboard the Sakala.",
      "After the Dec. 25 incident with the Estlink 2, Finnish police and border guards seized the Eagle S, an oil tanker that had just left a Russian port, after it was suspected of cutting the power and four telecommunications cables by dragging its anchor.",
      "The Eagle S, flagged in the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, is suspected of being part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid sanctions on Russian oil exports, Finnish authorities said. The ship was carrying 35,000 tons of oil and investigators allege it left a drag trail with its anchor for almost 100 kilometers (62 miles) on the sea bed before it was stopped and escorted to the vicinity of a Finnish port.",
      "The damage to the Estlink 2, which can provide about half of the electricity needs for Estonia in winter, did not disrupt service, although it did drive up energy prices in the Baltic nations.",
      "The cable is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) long and is located at a depth of 90 meters (295 feet) at its deepest point, across one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe. Repairs could cost tens of millions of dollars and might not be restored until late summer, said Finland\u2019s electricity grid operator.",
      "The undersea cables and pipelines that crisscross the sea link Nordic, Baltic and central European countries, promote trade, energy security and, in some cases, reduce dependence on Russian energy resources.",
      "Ten Baltic Sea cables have been damaged since 2023, affecting Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. At least two incidents involved ships later accused of dragging their anchors.",
      "\u201cThe sea domain is currently the most contested because it\u2019s also strategically important,\u201d Maj. Gen. Andrus Merilo, commander of the Estonian military, told AP in December.",
      "Western nations need to be \u201cmore proactive and operate to deter any activities,\" he said.",
      "The Estlink 2 disruption came just over a month after a Chinese ship, the Yi Peng 3, left the Russian port of Ust-Luga, west of St. Petersburg, shortly before it allegedly damaged cables linking Sweden and Lithuania and Finland and Germany.",
      "The ship was stopped by the Danish navy and spent a month idled in a Danish shipping lane before resuming its journey Dec. 21 after representatives from Western nations boarded it along with Chinese investigators. No details of the inspection were released.",
      "In October 2023, a Chinese-registered ship was suspected of severing a gas pipeline and fiber-optic cable between Finland and Estonia by dragging its anchor. That ship was not stopped and continued its journey.",
      "Of particular interest to the naval patrols is Russia\u2019s shadow fleet of vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to ship its oil and evade Western sanctions.",
      "The Eagle S had multiple violations including fire safety, navigation equipment and pump room ventilation and cannot sail until repaired, according to Finnish authorities. The shipping news journal Lloyd\u2019s List reported it previously was fitted with surveillance devices to monitor naval activity \u2014 abnormal for a merchant ship.",
      "The Baltic Sea incidents take place against a backdrop of allegations of Russian sabotage, attacks and killings in Europe, which have increased since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Such attacks are \u201coften in the shadows,\u201d Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told AP.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really know \u2014 at least not from the beginning \u2014 who is behind it. Is it an accident? Is it not? Is it hostile activity or not?\u201d he said, adding that the goal is to scare people and create a \u201dpolitical mess.\"",
      "While European authorities have acted more decisively in recent months to halt ships suspected of sabotage, officials have stopped short of categorically pointing the finger at Moscow without ironclad proof.",
      "Following the Estlink 2 incident, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told the German newspaper Die Welt that the \u201csabotage attempts in the Baltic Sea are not isolated incidents\u201d but \u201cpart of a pattern of deliberate and coordinated actions to damage our digital and energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish President Alexander Stubb and German Foreign Minister Annalenna Baerbock also suggested the similar incidents in the Baltic cannot be a coincidence.",
      "Merilo said the West must see the actions as building to the \u201cnext phase of escalation\u201d by Russia and be more forceful in saying: \u201cWe have some evidence, we cannot maybe prove it but we have to count it in as part of the ongoing operation.\u201d",
      "To get ahead of potential threats from hostile states, European nations must address them \u201con the same footing as we do with our collective security in NATO. This is a matter for all of us,\u201d Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re told AP.",
      "In December, the Joint Expeditionary Force, made up of 10 European nations from the Nordic and Baltic countries plus the U.K., Iceland and the Netherlands, agreed to cooperate more closely to counter Russia\u2019s use of shadow ships.",
      "They said they had tasked maritime authorities with requesting proof of insurance from suspected ships sailing through northern Europe, although that did not stop the Eagle S.",
      "Since then, the nations said they would use an AI-assisted computer program to help monitor and calculate the risk posed by each ship, with a system to warn NATO about suspicious vessels.",
      "Although the Baltic Sea is ringed by NATO members now that Finland and Sweden have joined since the invasion of Ukraine, the critical cables and pipelines are in a shallow area that is open to all ships, making such infrastructure an easy target for sabotage.",
      "During its patrols, the Sakala monitored a ship sailing from Finland to the U.K and an Antigua-and-Barbuda-flagged cargo ship traveling from Vyborg, Russia, to Gdansk, Poland.",
      "If the remaining power cable also was damaged, Estonia would have to rely largely on domestically produced energy at increased costs to consumers, which could increase pressure on the government \u2014 something that would benefit Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe Baltic Sea is something that we need to defend. We need to be here,\u201d Kants said on board the patrol ship.",

      "TORONTO -- Canada's governing Liberal Party will announce the country's next prime minister on March 9 after a leadership vote that follows the resignation of Justin Trudeau this week, party leaders said late Thursday.",
      "Trudeau remains prime minister until a new leader is chosen.",
      "The front runners for the Liberal leadership are former central banker Mark Carney and ex-Finance Minster Chrystia Freeland, whose abrupt resignation last month forced Trudeau's exit.",
      "\u201cAfter a robust and secure nation-wide process, the Liberal Party of Canada will choose a new leader on March 9, and be ready to fight and win the 2025 election,\u201d Sachit Mehra, President of the Liberal Party of Canada, said in a statement.",
      "The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump keeps calling Canada the 51st state and has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods.",
      "The next Liberal leader could be the shortest-tenured prime minister in the country's history. All three opposition parties have vowed to bring down the Liberals' minority government in a no confidence vote after Parliament resumes on March 24.",
      "Recent polls suggest the Liberals\u2019 chances of winning the next election look slim. In the latest poll by Nanos, the Liberals trail the opposition Conservatives 45% to 23%.",

      "Trudeau told Freeland last month he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister but that she could remain deputy prime minister and the point person for U.S.-Canada relations. Freeland resigned shortly after and released a scathing letter about the government that proved to be the last straw for the embattled leader.",
      "Freeland has been talking to her colleagues this week to discuss next steps.",
      "After she resigned, Trump called Freeland \u201ctotally toxic\u201d and \u201cnot at all conducive to making deals.\u201d Freeland was Canada's point person when the U.S, Canada and Mexico redid its free trade deal during the first Trump administration.",

      "The Liberals changed their rules years ago to make it easier for people to register as party members and vote in leadership elections, including eliminating all fees. But some Members of Parliament have said the party needs tighten its rules on who can register as a member after a foreign-interference inquiry heard about foreigners voting in local nomination races.",

      "A popular New Zealand bird \u201creality show\u201d that each year follows a pair of northern royal albatrosses as they breed and raise a chick has drawn a global audience of devoted fans in its current 10th season",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- It\u2019s a reality show about a loving couple waiting to welcome their new arrival, watched by thousands of ardent fans. But the stars of Royal Cam, now in its 10th season, aren\u2019t socialites or hopefuls in love but northern royal albatrosses \u2014 majestic New Zealand seabirds with 10-foot (3-meter) wingspans.",
      "The 24-hour livestream of the birds\u2019 breeding season at Taiaroa Head \u2014 a rugged headland on New Zealand\u2019s South Island \u2014 was established to raise awareness of the vulnerable species, numbers of which have grown slowly over decades of painstaking conservation measures.",
      "Millions have watched the stream since it began in 2016.",
      "\u201cBefore that, it was very difficult to follow an albatross\u2019 life cycle because they\u2019re only on land 15% of the time,\u201d said Sharyn Broni, a Department of Conservation ranger who has worked with the birds for nearly three decades. \u201cYou\u2019d have to travel a long way to see one.\u201d",
      "But Royal Cam's popularity exploded during the coronavirus pandemic. On a busy comments page hosted by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation, devoted fans track the birds\u2019 locations on an app, discuss significant moments and even create art inspired by the albatross.",
      "The show's premise is simple: Each season, conservation rangers select an albatross couple as that year\u2019s stars. A camera on the remote headland follows the chosen birds as they lay and incubate an egg, before their chick hatches around February, grows to adult size, and finally takes flight.",
      "Unlike human reality shows, drama is rare: Royal albatrosses usually mate for life. Rangers selecting the birds to follow each \u201cseason\u201d avoid anything controversial: no first-time parents and no aggressive or grumpy personalities.",
      "This year\u2019s stars are RLK, a 12-year-old male, and GLG, a 14-year-old female, who have raised two chicks before. Their names are derived from the colors on bands that rangers attach to their legs.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a youngish pair, but not so young that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Broni said.",
      "Action unfolds slowly, which for many fans is the joy of it. Clouds drift by, ships pass in the distance and the sun sets in glowing pinks and peaches. During January, incubation season, an albatross sits on an egg.",
      "But regular watchers anticipate certain moments: About once every 10 days, the second bird in the pair returns from feeding at sea to relieve the parent looking after the nest. Other fan highlights include albatross crash landings, mating dances and the appearances of rangers or the feathered stars of previous seasons.",
      "France Pilli\u00e8re, an artist who lives in Montreal, has never visited New Zealand. But during the pandemic she discovered Royal Cam, fell in love with the \u201cmysterious\u201d creatures, and became a daily viewer.",
      "\u201cYou see the birds and all their adventures and their lives, struggling to raise their chicks,\u201d she said.",
      "Pilli\u00e8re stayed, too, for the global community of posters. Unlike much of the internet, the nearly 75,000 comments on the Royal Cam viewing page are uniformly encouraging and educational.",
      "\u201cWe care about these people,\u201d Pilli\u00e8re said of her fellow posters. \u201cIf one is on a flight to New Zealand, everyone is waiting to hear their comments.\u201d",
      "The past two breeding seasons were the birds\u2019 most successful ever, with 33 chicks each year. There are more than 60 breeding pairs at the colony \u2014 conservation measures began in 1937 with one pair.",
      "Progress is unhurried because the northern royal albatross lives long and slowly; after their first flight, chicks stay at sea for 4 to 10 years \u2014 traveling up to 118,000 miles a year \u2014 then spend about three years choosing a mate. They live until around 40.",
      "The New Zealand mainland colony \u2014 one of four sites \u2014 is home to 1% of the 17,000 birds worldwide. While breeding measures have proved a success, Broni said, the birds are more threatened than before by plastic pollution, fisheries and warming seas.",
      "Pilli\u00e8re said the death of a chick from ingesting plastic in 2023 had prompted her to drastically reduce her household\u2019s plastic use. The royal albatross has also crept into her work as a sculptor of animals.",
      "The livestream of Taiaroa Head is \"a real soothing place,\u201d Pilli\u00e8re said. \u201cThe only thing you see is positive. The chatters will often say it\u2019s their best place to be.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s acting leader on Friday accepted the resignation of the chief of the presidential security service, Park Jong-joon, as he faced police questioning over how his forces blocked law enforcement efforts to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol last week.",
      "The acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, also expressed regret over the clashes between law enforcement officials and the presidential security service over the attempts to detain Yoon and called for lawmakers to reach a bipartisan agreement to launch an independent investigation.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials and police are planning a second attempt to bring Yoon into custody as they jointly investigate whether his brief martial law declaration on Dec. 3 amounted to an attempted rebellion. The presidential security service blocked an earlier attempt to detain Yoon at his official residence, which he has not left for weeks.",
      "Park ignored two summonses before appearing for questioning on Friday over allegations of obstructing justice, a week after his forces repelled dozens of anti-corruption and police investigators from Yoon\u2019s official residence. Park said his duty is to protect the president and warned of \u201cbloodshed,\u201d as critics said that his agency is becoming Yoon\u2019s private army.",
      "The anti-corruption office and police have vowed to make a second, more forceful effort to detain Yoon, warning that members of the presidential security staff could be arrested if they get in the way. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Park\u2019s resignation and Choi\u2019s call for an independent investigation to take over the probe on Yoon would affect their push to bring Yoon into custody.",
      "The embattled president remains holed up at his official residence in Seoul, where the presidential security service has fortified the grounds with barbed wire and rows of vehicles blocking the roads.",
      "Yoon made a short-lived declaration of martial law and deployed troops to surround the National Assembly on Dec. 3, which lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and voted to lift the measure.",
      "His presidential powers were suspended when the opposition-dominated Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 and accused him of rebellion. His fate now rests with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberating on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reject the charges and reinstate him.",
      "There\u2019s also speculation that police may attempt to detain Park and other leaders of the presidential security service before trying again to execute the detainment warrant against Yoon, which was renewed by a Seoul court on Tuesday.",
      "Speaking to reporters upon arriving for police questioning, Park again criticized the efforts to detain Yoon, saying that the investigation should proceed in a manner \u201cappropriate for the status of an incumbent president\u201d and the \u201cdignity of the nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany citizens are surely deeply concerned about the possible conflict and confrontation between government agencies,\u201d Park said. \u201cI came here today with the belief that under no circumstances should there be any physical clashes or bloodshed, and am hoping to prevent such incidents from occurring.\u201d",
      "Park said he made several calls to Choi, urging him to mediate an alternative approach with law enforcement and also made similar requests to Yoon\u2019s lawyers, but did not receive a satisfactory response.",
      "While the presidential security act mandates protection for Yoon, it does not authorize the service to block court-ordered detainments and some legal experts say the presidential security service\u2019s action last week may have been illegal.",
      "Asked in parliament about the presidential security service\u2019s effort to block the detention, National Court Administration head Cheon Dae-yeop said Friday that \u201cresistance without a legitimate reason can constitute a crime, such as obstruction of official duties.\u201d",
      "Although the president himself has wide-ranging immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have questioned the legitimacy of a new detention warrant against Yoon issued by the Seoul Western District Court, arguing that the anti-corruption agency lacks legal authority to investigate rebellion charges or order police to detain suspects.",
      "They also argue that detention and search warrants against Yoon cannot be enforced at his residence, citing a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have urged the agency to either indict the president or seek a formal arrest warrant, a process that requires a court hearing. However, they have said that Yoon would only comply with an arrest warrant issued by the Seoul Central District Court, which handles most key requests in high-profile cases.",
      "They accuse the agency of deliberately choosing another court with an allegedly favorable judge, even though the official residence is located in the jurisdiction of the Western District Court.",

      "PANAMA CITY -- A Panamanian national holiday remembering the killing of 21 protesters by police and U.S. troops in 1964 is taking on new resonance this year as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatens to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "On Jan. 9, 1964, students protested in the then-U.S. controlled canal zone over not being allowed to fly Panama\u2019s flag at a secondary school there. The protests expanded to general opposition to the U.S. presence in Panama and U.S. troops got involved.",
      "Historians say what has come to be known as Martyrs\u2019 Day was a key point of inflection that led to the signing of an agreement more than a decade later by U.S. President Jimmy Carter to turn over control of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.",

      "Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is travelling to Syria on Friday to encourage the transition in the country following the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents",
      "ROME -- Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is travelling to Syria on Friday to encourage the country's transition following the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents, and said Europe should review its sanctions on Damascus now that the political situation has changed.",
      "Tajani presided Thursday over a meeting in Rome of foreign ministry officials from five countries \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States \u2014 and spoke earlier by telephone with his counterparts from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The aim, he said, is to coordinate the various post-Assad initiatives, with Italy prepared to make proposals on private investments in health care for the Syrian population.",
      "Going into the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their European counterparts, Tajani said it was critical that all Syrians be recognized with equal rights. It was a reference to concerns about the rights of Christians and other minorities under Syria\u2019s new de facto authorities of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamic militant group that the U.S. and U.N. have long designated as a terrorist organization.",
      "\u201cThe first messages from Damascus have been positive. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going there tomorrow, to encourage this new phase that will help stabilize the international situation,\u201d said Tajani.",
      "Speaking to reporters, he said the European Union should discuss possible changes to the sanctions regime on Syria. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that should be discussed because Assad isn\u2019t there anymore, it\u2019s a new situation, and I think that the encouraging signals that are arriving should be further encouraged,\u201d he said.",
      "Syria has been under deeply isolating sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad\u2019s brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war.",
      "HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family\u2019s decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad\u2019s downfall, Syria\u2019s uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people.",
      "The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month.",
      "Syria\u2019s new leaders also have been urged to respect the rights of minorities and women. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria\u2019s civil war, either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents."

      "Uruguay\u2019s former guerilla-turned-president, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, has announced that the cancer in his esophagus had spread to his liver, and that he had chosen to forgo further treatment",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Uruguay\u2019s former guerilla-turned-president, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, announced on Thursday that the cancer in his esophagus had spread to his liver, and that he had chosen to forgo further treatment.",
      "In what Mujica said would be his last interview, he told Busqueda, a weekly news magazine in Uruguay, that he was \u201cdoomed.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I am dying,\u201d said the former leader, who governed the small South American nation of Uruguay from 2010 to 2015. The article noted that he had tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cWhat I ask is that they leave me alone. Don\u2019t ask me for more interviews or anything else,\" he said. \u201cMy cycle is over.\u201d",
      "Known among both fans and detractors as \u201cPepe\u201d Mujica, the folksy ex-president of Uruguay first burst into politics as a leader of the Tupamaros, the Marxist militant group that drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution.",
      "Later, as Uruguay's 40th president, he transformed his nation into one of the healthiest and most socially liberal democracies in Latin America, legalizing abortion, same-sex marriage and recreational marijuana. As a leftist icon, he sparked global fascination by shunning the presidential palace to live in a tiny farmhouse and donating most of his salary to charity.",
      "The 89-year-old first revealed last April that doctors had found a cancerous tumor in his esophagus. He underwent radiotherapy, and, last September, Mujica\u2019s doctors said the esophageal cancer appeared to have gone into remission.",
      "Although the radiation left him weak and almost unable to eat, Mujica reappeared on the political stage last fall, campaigning for his left-wing coalition, the Broad Front, in drama-free national elections that affirmed Uruguay as one of the region's strongest democracies.",
      "Mujica's preferred candidate and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Yamand\u00fa Orsi, won the presidential vote last November and is set to take office March 1.",
      "In the interview with Busqueda, Mujica said his autoimmune disease, severe kidney disease and other underlying medical problems led to his decision not to pursue treatment after medical tests showed his cancer had returned and metastasized.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old man, and because I have two chronic illnesses my body cannot handle it,\" he said.",
      "Mujica's personal doctor, Raquel Pannone, held a news conference Thursday to elaborate on the ex-president's medical condition. She said treatment options for the cancer were limited from the start, given Mujica's various illnesses.",
      "\u201cHe should continue like this and be as calm as possible,\u201d Pannone said, declining to provide further details about Mujica\u2019s prognosis. She said the leftist leader had not experienced changes to his daily life or pain levels.",
      "Although Mujica ostensibly retired from politics when he left the Senate in 2020, he remained a powerful force in the Broad Front. He is considered among the most popular politicians in the country.",
      "Mujica told Busqueda that he would devote his \u201cfinal stage\u201d of life to his farm on the outskirts of Montevideo, the capital, where he has grown chrysanthemums with his wife for decades.",
      "\u201cWhat I want is to say goodbye to my fellow countrymen,\u201d he said in the interview.",
      "His supporters, including leftist readers from across Latin America, shared messages of encouragement on social media.",
      "Seemingly unable to help himself from dispensing the plain-spoken wisdom for which he is admired, Mujica repeatedly answered interview questions with philosophical aphorisms.",
      "\"Life is a beautiful adventure and a miracle,\" he said. \u201cWe are too focused on wealth and not on happiness. We are focused only on doing things and, before you know it, life has passed you by.\u201d"

      "Protesters called for an end to Turkish airstrikes, which they said are damaging vital infrastructure and endangering civilian lives.",

Heavy fighting has been reported in areas near the Tishrin Dam, some 90 kilometers (60 miles) east of the city of Aleppo.",
      "\u201cWhile we were walking in this march, there were about 13 or 14 airstrikes around us,\u201d said Berfin Dumar from Kobani, who joined Wednesday\u2019s protest. \u201cThey tried to silence our voices so we wouldn\u2019t be able to protect this dam.\u201d",

      "\u201cAfter the collapse of the Baath regime, we were supposed to enter a new phase of dialogue and laying foundations to end the crisis,\u201d he said, referring to the ruling party under Assad. \u201cInstead, the Turkish state and its mercenaries have increased instability, added to the crisis, and turned Syria into a haven for those spreading corruption.\u201d",
      "He called on \u201cwhoever leads the government in Damascus to take responsibility and end the brutality and violence.\u201d",

      "Turkey views the SDF as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terror organization by Turkey and several other states, and has conducted several cross-border operations against the group since 2016.",
      "The SDF is, however, allied with the United States in the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria.",

      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk is preparing to host a live-streamed chat on his social media platform X with a leader of Germany\u2019s far-right Alternative for Germany party",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk is preparing to host a live-streamed chat on his social media platform X on Thursday with a leader of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party, amplifying concerns across Europe about potential meddling by the world's richest man in the upcoming national election there.",
      "Musk worked last year to help re-elect Donald Trump in the United States. Now Musk, in control of an influential social media platform that often spreads disinformation, is using it to endorse the far right in Germany ahead of its Feb. 23 election.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk wrote on X on Dec. 20, using the acronym for the party, known in German as Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland. He later doubled down on support for the AfD in an article for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, claiming Germany under center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz is \u201cteetering on the edge of economic and cultural collapse.\u201d",
      "He will host a chat on X-Space at 7 p.m. in Germany (1800GMT) with Alice Weidel, a co-leader of the party and its candidate for chancellor in Germany\u2019s election next month.",
      "The forays into politics by the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive is raising alarm across Europe.",
      "In addition to endorsing the AfD,  Musk has demanded the release of jailed U.K. anti-Islam extremist Tommy Robinson and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an evil tyrant who should be in prison. In Poland, there are concerns he could use his influence to interfere in the country's presidential election in May.",
      "Weidel and the party don't have widespread support ahead of the election, but AfD has been rising in popularity as some of the criticism around it weakens.",
      "Still, the AfD has been put under observation by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism, and mainstream parties have shunned working with it.",
      "The AfD has strongly rejected the designation and portrayed it as a political attempt to discredit the party.",
      "AfD was formed in 2013 and has moved steadily to the right. Its platform initially centered on opposition to bailouts for struggling eurozone members, but its vehement opposition to then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to allow in large numbers of refugees and other migrants in 2015 established the party as a significant political force.",
      "AfD has seen its support grow as a result of discontent with center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition government. It hopes to emerge as the biggest party in three state elections in the formerly communist east, where it has its strongest support, in September."

      "GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- Guyana said Thursday that it will seek help from the United Nations\u2019 top court to deter plans by neighboring Venezuela to elect a governor to rule its western Essequibo region, an area rich in resources long claimed by Venezuela as its own.",
      "Guyana\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement that Venezuela\u2019s plan violates a December 2022 agreement between the two countries to not trigger conflict or escalate tensions over the mineral- and oil-rich region comprising two-thirds of Guyana\u2019s land mass.",
      "\u201cThe people of Guyana\u2019s Essequibo region are Guyanese nationals who live in Guyana\u2019s sovereign territory,\" the ministry said. \u201cIt would be a flagrant violation of the most fundamental principles of international law, enshrined in the U.N. Charter, for Venezuela to attempt to conduct an election in Guyanese territory involving the participation of Guyanese nationals.\u201d",
      "The ministry said it would ask the International Court of Justice in The Netherlands for provisional measures to stop Venezuela in its tracks if it goes ahead with plans to elect a governor of Essequibo. It said plans by Venezuela to administratively incorporate Essequibo into Venezuela \u201cnot only jeopardize the judicial process but also undermine the authority of the court as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.\u201d",
      "Venezuela has always considered Essequibo as its own because the region was within its boundaries during the Spanish colonial period. It has long dismissed the border drawn by international arbitrators in 1899, when Guyana was still a British colony.",
      "After years of fruitless mediation, Guyana went to the world court in 2018, asking judges to rule that the 1899 border decision is valid and binding. Venezuela argues that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.",
      "A ruling is not expected this year because Venezuela was given until late August to reply to arguments made by Guyana.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s interest in the Essequibo region peaked after massive quantities of oil and gas were discovered off Guyana\u2019s coast in 2015, with oil production currently at 650,000 barrels a day.",
      "The latest dispute between the two countries comes just weeks after Guyana objected to the completion of a bridge by Venezuela\u2019s military on Guyana\u2019s side of the bordering Ankoko Island, calling it a breach of the country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity.",
      "Tensions between the two had eased for most of last year, especially after Guyana allowed the U.S. military to fly fighter jets over the capital, Georgetown, in May in a show of support for Guyana.",

      "M23 is the most prominent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich area near the Congolese border with Rwanda where more than 1 million people were displaced by fighting last year. Last month it captured the towns of Katale and Masisi, the latter located 80 kilometers (49 miles) west of the regional capital, Goma, a strategic entry point into the Congolese interior.",

      "The rebel group rose to prominence a decade ago when its fighters seized Goma, which borders Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal it accuses the Congolese government of not implementing. After lying largely dormant for a decade, M23 resurfaced in late 2021 and has since captured wide swathes of territory in eastern Congo.",

      "Rwandan authorities say the FDLR, whose members include alleged perpetrators of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, is embedded into the Congolese army.",
      "\u201cThe FDLR question has to be answered,\u201d Kagame said, accusing Congo of persecuting its own people and causing them to become refugees in Rwanda.",
      "M23\u2019s rebellion has caused the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in Congo\u2019s North Kivu province in recent years. While M23 leaders say they are committed to protecting civilians, their attempts to take towns cause widespread panic and fear as locals flee.",
      "Last February the U.S. State Department for the first time publicly described the M23 as a \u201cRwanda-backed\u201d armed group, and urged Rwanda \u201cto immediately withdraw all Rwanda Defense Force personnel from the (Congo) and remove its surface-to-air missile systems.\u201d",
      "U.N. experts previously said they had \u201csolid evidence\u201d that members of Rwanda\u2019s armed forces were conducting operations there in support of the M23.",

Her aides later claimed in a social media post that the video message had been coerced, and that after recording it, she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \u201ckidnapping\u201d later.",
      "In recent years, the word kidnapping has been associated with the government practice of detaining real or perceived opponents without following the law. It's seen as part of a campaign to repress anti-government protests that broke out after the election results were announced.",
      "Late Thursday, Machado in a post on X said she was \u201cin a safe place and with more determination than ever\u201d to continue her effort to get Maduro out of office. She also said that a person was shot \"when the repressive forces of the regime arrested me.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press was unable to contact Machado for clarification of her statement. She told supporters she would explain the day's events in more detail on Friday.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro's supporters denied Machado had been detained, claiming that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis.",
      "\u201cNobody should be surprised,\u201d Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \u201cEspecially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\u201d",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\u201cThey wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\u201d Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hard-liner and former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies among opposition leaders went into exile in the face of repression, joining an exodus of more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland since 2013.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, invoking the title of president-elect recognized by the United States and other countries, demanded her immediate release.",
      "\u201cTo the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\u201d he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump weighed in on Machado and Gonzalez's efforts. \u201cThese freedom fighters should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who have witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to turn out in large numbers as they have in the past.",
      "\u201cOf course, there\u2019s fewer people,\u201d empanada vendor Miguel Contreras said as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. \u201cThere\u2019s fear.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All condemned Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \u201ccolectivos\u201d to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\u201d said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \u201cHow Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\u201d in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\u201cMaduro is safe in office,\u201d said Corrales, \u201cbut he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\u201d",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Even many of Maduro\u2019s former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.",
      "President Joe Biden, meeting Gonz\u00e1lez at the White House this week, praised the previously unknown retired diplomat for having \" inspired millions.\"",
      "\u201cThe people of Venezuela deserve a peaceful transfer of power to the true winner of their presidential election,\u201d Biden said following the meeting.",

      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that \u201cthe post-Cold War peace is well and truly over.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and JD Vance are simply right when they say that Europe needs to do more to defend its own continent. It\u2019s myopia to pretend otherwise with Russia on the march,\u201d Lammy said during a speech in London setting out the center-left Labour government\u2019s approach to foreign policy, which he termed \u201cprogressive realism.\u201d",
      "Lammy said people often ask him when world affairs will get back to normal, and \"my answer is that they will not. Europe\u2019s future security is on a knife edge.\u201d",
      "Trump has for years expressed skepticism about NATO, openly questioning the value of the alliance that has defined American foreign policy for decades and threatening not to defend members that fail to meet defense-spending goals.",
      "This week Trump said NATO countries should spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, up from the current 2% target. He also said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark.",

      "Those have been undermined by Trump ally Elon Musk, who has sent a torrent of incendiary tweets in recent days attacking Prime Minister Keir Starmer and demanding he be replaced and imprisoned.",

      "Iran is reeling from a cratering economy and stinging military setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran is reeling from a cratering economy and stinging military setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East. Its bad times are likely to get worse once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House with his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran.",
      "Facing difficulties at home and abroad, Iran last week began an unusual two-month-long military drill. It includes testing air defenses near a key nuclear facility and preparing for exercises in waterways vital to the global oil trade.",
      "The military flexing seems aimed at projecting strength, but doubts about its power are high after the past year's setbacks.",
      "The December overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who Iran supported for years with money and troops, was a major blow to its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d across the region. The \u201caxis\u201d had already been hollowed out by Israel\u2019s punishing offensives last year against two militant groups backed by Iran \u2013 Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also attacked Iran directly on two occasions.",
      "An Iranian Revolutionary Guard general based in Syria offered a blunt assessment this week. \u201cI do not see it as a matter of pride that we lost Syria,\u201d Gen. Behrouz Esbati said, according to an audio recording of a speech he gave that was leaked to the media. \u201cWe lost. We badly lost. We blew it.\u201d",
      "At home, Iran\u2019s economy is in tatters.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have maintained stiff sanctions to deter it from developing nuclear weapons \u2014 and Iran's recent efforts to get them lifted through diplomacy have fallen flat. Pollution chokes the skies in the capital, Tehran, as power plants burn dirty fuel in their struggle to avoid outages during winter. And families are struggling to make ends meet as the Iranian currency, the rial, falls to record lows against the U.S. dollar.",
      "As these burdens rise, so does the likelihood of political protests, which have ignited nationwide in recent years over women's rights and the weak economy.",
      "How Trump chooses to engage with Iran remains to be seen. But on Tuesday he left open the possibility of the U.S. conducting preemptive airstrikes on nuclear sites where Iran is closer than ever to enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a military strategy,\u201d Trump told journalists at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida during a wide-ranging news conference. \u201cI\u2019m not answering questions on military strategy.\u201d",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, yet officials there increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb.",
      "It's not just Trump or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime foe of Tehran, that paint Iran's nuclear program as a major threat. French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking Monday to French ambassadors in Paris, described Iran as \u201cthe main strategic and security challenge for France, the Europeans, the entire region and well beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe acceleration of its nuclear program is bringing us very close to the breaking point,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIts ballistic program threatens European soil and our interests.\"",
      "While Europe had previously been seen as more conciliatory toward Iran, its attitude has hardened. That's likely because of what Macron described as Tehran's \u201cassertive and fully identified military support\u201d of Russia since it's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "France, as well as Germany and the United Kingdom, had been part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Under that deal, Iran limited its enrichment of uranium and drastically reduced its stockpile in exchange for the lifting of crushing, United Nations-backed economic sanctions. Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, and with those U.N. sanctions lifted, it provided cover for China's to purchase oil from Iran.",
      "But now France, Germany and the United Kingdom call Tehran's advances in its atomic program a \u201dnuclear escalation\" that needs to be addressed. That raises the possibility of Western nations pushing for what's called a \u201csnapback\u201d of those U.N. sanctions on Iran, which could be catastrophic for the Iranian economy. That \u201csnapback\u201d power expires in October.",
      "On Wednesday, Iran released a visiting Italian journalist, Cecilia Sala, after detaining her for three weeks \u2014 even though she had received the government's approval to report from there.",
      "Sala's arrest came days after Italian authorities arrested an Iranian engineer accused by the U.S. of supplying drone technology used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. The engineer remains in Italian custody.",
      "The length of the military drills started by Iran's armed forces and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard may be unusual, but their intended message to the U.S. and Israel \u2014 and to its domestic audience \u2014 is not. Iran is trying to show itself as capable of defending against any possible attack.",
      "On Tuesday, Iran held air-defense drills around its underground nuclear enrichment facility in the city of Natanz. It claimed it could intercept a so-called \u201cbunker buster\u201d bomb designed to destroy such sites.",
      "However, the drill did not involve any of its four advanced S-300 Russian air defense systems, which Israel targeted in its strikes on Iran. At least two are believed to have been damaged, and Israeli officials claim all have been taken out.",
      "\u201cSome of the U.S. and Israeli reservations about using force to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program have dissipated,\u201d wrote Kenneth Katzman, a longtime Iran analyst for the U.S. government who is now at the New York-based Soufan Center. \u201cIt appears likely that, at the very least, the Trump administration would not assertively dissuade Israel from striking Iranian facilities, even if the United States might decline to join the assault.\u201d",
      "There are other ways Iran could respond. This weekend, naval forces plan exercises in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Iran for years has threatened to close the strait \u2014 a narrow lane through which a fifth of global oil supplies are transported \u2014 and it has targeted oil tankers and other ships in those waters since 2019.",
      "\u201cHarassment and seizures are likely to remain the main tools of Iranian counteraction,\u201d the private maritime security firm Ambrey warned Thursday.",
      "Its allies may not be much help, though. The tempo of attacks on shipping lanes by Yemen's Houthi rebels, long armed by Iran, have slowed. And Iran has growing reservations about the reliability of Russia.",
      "In the recording of the speech by the Iranian general, Esbati, he alleges that Russia \u201cturned off all radars\u201d in Syria to allow an Israeli airstrike that hit a Guard intelligence center.",
      "Esbati also said Iranian missiles \u201cdon't have so much of an impact\u201d and that the U.S. would retaliate against any attack targeting its bases in the region.",
      "\u201cFor the time being and in this situation, dragging the region into a military operation does not agree (with the) interest of the resistance,\u201d he says.",

      "The situation in the village could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and cellphone service in the area mostly cut off.",
      "Myanmar is wracked by violence that began when the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After the army used lethal force to suppress peaceful demonstrations, many opponents of military rule took up arms and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press that a jet fighter bombed the village on Wednesday afternoon, killing 40 civilians and injuring more than 20 others.",
      "\u201cAll the dead were civilians. Among the dead and injured are women and children,\u201d Khaing Thukha said. A fire started by the airstrike spread through the village, destroying more than 500 houses, Khaing Thukha added.",
      "It was unclear why the village was targeted. The leader of a local charity group and independent media also reported the airstrike and casualties.",
      "The military government has stepped up airstrikes over the past three years on armed pro-democracy groups collectively known as the People\u2019s Defense Force and on armed ethnic minority groups that have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy. The two groups sometimes carry out joint operations against the army.",
      "Ramree, 340 kilometers (210 miles) northwest of Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, was captured by the Arakan Army in March last year.",
      "The Arakan Army is the well-trained and well-armed military wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement which seeks autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government. It is also a member of an alliance of armed ethnic groups that recently gained strategic territory in the country\u2019s northeast on the border with China.",
      "It began its offensive in Rakhine in November 2023 and has now gained control of a strategically important regional army headquarters and 14 of Rakhine\u2019s 17 townships, leaving only the state\u2019s capital, Sittwe, and two important townships near Ramree still in military government hands.",
      "A leader of the charity group, which has been assisting residents of the village, told AP on Thursday that at least 41 people were killed and 50 others were injured in the airstrike, which targeted the village\u2019s market.",
      "The leader, who was away from the town at the time of the airstrike, spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns. He said he received the information from members of his group who were in the village and were facing a shortage of medicine to treat the injured people.",
      "Rakhine-based news outlets including Arakan Princess Media also reported the attack and posted photos online showing people putting out fires at their homes.",
      "Rakhine, formerly known as Arakan, was the site of a brutal army counterinsurgency operation in 2017 that drove about 740,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to seek safety across the border in Bangladesh.",

      "The Sounion had been a disaster-in-waiting in the waterway, with 1 million barrels of crude oil aboard that had been struck and later sabotaged with explosives by the Iranian-backed Houthis as part of their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It took months for salvagers to tow the vessel away, extinguish the fires and offload the remaining crude oil.",

A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.",

      "The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023.

      "The decision by Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom, which came into effect a day after a gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine expired, halted gas supplies to Transnistria\u2019s gas-operated Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which provided a significant portion of Moldova\u2019s electricity.",
      "Copanca, like over a dozen other towns or villages administered by Moldovan authorities in the capital Chisinau but situated close to Transnistria, remains interconnected to the separatist region\u2019s Soviet-era energy infrastructure leaving them vulnerable amid the energy crisis.",
      "Planned daily electrical outages throughout Transnistria \u2014 which includes Copanca \u2014 are currently scheduled for four hours twice a day. While the Kuciurgan power plant transitioned to coal and has led to some unexpected outages, some residual gas remained in the pipes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get by with the electricity and gas shortages,\u201d said Donici. \u201cYesterday, we were without power for eight hours. Everyone is scratching their heads, figuring out what to do, so they don\u2019t freeze.\u201d",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, and has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy to destabilize the European Union candidate country. Russia has denied it is meddling in Moldova.",
      "Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean this week accused Russia of artificially creating an energy crisis to cause \u201cinstability in the region\u201d and \u201cto influence the results of the parliamentary elections\u201d that Moldova will hold later in 2025.",
      "\u201cWhat they want to achieve is to have a pro-Russian government in Moldova that would ultimately allow for the consolidation of the military capacity of Russia in the Transnistrian region, and correspondingly to use this leverage over Ukraine,\u201d Recean told journalists in a closed call with other senior officials on Monday.",
      "Transnistria \u2014 which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries \u2014 declared a state of emergency last month as the gas crisis loomed. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s roughly 350,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. Russia also bases about 1,500 troops in a so-called frozen conflict zone as \u201cpeacekeepers.\u201d",

      "Last month, Moldova\u2019s parliament also voted to impose a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, and fears that the situation could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where temperatures often drop to subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "The looming crisis also prompted Chisinau to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "Moldova's state energy company, Energocom, has increased electricity purchases from neighboring Romania to ensure capacity but are also more costly. Although a mild January is helping matters, energy prices have increased and the government has said it will provide help to offset bills.",
      "EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on the social media platform X this week that Russia \u201ccontinues to use gas as a weapon and once again Moldova is a target of its hybrid warfare,\" adding that \u201cThanks to EU support Moldova remains resilient and well-connected to European energy networks.\"",

      "Cutzari added that institutions in his village including a kindergarten, medical facilities, an ambulance, city hall and a post office would struggle if the gas ran out entirely. \u201cIt would be better if electricity and gas were always available,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",

      "Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest amount in 14 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Credit card defaults are on the rise for Americans, reaching the highest level in 14 years. U.S. credit card defaults jumped to a record $46 billion from January through September 2024, according to the Financial Times, citing data analyzed by BankRegData.",
      "With high levels of credit card debt and high inflation, many consumers have found themselves unable to cover monthly payments, leading some to default.",
      "A borrower goes into default when they miss credit card payments for over 180 days, roughly six months. When there is a failure to pay over such a long period, banks generally take this as a sign that a borrower won't pay the debt anymore, said Matt Sotir, financial advisor with Equitable Advisors based in New Hampshire.",
      "Defaulting on credit card debt can have serious consequences, including a negative impact on credit reports that lead to a long-lasting effect on the ability to borrow money, said Sotir.",
      "\u201cThese are debts that have a lot of impact and I think sometimes people don't realize that if they missed (a payment), how bad it could be for them in other areas,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "Here\u2019s what you should know about credit card defaults.",
      "There are several levels of consequences when credit card payments are not made. It begins with late fees, higher interest rates and a potentially lower credit score. If a borrower doesn't pay for 30 days the bank considers the credit card \u201cdelinquent\u201d and the borrower's credit scores can be damaged further.",
      "When a borrower fails to make a payment for roughly six months, the bank considers the credit card in default, which means they will close your account and refer you to a collection agency, said Chip Lupo, writer at WalletHub.",
      "\u201cThat's where you're going to really have trouble obtaining future credit for a while,\u201d said Lupo.",
      "When a collection agency assumes your debt, they will reach out via phone, email and mail to encourage you to pay up. Eventually, if not paid, the collection agency may take legal action against the borrower.",
      "The first step is to be proactive, recommended Sotir. Whether it\u2019s reaching out to your bank or working with a financial advisor, the quicker you start looking for viable solutions the more consequences you will be able to avoid.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it over the years, when someone gets in trouble, it\u2019s easy to cocoon and not want to deal with it,\u201d said Sotir",
      "Sotir and Bandebo recommend that you reach out to your credit card company to negotiate the debt since it\u2019s in the bank\u2019s best interest to help you catch up. If your account goes to a collections agency, find out if they can offer a payment plan or seek help from a non-profit credit counseling organization or financial advisor.",
      "It's best if you pay your credit card in full every month, but if that is not possible, gettting to at least the minimum monthly payment each month can help you avoid falling further into debt, said Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit modeling company.",
      "\u201cDo whatever you can not to get to the next stage. If you're 30 days late, try to avoid getting to 60 days and absolutely try to do everything you can to avoid getting default,\u201d said Bandebo.",
      "If you are having trouble making payments on your credit card, Bandebo recommends you reach out to your bank and ask if you can be placed in a payment plan.",
      "Other alternatives include reaching out to a credit counseling organization or transferring your credit card debt to a 0% interest card, though that typically comes with a fee.",
      "Defaulting on a credit card will mean serious consequences for your credit score, and that will limit how much you will be able to borrow in the future, and how much it will cost you. If you don't pay your credit card bill for a month, your credit score will likely fall between 60 and 100 points, said Bandebo. While there is not an specific amount of points that your credit score will fall should you default, it will appear on your credit report for seven years, added Bandebo.",
      "Bandebo often uses the analogy of credit scores being similar to reputation; it takes a long time to build up but one mistake to set you back for a long time.",
      "\u201cThere's not miracle solutions that once you've missed a payment, or you've gone to default, to simple go back to where you were. You can't just flip a switch,\" said Bandebo.",
      "If you find that you cannot regularly make payments to your credit cards, Sotir recommends you start by looking at your budget to find which expenses can be cut, and or considering whether you need an extra source of income.",
      "\u201cFor most people, it's really about understanding how much money is coming in and where it's going,\u201d added Sotir.",
      "If your expenses outweigh your income, Sotir recommends looking for a temporary second job, find if you have assets that you can sell, or asking family if they can help you while you get back on your feet. Additionally, some banks offer hardship programs that provide assistance for people who can\u2019t afford large and high-interest credit card balances.",
      "Bankruptcy should be considered the last option if you have exhausted all other alternatives, added Lupo.",
      "If your budget doesn\u2019t allow you to resume payments, it\u2019s important to start looking for alternatives as soon as possible, recommended Bandebo.",

      "In \u201cWorld Economic Situation and Prospects 2025,\u201d U.N. economists wrote that their positive prediction was driven by the strong although slowing growth forecast for China and the United States and by the robust performances anticipated for India and Indonesia. The European Union, Japan, and United Kingdom are expected to experience modest recovery, the report says.",

      "The report says the U.S. economy outperformed expectations last year thanks to consumer and public-sector spending, but growth is expected to slow from 2.8% to 1.9% this year.",
      "The report points out that China sees its own strong growth slowing slightly from 4.9% in 2024 to 4.8% in 2025 due to lower consumption and property-sector weaknesses that are failing to make up for public investment and export strength. This is forcing the government to enact policies to lift property markets, fight local government debt and boost demand.",
      "China's \u201cshrinking population and rising trade and technology tensions, if unaddressed, could undermine medium-term growth prospects,\u201d the report reads.",
      "The U.N. projected last January that 2024 global economic growth would be 2.4%. It said Thursday that the rate was estimated to have been higher, at 2.8%.",
      "Both remain below the 3% rate that the world saw before the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020.",
      "European growth this year is projected to gradually pick up after a weaker than expected performance in 2024. Japan is poised to pick up from periods of near-recession and recession. India is expected to drive a strong outlook for South Asia, with regional growth projected at 5.7% in 2025 and 6% in 2026.",
      "India's 6.6% growth forecast for 2025 is backed by solid private consumption and investment growth, the report says.",
      "\u201cThe global reduction of poverty over the past 30 years has been driven by strong economic performance. This has been especially true in Asia, where rapid economic growth and structural transformation have allowed countries such as China, India, and Indonesia to achieve poverty alleviation unprecedented in scale and scope,\u201d the report says.",
      "\u201cThe world economy has largely avoided a broad-based contraction despite the unprecedented shocks of the last few years and the most prolonged period of monetary tightening in history,\u201d said Li Junhua, director, of the Economic Analysis and Policy Division at the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.",
      "However, he cautioned, \u201cthe recovery remains driven primarily by a few large economies.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- Canada is looking at putting retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets and some steel products if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his threat to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products, a senior official familiar with the matter said Thursday.",
      "The official said the wide-ranging list hasn't been completed yet. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "Trump said this week he will use economic coercion to pressure Canada to become the nation\u2019s 51st state. And he continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Trump is trying to distract from his threats of stiff tariffs by talking about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that conversation,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cEverything American consumers buy from Canada is suddenly going to get a lot more expensive if he moves forward on these tariffs. And that\u2019s something we need to be focusing on a little bit more.\u201d",

      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",

      "\u201cWe don't need their energy. We don't need their oil and gas,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe don't need anything that they have.\u201d",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada's most populous province, said Trump has been misinformed about the U.S. not needing Canadian products.",
      "Supply chains for the auto industry are deeply connected, with parts manufactured in Ontario being used in cars that are assembled in Detroit and then sold back to Canada. Ford has noted that in the auto sector alone parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times.",
      "Ford warned that Canada will retaliate if Trump imposes tariffs. He said a wide range of U.S. products shipped to Canada will be targeted, but he declined to specify which ones.",
      "Top Canadian government officials say Trump\u2019s comments that Canada should become the 51st state are no longer a joke and are meant to undermine America\u2019s closest ally.",
      "\u201cThe joke is over,\u201d Dominic LeBlanc, the country\u2019s finance minister and point person for U.S.-Canada relations, said Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for him, I think, to sow confusion, to agitate people, to create chaos knowing this will never happen.\u201d",

      "Two hundred Utah ski patrollers returned to work Thursday after voting to accept a new labor contract and end a nearly two-week strike that closed many trails and caused long lift lines at the ones that remained open during a busy time of year at the country's biggest ski resort.",
      "The Park City Ski Professional Ski Patrol Association claimed victory, saying in a statement that Colorado-based Vail Resorts, which owns Park City Mountain Resort, acceded to its key demands including a $2-an-hour base-pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",
      "\"This contract is more than just a win for our team \u2014 it\u2019s a groundbreaking success in the ski and mountain worker industry. This effort demonstrates what can be achieved when workers stand together and fight for what they deserve,\u201d ski patroller and union lead negotiator Seth Dromgoole said in a statement.",
      "Union negotiators and Vail Resorts announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative deal. The full union voted Wednesday to accept the agreement.",
      "The strike began Dec. 27 after negotiations that started in March bogged down and the union accused Vail Resorts of bargaining unfairly. The strike coincided with the busy holiday season and a period of more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of fresh but difficult-to-access snowfall at the resort.",
      "Despite the closed trails and long lift lines, some skiers expressed support for the strikers, chanting \u201cPay your employees!\u201d in videos posted on social media.",

We apologize to our guests who were impacted by this strike and are incredibly grateful to our team who worked hard to keep the mountain open and operating safely over the past two weeks,\" Bill Rock, Vail Resorts' mountain division president, said in a statement.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. It said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",

It had been offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren\u2019t rare, but this strike happened after talks went much longer than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "\u201cThe issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling injured skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody is nearby. Many work other jobs in the summer, including as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides.",

      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "The late New York Sen_ Daniel Patrick Moynihan put it this way decades ago: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan memorably wrote four decades ago.",
      "That seems like a simpler time \u2014 especially when you consider Meta's decision to end a fact-checking program on social media apps Facebook, Instagram and Threads and what the ramifications might be for an industry built to bring clarity and to seek truth itself.",
      "Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's announcement this week was widely seen in news verification circles as a genuflection to president-elect Donald Trump, whose first term in office popularized the phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d",
      "Meta is replacing its fact-checking with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system reminiscent of X, where it depends on users to correct misinformation on its platforms. In a way, that hearkens back to \u201che said-she said\u201d journalism, or the view of some political debate moderators that it should be the role of opponents, not journalists, to point out falsehoods. It also hints at something else: the notion that the loudest voices and the best-told stories can win the day.",
      "The moment is a crossroads for the fact-checking industry, which will see its influence sharply curtailed when Trump takes office for his second term.",
      "\u201cIn the short term, this is bad news for people who want to go on social media to find trustworthy and accurate information,\u201d said Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network. Her organization started in 2015 with about 50 members and now has 170, some of whom face staff cuts and potential closure because of Meta's move.",
      "\u201cIn the long term,\" she said, \"I think it\u2019s very uncertain what this will all mean.\u201d",
      "Fact-checking is an odd industry, particularly when you consider that it's a function of all journalism. The concept bubbled up about three decades ago in part to counter \u201che said-she said\u201d stories and monitor claims in political ads. The organization FactCheck.org, whose primary aim was to help reporters, started in 2003 and the more public-facing PolitiFact four years later.",
      "PolitiFact, started by then-Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair in 2007, won a Pulitzer Prize for its 2008 campaign coverage. It called out politicians for bending or breaking the truth in ways often difficult for reporters who were protective of the sources whose voices populated their stories.",
      "By 2012, fact-checkers were under attack, primarily by Republicans convinced many were biased and researched voting records to try and prove the point, said Adair, now a Duke University professor. Trump, he said, \u201csped up a trend that had already begun.\u201d",
      "Some conservative suspicion of fact-checkers has been warranted because of mistakes that have been made, although there were some Republicans who uttered falsehoods and just didn\u2019t like being called out for it, said Steve Hayes, CEO and editor of the center-right site The Dispatch.",
      "\u201cThe people who practice fact-checking are in some ways saying, \u2019We are the arbiter of truth, period,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cAnd anytime you do this, it invites scrutiny on the work that you do.\u201d",
      "Labeling systems largely didn't help, either. Giving a misstatement the label of \u201cpants on fire,\u201d as some fact-checkers have, may be a catchy way of attracting attention but also fostered resentment.",
      "Holan resists the view that fact-checkers have been biased in their work: \u201cThat attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.\"",
      "GOP suspicion still quickly took root. Journalism's Poynter Institute, in a survey taken in 2019, found that 70% of Republicans thought the work of fact-checkers was one-sided. Roughly the same percentage of Democrats thought they were fair. Poynter hasn't asked the same question since. Yet last year, Poynter found that 52% of Americans say they generally find it difficult to determine whether what they're reading about elections is true or not.",
      "In a column Wednesday on the conservative watchdog site NewsBusters.org, Tim Graham wrote that during the first nine months of 2024, PolitiFact criticized Republican officials for delivering \u201cmostly false\u201d facts 88 times compared to 31 times for Democrats. To Graham, this proves that the idea the site is independent or nonpartisan is laughable.",
      "But is that bias? Or is it checking facts?",
      "Adair used to be reluctant to say what is now the title of his new book: \u201cBeyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do it More, and How it Could Burn Down Our Democracy.\u201d He's not hesitant anymore.",
      "\u201cTrump is unmatched as a liar in American politics,\u201d Adair said. \u201cI'm not the first to say that. I think he has capitalized on the fact that there has been this pushback on fact-checkers, and showed other politicians that you can get away with lying, so go ahead and do that.\u201d",
      "Tension about fact-checking played out during the recent presidential campaign, when Trump's team was furious with ABC News for calling attention to false statements by the former president during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump's second victory has changed the equation at Meta. Already, X has curtailed its independent fact-checking under owner Elon Musk, a Trump ally. The moves are significant because it removes fact-checking from venues where many users might not otherwise be exposed to it.",
      "On its own, fact-checking \u201cdoesn't reach those exposed to misinformation,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who started FactCheck.org. \u201cIt tends to reach audiences that were already knowledgeable and wary.\u201d",
      "On social media, fact-checking also became part of the algorithms that drove information to people, or away from them. Material labeled as false would often be downgraded so it received less exposure. To Republicans who have criticized Big Tech, that amounted to censorship. Yet to Jamieson, successful fact-checking is not censorship \u2014 \u201cit's the process of arguing.\"",
      "Jamieson expressed some optimism that other smart social media users will step up to prevent the dangerous spread of falsehoods. But for fact-checking as it is today to continue to thrive and, even, exist as a journalistic endeavor, Adair said it will likely take influential Republican figures to publicly stand up for the importance of truth.",
      "NewsBuster columnist Graham, in an interview, had a more pointed piece of advice. \u201cMy remedy in all arguments about media trust,\" he said, \u201cis that humility is required.\u201d",

      "For Jan. 9",
      "LONDON -- The new year is always a good time to make a fresh start \u2014 including with your email inbox. To kick off 2025 with a clean slate, why not clear out all those unnecessary and unwanted messages?",
      "If you're anything like me, you'll have piles of messages that have been accumulating in your inbox: receipts, bank and credit card statements, mobile phone bills, plane tickets, restaurant bookings, reminders, security warnings, spam and more.",
      "Mixed in with all that administrative detritus might be some personal missives from friends and family that are worth keeping.",
      "There are several reasons to purge all that digital clutter. For one, it cuts the risk in case of a data breach. If hackers somehow gain access to your email, they won't have any personal or financial info like credit card details to pilfer.",
      "A decluttered inbox also helps boost productivity and focus because it's easier to find important messages if you don't have to sift through reams of irrelevant ones.",
      "Some productivity proponents advocate inbox zero, a practice that requires dealing with each email that comes in so that by the end of the day your inbox is empty.",
      "But who has the time and energy for that? If you're busy, it's easier to just deal with the messages that need immediate attention and ignore the rest. That is, until the backlog becomes too big.",
      "Here are some tricks to tame your inbox by culling unwanted emails from important ones:",
      "Email accounts used to have limited storage space, say a gigabyte or two at most, which meant that messages with big attachments took up lots of space. Nowadays, email comes with plenty of free storage but it's still good practice to clear out oversized messages because they tend to build up over time. Do you really need to keep all those high-resolution photos of a forgotten friend's grandchildren?",
      "In Microsoft Outlook, click on the \u201cSize\u201d column or button to float the biggest messages to the top, where you can go through and delete them. Outlook also lets users sort by attachment so that messages with added files show at the top. If you want to save the message itself, right click on the attachment to remove it.",
      "In Gmail, go to the search settings to filter out messages that are \u201cgreater than\u201d a certain size. Start at, say, 20 megabytes, and then gradually reduce the number.",
      "Emails from frequent automated senders, such as newsletters and mailing lists, can take up a lot of space in your inbox. Or perhaps you get a lot of security notifications from your bank that might be important in the moment but quickly become outdated.",
      "It's often too tedious to delete them individually so filter your inbox by sender to delete them as a group. In Outlook click the \u201cFrom\u201d column or button. In Gmail or Yahoo mail, use the search bar to look for the sender's email address.",
      "Combine this with another search trick that narrows down the date range to filter out all those old emails that you never got around to deleting. In Outlook or Gmail, you can set a date range to capture emails from, for example, 2010 to 2017, so that you can get rid of, say, all those utility bills you don't need anymore.",
      "Emails from mailing lists tend to include certain words or language that makes it a bit easier to filter them out. One such obvious term is \u201cunsubscribe.\" Searching for a word like that, which wouldn't normally be used in emails written by humans, will identify all the newsletters for easy deletion.",
      "Copying everyone onto an email chain could be viewed as polite and courteous \u2014 or annoying, depending on whether the message topic is relevant to you. Sure, it's a good idea to CC everyone in the office about an important policy that applies to all staff but maybe not about a meeting about Bring Your Child to Work Day if you don't have kids.",
      "In Outlook there's a hack to filter out all those emails where you're not the main recipient. Go to the Home tab, click \u201cRules,\u201d and then \u201cCreate\u201d a rule. Go to Advanced Options, and tick \u201cwhere my name is in the cc box.\" For the next step, you can tick the box to move it to a folder, or even permanently delete it if you're feeling confident.",
      "Gmail users can do something similar with the search function. Type cc: and your email address.",
      "Perhaps you've tried out all these various hacks and whittled down your backlog but still have many more that you haven't gone through. Then it could be time to consider the nuclear option: delete everything.",
      "The benefit of this approach is that it really does provide you with a blank slate. You'll have no more mental anxiety if you don't have any more messages to worry about. The drawback, of course, is that you might lose any messages that might be important or precious.",

      "Tesla, BYD of China, and other manufacturers face big unknowns in 2025. Donald Trump's presidency could mean big policy shifts in tax and other incentives for both electric vehicle makers and consumers. The threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs globally, could further complicate production and sales for electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cThere's just a lot of uncertainty in the air,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of auto intelligence at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cIt's not an environment where you want to necessarily go gangbusters.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., consumers can currently claim a federal tax benefit of up to $7,500 for certain new electric vehicles. Carmakers also benefitted from some federal support for electric vehicle production and infrastructure. It's possible for all of that to get cut under President Trump.",
      "Trump condemned the federal tax credit for electric vehicles while campaigning for the presidency. He called it part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d that would would hurt the auto industry. Still, the incoming administration is expected push for broader deregulation of industries, which could potentially help carmakers.",
      "Some of the larger electric vehicle makers had a mixed 2024 even with benefits for consumers and manufacturers. Tesla sales slipped 1.1%, its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years. Rivian's deliveries rose 2.9%.",
      "Tariffs are another threat to the industry. Production takes place globally, with parts getting imported and exported throughout the process. Trump has threatened to tax imports from Mexico, Canada, China and elsewhere, which would likely result in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "China is the largest market for electric vehicles, followed by the U.S. Within the U.S., Tesla is the dominant electric vehicle maker, with about 50% of the market share.",
      "Automakers are in a wait-and-see position along with many other industries to see whether Trump carries out the threat of rescinding tax credits and implementing tariffs.",
      "The broader auto industry is proceeding with caution. Overall, S&P Global Mobility expects that light vehicle production will have slid 1.6% in 2024 and will fall another 0.4% in 2025.",
      "That's a result of automakers better matching production and demand. Overall light vehicle sales are still expected to rise 1.7% in 2025.",
      "The ongoing transition to electric vehicles also plays a role in more tempered production. Companies like Ford and General Motors are shifting production capacity to electric vehicles in some cases instead of adding more capacity."

Other passengers quickly restrained the man, and the plane never took off, but clearly it was a scary moment.",

Pilots landed the Boeing 737 Max safely, but videos from passengers showed the terrifying scene. The rapid loss of cabin pressure caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling, and suction as air rushed from the hole exerted force on people inside the plane.",

      "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said no bids were submitted for this week's oil and gas lease sale in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a sale the state has challenged as too restrictive and at odds with a 2017 law aimed at opening the refuge's sweeping coastal plan to exploration and development.",
      "Monday was the deadline for companies to submit bids, the agency said.",
      "Interior Acting Deputy Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said the lack of interest by oil companies in pursuing leases in the refuge's coastal plain \u201creflects what we and they have known all along \u2013 there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil and gas drilling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe oil and gas industry is sitting on millions of acres of undeveloped leases elsewhere; we\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a prudent place to start, rather than engage further in speculative leasing in one of the most spectacular places in the world,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "But this is unlikely to be the last word. The state this week sued the Interior Department and federal officials over the sale, alleging among other things that the terms were too restrictive. The state also is seeking to have the environmental review underpinning the sale thrown out. Litigation around the first lease sale \u2014 held in the waning days of the Trump administration in early 2021 \u2014 also is still pending.",
      "A 2017 law that President-elect Donald Trump has often highlighted called for offering two lease sales in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain by late 2024. Major oil companies sat out the first sale, which saw a state corporation as the main bidder. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts as president was to order a review of the leasing program, which ultimately led to the cancelation of seven remaining leases. Smaller companies had previously given up two other leases they'd held from that sale.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, has said that it offered for lease as part of the smaller, second sale 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares), the minimum acreage required by the 2017 law. The agency said its proposal avoided important polar bear denning and caribou calving areas and had the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance.",
      "Leaders in Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and oppose drilling there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and see responsible oil development as critical to the economic wellbeing of communities in the region.",
      "Drilling advocates \u2014 including state political leaders \u2014 are hopeful Trump will pursue drilling in the refuge, seeing a potential to create jobs, generate additional revenue and spur U.S. oil production. But while the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil there. And environmentalists contend the lack of interest by oil companies so far should speak volumes.",
      "\u201cThey seem to understand that drilling in this remote landscape is\u202ftoo risky, too complicated and just plain wrong,\u201d Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement. \"The incoming Trump administration still hasn\u2019t gotten the memo and has vowed to keep trying to sell the refuge for oil. We\u2019ll continue to use the power of the law to defend this cherished place, as we have for decades.\u201d"

      "Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes.",
      "Minutes from the meeting, released after the typical three-week lag, also showed clear division among the Fed's 19 policymakers. Some officials expressed support for keeping the central bank's key rate unchanged, the minutes said. And a majority of the officials said the decision to cut rates was a close call.",
      "Ultimately, the Fed choose to cut its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.3%. One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged.",
      "Still, there was widespread agreement in the minutes that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, Fed officials felt it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate.",
      "Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses \u2014 including for homes, cars, and credit cards \u2014 will remain elevated this year.",
      "Policymakers said that the Fed \u201cwas at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing,\u201d the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting, Fed officials said they expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four.",
      "Fed officials sent stock markets plummeting Dec. 18 after they reduced their outlook for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting that the decision to reduce rates had been a \u201cclose call.\"",
      "Powell also said that recent signs of stubborn inflation have caused many Fed officials to pare back their expectations for rate cuts. Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred measure, ticked up to 2.4% in November, compared with a year ago, above the Fed's target. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, it was 2.8%.",
      "In addition, some officials have started to consider the potential impact of President-elect Trump's proposals, such as widespread tariffs, on the economy and inflation next year, the minutes said.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs, for example, have estimated that Trump's tariff proposals could push inflation by nearly a half-percentage point later this year.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he still supported rate reductions this year, in part because he expects inflation to steadily head down to the Fed's 2% target. He also said he didn't expect tariffs would worsen inflation and wouldn't change his preference for lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Waller also said, in a question and answer session, that he didn't think Trump would ultimately impose the universal tariffs he promised in the campaign."

    "story": [
      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort have reached a deal to end a strike that put a wrench in operations during the busy holiday season",
      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort reached a tentative deal with the corporate owner of Utah's Park City Mountain Resort to end a strike and resume normal operations after almost two weeks of closed terrain and long lift lines at the busiest time of year.",
      "Neither the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association nor Colorado-based Vail Resorts released details about the agreement ahead of a planned ratification vote Wednesday.",
      "Whatever happens, the strike brought attention \u2014 and judging from the many supportive car honks for strikers, sympathy \u2014 to the struggle of ski patrollers to make ends meet in pricey mountain communities.",
      "A union win could produce better pay for other ski workers, predicted one industry watcher.",
      "\u201cGenerally when one group of employees successfully bargains for a contract they think is fair, it does tend to create the \u2018rising tide lifts all boats\u2019 dynamic,\u201d said Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and the cost of living is well above average.",
      "The 200 ski patrollers at Park City Mountain Resort went on strike on Dec. 27 alleging unfair bargaining in negotiations since March. The tentative deal to be in effect through April 2027 had the unanimous approval of ski patrol negotiators, according to a joint statement from the union and the resort.",
      "\u201cEveryone looks forward to restoring normal resort operations and moving forward together as one team,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling hurt skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody\u2019s nearby. It\u2019s specialized work where familiarity with a resort\u2019s terrain and how to respond to a variety of injuries and situations can be valuable.",
      "It's also a seasonal job. Many ski patrollers work as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides in warmer months.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. The union said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "It also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It was offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren't unusual, but this strike happened after talks went much longer into the year than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Kaufman.",
      "\"The issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\" Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Despite long waits, even some Park City Mountain Resort skiers have been sympathetic to the workers. \u201cPay your employees!\u201d they chanted from lift lines in videos posted on social media.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "The 45,000 dockworkers\u2019 ongoing threats to resume their strike over automation would shut down ports and could damage the economy as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House."

      "An independent watchdog finds the IRS has improved its overall taxpayer service through Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act but still faces delays processing claims from a coronavirus pandemic-era tax credit program and is slow to resolve certain identi...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS boosted taxpayer services through Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act but still faces processing claims from a coronavirus pandemic-era tax credit program and is slow to resolve certain identity theft cases, according to an independent watchdog report released Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFor the first time since I became the National Taxpayer Advocate in 2020, I can begin this report with good news: The taxpayer experience has noticeably improved,\u201d Erin M. Collins wrote in her 2024 annual report to Congress.",
      "She said \u201cthe IRS has made major strides\u201d with the help of the billions of dollars in multiyear funding, though she notes that \u201cIRS service remains far from perfect.\u201d",
      "Remaining service gaps include prolonged delays in resolving claims from the nearly half a million taxpayers whose identities were stolen by fraudsters who received a refund on their behalf. The delays have increased from 19 months in 2023 to 22 months in 2024, according to the report.",
      "In addition, the report says there have been lengthy delays in the resolution of eligible Employee Retention Credit claims submitted by employers who rely on those refunds to stay in business.",
      "The Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, was designed to help businesses retain employees during pandemic-era shutdowns, but it quickly became a magnet for fraud. Its complex eligibility rules allowed scammers to target small businesses, offering help applying for it for a fee \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t qualify.",
      "In September 2023, the IRS announced a pause in accepting claims for the tax credit until 2024 because of rising concerns that an influx of applications were fraudulent.",
      "\u201cAlthough the IRS has processed several hundred thousand claims in recent months, it was still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024,\" Collins said in her Wednesday report. \u201cMany claims have been pending for more than a year.\u201d",
      "IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said \u201cthings are trending in a very positive direction in terms of our performance in taxpayer service,\u201d but still, \u201cI view the identity theft issue as our largest current service gap.\u201d He said the agency is seeing higher numbers of theft victims overall since before the pandemic, in part because scammers are increasingly moving to online schemes.",
      "Werfel said the agency is adding more resources to the issue and streamlining identity theft cases by distinguishing between complex and simpler cases to resolve taxpayer issues faster.",
      "Among other recommendations, the taxpayer advocate is calling on Congress to expand the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear refund cases, give the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic program more financial leeway to help taxpayers and require the IRS to process claims for refund or credits in a timely manner.",
      "Collins said many IRS improvements, including faster service and quicker phone response times, have been made possible by multiyear funding provided by Congress. However, that funding is at risk of being cut.",
      "The federal tax collection agency originally received an $80 billion infusion of funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, though a 2023 debt ceiling and budget cut deal between Republicans and the Democratic White House resulted in $1.4 billion rescinded from the agency and a separate agreement to take $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years and divert those funds to other nondefense programs.",
      "Now, Treasury Department officials are calling on Congress to unlock another $20 billion in IRS enforcement money that is tied up in legislative language that has effectively rendered the money frozen.",
      "Werfel said the boost in the IRS budget \u201chas played an absolutely critical role\" in improvements to taxpayer services. \u201cWe\u2019ve put the money to good use,\" he said.",
      "If Congress does slash Inflation Reduction Act enforcement funding, Collins recommends that it not make cuts to taxpayer services and information technology. Congress should not, Collins said, \u201cinadvertently throw out the baby with the bathwater.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 09:26:59 -0500",
    "summary": "New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago",
    "story": [
      "New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago",
      "BOSTON -- The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right?",
      "Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises.",
      "Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average student attending an in-state public university this year faces a tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid. That's down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually, according to the data.",
      "That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt, down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures. And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by 17%, to $27,100.",
      "Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College Board. That's a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition increased 68%.",
      "Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off. Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma, according to research from Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions, said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board and lead author of the study.",
      "\u201cWe know that during COVID, a lot of institutions \u2014 public and private \u2014 froze tuition,\u201d Ma said.",
      "As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired, however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022.",
      "Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson's decision to attend Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old senior from Nevada.",
      "\u201cI originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the best option,\u201d said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school.",
      "Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years.",
      "Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data.",
      "\u201cInstitutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states\u2019 efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting \u2014 as much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and lower-income students.",
      "Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall.",
      "Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under control.",

      "To fight inflation that hit four-decade highs two and a half years ago, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation came down \u2014 from 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.7% in November, allowing the Fed to start cutting rates. But progress on inflation has stalled in recent months, and year-over-year consumer price increases are stuck above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "In December, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate for the third time in 2024, but the central bank\u2019s policymakers signaled that they\u2019re likely to be more cautious about future rate cuts. They projected just two in 2025, down from the four they had envisioned in September.",

I would love to be able to retire by the time I\u2019m 30,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be someone who lives with regret. I don\u2019t want to be angry at somebody or whatever. You just have to get on with your life, and that\u2019s what I decided to do.\u201d",
      "The siblings are not on speaking terms. Caroline was not at Wembley to see her brother's big victory.",
      "\u201cDaniel hasn\u2019t come to any of my last four fights, and yet no one asks him that question. He\u2019s not at this fight \u2014 he won\u2019t be at the next fight,\u201d she said.",
      "Caroline Dubois was upgraded to WBC lightweight champion a month ago after Katie Taylor vacated the belt.",
      "\u201cI believe I\u2019m the best 135-pounder in the division,\" Dubois said. \u201cIf everything goes smoothly, which I believe it can and will, I think I\u2019ll be undisputed by the end of this year.\u201d",
      "Beatriz Ferreira of Brazil holds the IBF belt and England's Terri Harper is the WBO champion. The WBA belt is vacant.",
      "A southpaw, Dubois wants Harper next and hopes to do it as part of the all-female event scheduled for March 7 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Like Saturday's card, it's a Boxxer and Sky Sports show, following their 2022 all-female event in London that Sky said had a TV audience of more than 2 million in the U.K. and Ireland.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to get, hopefully, Terri Harper for the all-female show,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see how this fight goes \u2014 it\u2019s going to make a big impact on who is willing to jump in next.\u201d",
      "The 27-year-old Daniel Dubois hopes to become the undisputed champion in his division, too. After Oleksandr Usyk retained his three heavyweight belts by beating Tyson Fury last month, Dubois interrupted Usyk\u2019s postfight interview to demand a rematch from their 2023 fight that Usyk won by knockout.",
      "Last year, the Fundora siblings beat the Dubois duo to the milestone of first sister and brother to hold titles at the same time. Gabriela Fundora is the flyweight champion and brother Sebastian is a light middleweight title holder. Both are coached by their father, Freddy.",
      "As a young girl, Caroline Dubois would watch older brother Daniel in the ring. She also became obsessed with middleweight greats like Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvelous Marvin Hagler.",
      "\u201cI loved it. I really learned boxing and wanted to try it out,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked my dad at 9 years old \u2018Can I do it?\u2019 He kept thinking about it and turning me down because the club that he was at was a boys boxing club. Eventually he was like 'OK I\u2019ll take you to the gym\u2019 and it just kicked off from there.",
      "\u201cWhen I went there, I had to pretend to be a boy \u2014 Colin. That happened for about six months until I got a fight.\u201d",
      "Home-schooled until age 11, she switched into secondary school and five years later was boxing for \u201cTeam GB\u201d and traveling to different countries for tournaments.",
      "Dubois lost in the quarterfinals of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and a year later had her first pro fight.",
      "Camara (14-4, 3 KOs) traveled to South Korea last April and beat a previously undefeated fighter, Choi Hyun-mi, via split decision.",
      "Dubois isn\u2019t worried about an upset.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that she\u2019s coming off a good win, it makes (Saturday\u2019s) fight more relevant,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good name to have as my first title defense.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a threat if I\u2019m not ready, but unfortunately (for her) I\u2019m ready.\u201d",

      "Espy died on Jan. 4 at age 81 after a brief illness.",
      "Espy, a Democrat, broke racial barriers as the first Black person to serve as president pro tem of the city council in the capital, Columbus, for most of the 1980s and as minority leader of the Ohio Senate, where he served from 1991 to 2000.",
      "Though his hopes of attaining higher office were ultimately dashed, Espy continued to earn honors from members of both parties throughout his career.",
      "Then- Democratic Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann tapped Espy as his top lieutenant in 2007 and chose Espy in 2009 to lead a high-profile internal investigation into allegations of sexual harassment at the office. The final report was damning.",
      "\u201cI don't think anyone anywhere is going to question Ben Espy's integrity,\" Dann\u2019s spokesperson, Leo Jennings, remarked at the time.",
      "Two years later, Republican Maureen O'Connor invited Espy to deliver the keynote address at her swearing-in ceremony as Ohio's first female chief justice.",
      "Espy's most lasting efforts were probably in the city of Columbus.",
      "He established the city's Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration, now one of the nation's largest, as well as the Columbus Youth Corps, a program teaching ethics and professionalism to young people that was designated as one of President George H.W. Bush's \u201cpoints of light.\u201d",
      "He also created \u201cThe Job Show,\u201d a cable program produced by the city that helped people find jobs. It was named the best municipal cable program in the U.S. in 1986 and 1987.",
      "\u201cHe was the community\u2019s person,\" daughter Laura Espy-Bell said. \"We\u2019re hearing countless stories of people whose lives were changed because of my dad.\u201d",

He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1965 with a bachelor's in political science and went on to earn a law degree from Howard University in 1968.",
      "Espy began his legal career as a corporate lawyer for Allegheny Airlines and then entered the U.S. Air Force, serving as an assistant staff judge advocate. He returned to Ohio in 1972, where he began the first of his stints at the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s office before starting his own law practice and eventually entering politics.",
      "He and his wife, Kathy Duffy Espy, who died in 2022, had four daughters and 11 grandchildren. Espy-Bell said that by day her father worked hard for the community, but at night he always had time to read a bedtime story to his daughters or attend his grandchildren's soccer games.",
      "Espy was involved in a freak accident in 1984 in which he was struck by a falling cornice that broke off an aging building in downtown Columbus as he walked by. He lost the lower part of his right leg.",

      "\u201cTwo things got him through that,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was the strength of my mother to carry our family through, raising four little girls. The other was the strength of my father, in his resiliency, to come back even stronger and even better.\u201d",
      "Derrick Clay, president and CEO of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, said Espy's story \u201creminds us all that challenges can become opportunities to make an even greater impact.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jim Harbaugh\u2019s football philosophy is rooted in being physical on both sides of the ball and wearing down an opponent",
      "EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Jim Harbaugh\u2019s football philosophy is rooted in being physical on both sides of the ball and wearing down an opponent.",
      "However, when it comes to relating to his players, it is nothing but love, respect and adulation.",
      "Like he did with the San Francisco 49ers and the University of Michigan, Harbaugh has turned around the fortunes of the Los Angeles Chargers. The Bolts finished 11-6 in the regular season \u2014 a six-win improvement \u2014 and are back in the playoffs, where they will face the Houston Texans on Saturday in an AFC wild-card round game.",
      "\u201cI just pretty much take on the personality of the team wherever I go,\u201d Harbaugh said earlier this season. \u201cThe love Derwin James has for football, I gravitated to that immediately. The humble warrior Khalil Mack is, everything about Justin Herbert. The toughness, competitiveness and confidence of our players, I want to take on a little bit of that. I want a lot of that in my personality and in my life to keep going. It\u2019s infectious.\u201d",
      "Harbaugh made an early impression on his new team. He participated in conditioning drills with players during offseason workouts. He also had players\u2019 hometowns and recruiting rankings on their nameplates in the locker room to show how everyone got to the NFL.",
      "Before the Sept. 8 opener against Las Vegas, players received a blue-collar work shirt from Harbaugh with an embroidered name patch and the Chargers lightning bolt logo. The shirts looked like those worn by filing station attendants and mechanics. Harbaugh said the shirts for him paid homage to his grandfather, Joe Cipiti, who worked in filling stations and was a self-taught mechanic who ended up teaching automobile mechanics at a trade school in Cleveland, but also to members of players' families who worked in the same type of jobs.",
      "\u201cI feel like that galvanized the team a lot because growing up as a kid, I saw a lot of people in the community who were hard workers. They always had that nameplate and always represented who that person was,\u201d James said. \u201cJust to have that means a lot to us.\u201d",
      "Harbaugh has continued the motivational gifts throughout the season.",
      "After a 17-13 victory over the Falcons on Dec. 1, players received a black metal lunch pail with their names and one of Harbaugh\u2019s favorite words \u2014 stalwart \u2014 on the front. There were also sweatshirts with the date and score after the Chargers 34-27 victory over the Bengals in a prime-time game on Nov. 17 and the 40-7 win at New England on Dec. 28 that wrapped up a playoff spot.",
      "\u201cTo some people, it may seem cheesy, but I enjoy those life gifts,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s been helping to set the culture. We wouldn\u2019t be in the postseason without all the details and stuff we\u2019ve done doing.\u201d",
      "Offensive coordinator Greg Roman, who was also on Harbaugh\u2019s staff at Stanford and San Francisco, said the area where Harbaugh has evolved the most has been relating his experiences as a player or a coach.",
      "Roman said the stories from Harbaugh\u2019s 15-year playing career or previous coaching stops can help reinforce the message at different points of the season.",
      "Harbaugh\u2019s stories \u2014 and there have been plenty \u2014 still resonate. Players still mention Harbaugh telling the story of remembering the day he was born on the first day of training camp as one of their favorites.",
      "\u201cThis thing is always changing with the mood of the team; what just happened, and where are we in the season? I think it can create some great perspective and bring them into one vision instead of reading a line item on the PowerPoint,\u201d Roman said. \u201cWith Jim, he has an art to his storytelling. There\u2019s always a moral to the stories, always, like one of those After School specials when you were a kid.\"",
      "The player Harbaugh might have had the most enormous effect on is Herbert. Harbaugh has been Herbert\u2019s biggest supporter from the time he was hired and catches passes from his quarterback during pregame warmups.",
      "Harbaugh also spends plenty of time in the quarterback room watching film with Herbert.",
      "\u201cThe things we\u2019ve learned from him ... I can\u2019t tell you how much. So it\u2019s cool to be able to share that and learn from him,\u201d Herbert said.",
      "NaVorro Bowman, who played for Harbaugh in San Francisco, has developed more of an appreciation for Harbaugh now that he is on his coaching staff with the Chargers.",
      "Bowman knew Harbaugh loved football, but now he gets to see how much on a daily basis.",
      "\u201cNow I understand why he\u2019s so good at what he does. He doesn\u2019t waste a minute. I mean, if he can squeeze out everything in a minute, he will squeeze it out,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to see or pay attention to it while playing. But now I understand why he\u2019s so successful is because work is what he loves to do.\u201d",
      "Bowman also sees many similarities in the Chargers and the 2011 49ers, who went from 6-10 to 13-3 and reached the NFC championship game before losing to the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cNo one expected us to be where we are today, and the only way that happened is because everyone here treats everyone with respect, respects each other\u2019s space, and grinds,\u201d he said.",

      "The NFL has moved the Rams\u2019 wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings to Arizona after days of devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The NFL has moved the Rams' wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings to Arizona after days of devastating wildfires in the Los Angeles area.",
      "The game will be played Monday night at State Farm Stadium, the home of the Arizona Cardinals, in suburban Glendale.",
      "The league announced the decision Thursday, a few hours after yet another fire broke out in an area several miles from the Rams' training complex in the Woodland Hills neighborhood. The Rams canceled the post-practice media availability for their players to allow everyone to get home quickly.",
      "In a brief statement, the league said the decision was made \u201cin the interest of public safety.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles has been besieged by multiple wildfires all week following two days of extraordinary wind across the vast metropolitan area. The newest fire triggered an evacuation order in West Hills, a suburban neighborhood directly northwest of the Rams' complex. The Kenneth Fire ballooned in size \u2014 charring over a square mile \u2014 within hours of igniting.",
      "More than 10,000 structures burned in the two largest fires, the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades and the Eaton Fire near Pasadena.",
      "While none of the fires was burning near SoFi Stadium in Inglewood \u2014 which is southwest of downtown Los Angeles \u2014 the NFL opted to move the game amid concerns about air quality, the strain put on the community and the possible demands on police and fire department personnel.",
      "The Rams and the Los Angeles Chargers \u2014 who will play a wild-card game at Houston on Saturday \u2014 both practiced outdoors this week, but both teams' coaches were concerned about the air quality, with Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh cutting his players' normal outdoor time in half.",
      "The Rams will travel to Phoenix on Friday after their early-afternoon practice in Woodland Hills, the team confirmed late Thursday. They will hold practice Saturday at the Cardinals\u2019 complex in Tempe.",
      "The Los Angeles area will be at a high fire risk through Friday, the National Weather Service announced.",
      "A few hours before the Kenneth Fire broke out near the Rams' training complex, coach Sean McVay said he was optimistic the game could be played at SoFi Stadium as scheduled, while realizing uncertainty was unavoidable.",
      "\u201cWe would like to be able to play the game at home in front of our fans,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way that we\u2019re operating, but I can\u2019t control when that decision will be made. ... If it\u2019s not in LA, then the game will still be played, and we\u2019ve got to be able to get ready for that.\u201d",
      "Game relocations are very rare in the NFL, but not unprecedented.",
      "In 2003, the league moved a Monday night regular-season game between the Chargers and Dolphins from San Diego to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe to avoid wildfires in Southern California.",
      "The Rams had a Monday night game against Kansas City relocated from Mexico City to Los Angeles in 2018 because of concerns about the playing surface at Azteca Stadium, and McVay cited that experience as part of his preparation for the uncertainty created this week.",
      "\u201cYou acknowledge these things, but you also want to make sure that how you can control making sure that you\u2019re doing the right things is preparing accordingly, while also being mindful that this is bigger than football,\u201d McVay said. \u201cIf people you\u2019re directly involved with are affected, you\u2019re making sure you\u2019re tending to that first.\u201d",
      "The relocation won't have much effect on the traveling Vikings, while the Rams weren't overly concerned about missing out on the comforts of home. Like most NFL teams, the Rams stay in a hotel on the night before home games to ensure a restful night of sleep.",
      "Before the Kenneth Fire broke out, McVay said no Rams players or coaches had been forced to move or had lost anything to the fire, although some team personnel had been affected.",
      "\u201cWe've lost power where I am for a couple of days,\" quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \u201cWe've been lucky in that regard, that (loss of) power is the worst thing that's happened to us. Obviously it's a tough thing to watch on the news, to be around, to see. Driving around, seeing all that, it's just really sad to see what's going on. A bunch of people (are) doing everything they possibly can to try and get things under control and get people back to normal as quickly as possible.\u201d",

      "Ohio State and Texas are both seeking a chance to end national title droughts",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- There is still a sense for some Ohio State players that they haven't done anything yet, even after winning twice already this postseason to get into the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Texas.",
      "\"Absolutely. I have been here for four years, and I have absolutely no hardware to show for it,\" receiver Emeka Egbuka said. \u201cThat\u2019s really on the forefront of our minds.\u201d",
      "While Ohio State is the only school to appear in four of the last six CFPs, all since Ryan Day became head coach, and won four consecutive Big Ten titles from 2017-20 before Egbuka and most of the current players arrived, the Buckeyes' last national championship was 10 years ago. That was the first season of the four-team College Football Playoff, when they won the title at AT&T Stadium, the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys where they play the in-state Longhorns (13-2).",
      "The winner Friday night advances to the national title game in Atlanta on Jan. 20.",
      "Ohio State (12-2) is the No. 8 seed now favored to win the national title after two lopsided playoff wins: 42-17 at home against Tennessee before a dominating 41-21 win over undefeated Big Ten champion and top seed Oregon in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just fighting to get another opportunity to play with each other,\u201d said linebacker and captain Cody Simon, one of nine Ohio State players still around from 2020. \u201cThat's our biggest motivator right now. ... We don't want to end this run right now.\"",
      "Texas last won the national title 19 years ago, and didn't make its CFP debut until last season as the Big 12 champion. Coach Steve Sarkisian's Longhorns are now the last team standing for the SEC, the only league to be represented in the semifinals each year \u2014 and has six of the last nine national champions.",
      "The 15 games for the Longhorns, who played in the SEC championship game before wins over Clemson and Big 12 champ Arizona State, are already one more than they had ever played in a single season.",
      "\"I like the new playoff dynamic. It\u2019s fun,\u201d Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obsessed with finishing up,\u201d said Longhorns All-America senior cornerback Jahdae Barron. \u201cBut we\u2019re obsessed with being enamored with us, and giving every day the respect that it deserves. And just being loving to one another and having a level bond with one another and continuing to build the culture.\u201d",
      "Ohio State quarterback Will Howard and Ewers both won Big 12 championships the last time they played at AT&T Stadium.",
      "Texas was the Big 12 champ last season. Howard transferred to Ohio State from Kansas State, which two years ago beat CFP-bound and undefeated TCU in overtime for that league title.",
      "Howard started three games against Texas while with the Wildcats. Those were all losses, as was a fourth game when he was on the sideline.",
      "The best matchup of the game could be Barron vs Buckeyes freshman receiver Jeremiah Smith. The 5-foot-11, 200-pound Barron won the Thorpe Award as the nation\u2019s top defensive back. But Barron gives up four inches and 15 pounds to Smith, the second-team All-American who may be the most electric freshman in the country. Smith has 70 receptions for 1,224 yards and 14 touchdowns. Smith has four touchdowns in these playoffs.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big baller. Strong,\u201d Barron said. \u201cHe\u2019s a physical player, and I\u2019ll have to be physical.\u201d",
      "In its two losses to Georgia this season, Texas struggled to protect Ewers and surrendered 13 sacks. Now the Longhorns face a Buckeyes defensive front that sacked Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel eight times in the Rose Bowl. Jack Sawyer and J.T. Tuimoloau each had two sacks in that game.

      "Even though he was wearing a sling on his left arm, Trevor Lawrence was able to point plenty of fingers \u2014 most of them at himself",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Even though he was wearing a sling on his left arm, Trevor Lawrence was able to point plenty of fingers on Thursday \u2014 most of them at himself.",
      "The Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback spoke publicly for the first time since having season-ending shoulder surgery that came after he had recovered from a violent, concussion-inducing hit. His availability came three days after team owner Shad Khan fired coach Doug Pederson and kept oft-criticized general manager Trent Baalke.",
      "Lawrence agreed with Khan\u2019s assessment that the offense was too predictable and made it clear that the Jaguars (4-13) need more toughness and a better culture under their next head coach.",
      "\u201cWe need to get some juice back in this place,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve lost that in the past year and a half or so, for whatever reason. We got to get that back. And I think that\u2019s something that us as leaders on the team really have to look at.",
      "\u201cWe have to take our part, too. This isn\u2019t just we fired Coach Peterson, so that\u2019s all on him. That\u2019s on us as players, too. We have to get that energy back. \u2026 We have to be the ones to really change our trajectory, to be honest.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars have requested interviews with 10 potential replacements, a list that includes five current NFL coordinators and three former head coaches. Jacksonville released an eight-man list Tuesday but have since added Minnesota defensive coordinator Brian Flores and Kansas City defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.",
      "Joe Brady (Buffalo), Liam Coen (Tampa Bay), Aaron Glenn (Detroit), Patrick Graham (Las Vegas), Ben Johnson (Detroit), Todd Monken (Baltimore), Kellen Moore (Kellen Moore) and Robert Saleh (Green Bay) also are on the list.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we are doing all the right things as far as talking to all the right people and all the big-name candidates that are out there,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cI don\u2019t know any of those people personally, really. So \u2026 I don\u2019t necessarily have an opinion.\u201d",
      "Lawrence does have a preference, though.",
      "\u201cObviously I\u2019m biased. I\u2019m an offensive guy. I\u2019m a quarterback,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cFrom that standpoint, sounds great having a young offensive coach that can bring the system in and that we can just grow together and have that system in place for years to come.\u201d",
      "The part that would help the most: Lawrence staying healthy.",
      "Lawrence was carted off the field in early December after Houston's Azeez Al-Shaair delivered a forearm to his facemask, a late hit that caused two sideline-clearing brawls.",
      "The unsportsmanlike blow left Lawrence in the fencing position \u2014 a common response to a traumatic brain injury in which both fists clench \u2014 and he stayed on the ground for several minutes while a melee ensued nearby.",
      "Lawrence said, \u201cI don\u2019t think the hit was right,\u201d and added that Al-Shaair has yet to reach out.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think personally attacking the guy is the right answer,\u201d Lawrence said.",
      "It was the latest injury for Lawrence, who missed a game in 2023 because of a sprained right shoulder. He also missed significant practice time that season because of a sprained left knee, a sprained right ankle and a concussion two weeks later.",
      "He now has missed eight games over two years and surely will be labeled as injury-prone moving forward.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d said Lawrence, who threw for 2,045 yards in 10 games this season, with 11 touchdown passes and seven interceptions. \u201cI just want to stay healthy. What bothers me is not being out there, so I\u2019m not really worried about any labels or tags or anything.",
      "\u201cI just want to be out there. I feel like I know I can impact the game and help us win games when I\u2019m out there. And when I\u2019m not, it\u2019s tough.\u201d",
      "Lawrence will be in the sling for three more weeks and expects to be back on the field for organized team activities in May. In the meantime, he will wait for Khan and Baalke to land Lawrence his third head coach in five years.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s an offensive coach or a defensive coach, just a guy that\u2019s going to instill that culture, that toughness into our team and that confidence that it doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re playing, when we\u2019re playing, just spot the ball and we can beat anybody,\" Lawrence said. \"Just a tough team that other teams don\u2019t want to play against.\u201d",

      "The Dubuque Fighting Saints of the United States Hockey League will raise Gaudreau\u2019s No. 8 to the rafters on Saturday with the brothers\u2019 parents, Guy and Jane, sisters Katie and Kristen, and Johnny\u2019s widow, Meredith, scheduled to be in attendance at the arena in eastern Iowa.",
      "\u201cIt was an honor befitting of his contribution to the organization and also obviously the sad circumstances that happened,\u201d Fighting Saints part owner Peter Luukko told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cHe was one of the better players in the history of the team.\u201d",
      "Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau died Aug. 29 when they were struck by an SUV while riding bicycles on a rural New Jersey road near their hometown of Carneys Point. The driver charged with killing them pleaded not guilty earlier this week after turning down a prosecution offer of 35 years in prison.",
      "Gaudreau's No. 8 \u2014 not the No. 13 he is better known for wearing while playing at Boston College, in the NHL with the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets and internationally while representing the U.S. \u2014 will be the first retired in franchise history. Gaudreau was Dubuque's leading scorer the season he played there (2010-11) and led it to winning the Clark Cup as USHL champions.",
      "\u201cWhen we were assembling the team that first year, we looked for players with a high hockey IQ and compete level who came from good families,\u201d said Jim Montgomery, who coached three seasons in Dubuque before moving on to the University of Denver and the NHL's Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins and now the St. Louis Blues. \u201cJohnny was the epitome of those qualities. He was a uniquely gifted player who came from an equally special family. It\u2019s only fitting that the Fighting Saints retire his number as no other player could be his equal.\u201d",
      "Managing partner Brad Kwong said in a statement that he hopes Gaudreau's number hanging in the rafters \"will be an inspiration to every young hockey player who plays in this arena and particularly to those players who suit up for the Fighting Saints. His enthusiastic spirit and love for the game will forever be present.\u201d",
      "Also expected at the ceremony is USHL Commissioner Glenn Hefferan, who will announce the Gaudreau Award to be given to a player who embodies Johnny and Matthew's qualities of excellence in hockey, spirit of the game, and care and responsibility. The Fighting Saints will donate proceeds from their 50/50 drawing during their game against the Sioux City Musketeers to the John and Matthew Gaudreau Foundation, which will fund an adaptive playground at a school for kids with disabilities in South Jersey.",
      "\"We have to remember each other, support each other,\" said Luukko, a former NHL executive whose sons Nick and Max played hockey growing up in the Philadelphia area at the same time as Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community, and you don\u2019t want to ever forget those who came before you, whether it\u2019s a veteran player or for something as tragic as the accident with the Gaudreau brothers.\u201d",
      "Johnny Gaudreau in 2018 became a minority owner in the club as part of Saints4Life Acquisitions LLC, a group including Luukko, NHL player Zemgus Girgensons and Stanley Cup-winning coach Dan Bylsma.",

      "Szabo said Wycheck loved football and his teammates. She said he fought for years after retiring to bring attention to the symptoms and struggles he knew stemmed from CTE, feeling too often ignored and helpless. Szabo said she wishes her family had been educated on CTE symptoms to know what to look for and now hope for increased intervention, education and support for NFL alumni and their families.",
      "\u201cInstead of believing that something was inherently wrong with him, we now know he was doing the best he could as a father and friend under circumstances beyond his control,\u201d Szabo said.",
      "Madison Wycheck Nowell said she worried daily about her father when he retired, whether he was eating, drinking enough water or making his appointments. She said they saw his health rapidly decline and hope this is a cautionary tale.",
      "\u201cMy dad explained that it felt like his brain had a thick brick wall inside that stopped his will to follow through with anything, no matter what it was or who was involved,\u201d Nowell said in her statement. \u201cRegardless of his CTE symptoms, I will always believe that God intervened to allow him the opportunity to enjoy our weddings, his grandkids, and all other things he truly wanted to be a part of before he left us.\u201d",
      "Wednesday was the 25th anniversary of the Music City Miracle, a lateral from Wycheck to Kevin Dyson that led to a touchdown on the kickoff return and rallied the Titans over Buffalo in an AFC wild-card game.",
      "That TD return ranked fourth among the NFL\u2019s greatest plays over the league\u2019s first 100 years.",

      "He lived in fear of dying for nearly four months in 2023 until doctors discovered a lesion on his brain, on a tract that caused unfounded fears. They cut a hole the size of a baseball in his head to remove as much of the tumor as they could. He is making progress as he starts a new year.",
      "Woodland was among dozens of players, caddies and tour officials who stood along the shores east of Waikiki to celebrate Murray in a solemn ceremony Tuesday morning. It reminded him of a moment with Murray that taught him the impact players can have without even knowing it.",
      "They played together in the final round of the PGA Championship, just six days before Murray died. Woodland said a man in the gallery was following them and yelling at Murray to get his attention. For the longest time, they ignored him.",
      "\u201cFinally, Grayson looked over and the guy broke down and started crying and thanked Grayson for how open he was about his struggles and everything. The guy was sober now. He was getting into golf because of Grayson. He heard Grayson\u2019s story,\u201d Woodland said.",
      "\u201cI thought maybe Grayson made him mad. He was yelling \u2014 \u2018Grayson, Grayson\u2019 \u2014 time after time. We were laughing about it talking, and then Grayson looked, and it was beautiful.\u201d",
      "Woodland took a message away from that.",
      "\u201cGrayson was helping people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I'll remember that.\u201d",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes a discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "Woodland, best known for his U.S. Open victory at Pebble Beach in 2019, is reminded of that as he tries to get back to full strength from September 2023 brain surgery.",
      "He was so grateful when he played the Sony Open last year in his first tournament back. He continues to speak openly about details of his recovery. He is not entirely out of the woods.",
      "Murray's father, Eric, held back tears as he spoke about the PGA Tour as a family in helping them get through the tragedy, and launch the Grayson Murray Foundation to help others coping with mental health and addiction.",
      "\u201cNot everyone has the support systems that a lot of us have out here, and I\u2019m very blessed to have a big team around me,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cThere\u2019s people battling and going through a lot of stuff that don\u2019t have that. So I\u2019ve been open because I want people to know, who are going through something that\u2019s hard, that you\u2019re not alone in this, that I\u2019m out here playing. I\u2019m playing, living a dream, but I\u2019m struggling, too.\u201d",
      "He has seen the effect in messages from fans, and the occasions when people approach him to share how much inspiration they get from seeing Woodland play.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had grown men come up to me crying that they\u2019ve been battling brain tumors or battling stuff, and seeing me out here playing again gives them hope,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to do that. At the end of the day, I want to have a positive impact in this world. I\u2019d like to have a positive impact on myself playing golf, and I\u2019d like to have a positive impact on my family.\u201d",
      "It hasn't been easy.",
      "There were times he would drive in a city and recognize a place where he had to pull over and call his wife because he thought he was going to die. He stayed in a hotel where he remembered having seizures.",
      "\u201cEverything was new, and it was hard,\u201d he said.",
      "He had hit rock bottom in July at the 3M Open in Minnesota, when all those fears of dying returned. That led to more searching, more specialists, until they realized the scans were good and he needed to find a way to slow his brain.",
      "The golf slowly improved. He has reunited with famed Dallas swing coach Randy Smith. And he figured out some steps that kept his brain from being too stimulated. That led to more quality time at home with his wife and three children.",
      "Woodland does breathing exercises before he gets out of bed and before he goes to sleep, along with yoga and meditation, all geared toward allowing him to slow his brain.",
      "He has seen big improvement \u2014 he had his best two finishes late last year \u2014 and starts this new season more encouraged than ever. And he continues to share his struggles, which he finds important. He saw the value through Murray at the PGA, and from his own experiences.",
      "\u201cGolf is something that I do. It\u2019s not who I am. It gives me a platform. It gives me an opportunity to chase my dreams and do something that I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve realized through this process that I\u2019m something a lot more than a golfer. I\u2019m obviously a father, a husband. I have an opportunity to leave this world a better place than I found it, and I\u2019m trying to do everything I can to give back to people that are struggling. Because if you\u2019re ever feeling alone in that moment, it sucks. And it\u2019s hard.\u201d",

      "To start, Marvin Mims Jr. was counted on mostly as a returner",
      "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- To start, Marvin Mims Jr. was counted on mostly as a returner. Then, some receiver reps were thrown in. Now, he\u2019s also spending time in the Denver Broncos' backfield.",
      "Anything to get the ball into Mims' hands more, so he can show off those fast feet.",
      "The speedy returner/receiver/runner has become a dynamic, multifaceted threat for the playoff-bound Broncos \u2014 a game-changer on special teams and as part of the Bo Nix-led offense.",
      "\u201cIt puts a lot of stress on (the defense),\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said of Mims\u2019 versatility as the Broncos (10-7) prepare for their AFC wild-card round game Sunday at Buffalo (13-4). \u201cHe\u2019s a talented player, and you have to get creative sometimes to get him the ball. It\u2019s been working out well.\u201d",
      "The second-year player out of Oklahoma recently was named to the Pro Bowl squad as a return specialist for the second straight season. That's elite territory, with the only other player in Broncos history to be named to the Pro Bowl in each of his first two seasons being Von Miller, the talented pass rusher who\u2019s now tormenting quarterbacks for the Bills.",
      "\u201cAny time I can be recognized in the same stat as him, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mims said.",
      "The Broncos view Mims as their version of Cordarrelle Patterson, the longtime do-everything player now with the Pittsburgh Steelers. A facsimile, too, of San Francisco 49ers wideout Deebo Samuel.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see the growth that you hope you see in a player in his second year,\u201d coach Sean Payton said of Mims. \u201cWe saw it right away as a returner a year ago, and we saw spurts. So it always just takes me back to, \u2018Are we doing things? Can we find a role?\u2019\u201d",
      "They've been patient not to heap too much on Mims too fast. Although, he's ready for any wrinkle in the playbook.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s just memorization for the most part,\u201d Mims said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just being a playmaker and making plays (in) a certain situation. It\u2019s never just picture perfect. At the end of the day, you just have to take what\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "As a receiver this season, Mims has 39 catches for 503 yards and six touchdowns. That includes two each in the last two games of the season, one of them a spectacular grab between two defenders on fourth down that sent Denver's game at Cincinnati into overtime two weeks ago.",
      "In the backfield, he\u2019s carried the ball 13 times for 42 yards.",
      "But his real specialty remains punt returns, where he had a league-leading 15.7-yard average, marking the first time a Broncos player has led the NFL in that category since Rick Upchurch averaged 16.1 yards in 1982.",
      "\u201cI love being a punt returner. I feel like there are so many plays to be made at punt return,\u201d said Mims, who's also returned seven kicks for a 27.7-yard average. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite thing that I get to do.\u201d",
      "He nearly broke a punt return this season against Indianapolis, cutting across the field and sprinting along the sideline for 61 yards in the fourth quarter of a game the Broncos trailed. It set up a go-ahead touchdown in a must-win game that propelled Denver toward its first playoff berth in nine seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been such an asset for us,\u201d special teams coordinator Ben Kotwica said. \u201cThe punt return element, he\u2019s been exceptional again this year.\u201d",
      "Mims knows the uplifting power that a punt return has on the team because receiver Courtland Sutton reminds him all the time.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s 10 yards, it\u2019s such a big momentum change for us,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cJust to see him running with the ball \u2014 he\u2019s an exciting guy with the ball in his hands \u2014 and watching him go down the sidelines a couple times, it\u2019s exciting because at any moment you know that he could take it to the crib.\u201d",
      "Mims' big receiving games this season include not only an eight-catch, two-touchdown performance at Cincinnati, but a 93-yard TD reception from Nix in a win over Cleveland.",
      "\u201cIt was one of those awesome plays that you don\u2019t get often,\u201d Nix said. \u201cBut they\u2019re pretty fun.\u201d",
      "A bigger stage now awaits at Buffalo.",
      "\u201cI like where we\u2019re at right now,\u201d Mims said. \u201cBuffalo has had a great year and, deservingly so, has the second seed. Going up to play them is going to be a tough challenge \u2014 a really good football team \u2014 but I\u2019m real confident in this group.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 09:22:27 -0500",

      "It was some combination of religion, a grudge involving Knute Rockne and a rival, and maybe the simple time-honored notion that some people just don\u2019t like Notre Dame",
      "DANIA BEACH, Fla. -- It was some combination of religion, a grudge involving Knute Rockne and maybe the simple notion that some people just don't like Notre Dame.",
      "Back in the 1920s, the Fighting Irish made what might have been their biggest push to join what would become the Big Ten but the athletic director at Michigan blocked it. Ever since, Notre Dame has been an independent \u2014 an increasingly rare iconoclast as college athletics becomes more controlled by mega-conferences almost by the day.",
      "How's that working out for the Irish?",
      "Well, instead of splitting the $14 million they've earned by reaching the semifinals of the College Football Playoff \u2014 the way Thursday's opponent Penn State of the Big Ten must \u2014 they've pocketed every penny.",
      "Notre Dame might not have the voice of the Southeastern Conference or Big Ten when it comes to the big-time decisions guiding this sport, but it has a seat at the table, along with another $12 million starting in 2026 \u2014 also unsplit with a league \u2014 simply for being part of this arrangement.",
      "\u201cFor people at Notre Dame, it's a point of differentiation,\u201d said John Heisler, the longtime sports information guru who has written 10 books on the Irish. \u201cAnd it's just not something that anybody in South Bend really wants to give up on.\u201d",
      "It wasn't always that way. As far back as 1899, Notre Dame was looking to be admitted into what was about to become the Big Nine. That time, it essentially got passed over in favor of Iowa and Indiana.",
      "A generation later, in 1926, Rockne, then coaching the Fighting Irish, tried again to bring Notre Dame into the Big Ten.",
      "Michigan's athletic director, Fielding Yost, led the move to block the Irish \u2014 a move that, depending on what you read, came because he was anti-Catholic or involved in a feud with the Notre Dame legend that dated back more than a decade.",
      "Either way, Notre Dame was left out and the Fighting Irish and Michigan, just a three-hour drive apart, didn't play from 1910-1941.",
      "Michigan and other schools' refusal to play the team in South Bend, Indiana, opened opportunities Notre Dame still takes advantage of to this day.",
      "The Fighting Irish have played USC every year since 1926. They have annual meetings with Army and Navy, and have played Stanford most years since 1988. More recently, they signed a deal that fills out their schedule with five games against Atlantic Coast Conference teams each season.",
      "In today's world, where cable, streaming and social media allow for every team to market themselves as a national product, that might not sound revolutionary. Decades ago, it was.",
      "\u201cI think the feeling was, if Notre Dame would have just wanted to be a Midwest institution, they would've joined the Big Ten a long time ago,\u201d Heisler said. \u201cBut that's not just the aspiration in terms of where their students in general come from, or where they recruit. They've always been very comfortable recruiting from all over the place.\u201d",
      "For decades, Notre Dame lived in a world where the big-name independent was not an anomaly. Miami, Pitt, Florida State and Syracuse were among them, as was this week's opponent, Penn State.",
      "In that atmosphere, the Fighting Irish went along with others in the 1970s and joined the College Football Association, which was established to maximize value for TV rights.",
      "By 1990, with the CFA's effectiveness as a TV market-maker in decline and Notre Dame football reaching a new golden era under Lou Holtz, the Fighting Irish in 1991 cut their own deal with NBC that, in many ways, was the first domino to fall on the multibillion-dollar road this sport is on today.",
      "The SEC expanded to 12 teams in 1992 and added what was then a revolutionary title game to cap off its season. Over the next three-plus decades, virtually every program got caught up in the mix of mega-conferences that, in turn, have helped shape the 12-team college playoff that debuted this season.",
      "Holding steady throughout, in part thanks to the NBC deal that runs through the 2029 season, has been Notre Dame. Even though the Irish haven't won the national title since 1988, their brand stayed strong enough to demand a spot in that playoff mix.",
      "One drawback is that, without a conference championship available to win, the Fighting Irish could not find an easier path to the title by earning a bye that goes to those league's champions.",
      "Another is that because the big conferences have generated such massive media rights, Notre Dame needs every penny it can get to stay competitive. Its football program has one of the nation's biggest budgets, at about $72 million a year, according to Sportico.",
      "\u201cWe view being independent as a positive thing,\" coach Marcus Freeman said. \"We sell it to our recruits as a positive thing. We know we can't play in a championship game and we can't have a first-round bye. But we continue to use not playing in Week 13 as our bye. In terms of the finances and the TV deals, I'd say that's another positive.\u201d",
      "More change is destined for college football, its playoff system and the conferences themselves.",
      "At the joint pregame news conference Wednesday, Penn State coach James Franklin opined about the need for more uniformity across all of college football \u2014 for one, to give the playoff selection committee a more \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison when sorting through teams to fill the bracket.",
      "\u201cThis is no knock at coach or Notre Dame, but I think everyone should be in a conference,\" Franklin said, before almost apologetically looking at Freeman on the other end of the table.",
      "Freeman said he doesn't have opinions as strong as Franklin's on the state of college football, and doesn't see the need for Notre Dame to someday be like everybody else.",
      "\u201cWe pride ourselves and our independence,\u201d the Fighting Irish coach said. \u201cIf they come out with a decision where they tell us we can't be independent, we'll make it work.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Hockey. Outdoors. In Florida.",
      "Next season, the NHL is making it happen \u2014 twice.",
      "The NHL announced Wednesday that the Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers will play host to the New York Rangers at loanDepot Park in Miami \u2014 home of baseball\u2019s Marlins \u2014 on Jan. 2, 2026, in the Winter Classic, with the Tampa Bay Lightning playing host to the Boston Bruins at Raymond James Stadium on Feb. 1, 2026, in a Stadium Series game.",
      "\u201cStanley Cups, strings of sellouts and the exponential growth of youth and high school hockey throughout the state have demonstrated that Florida is a hockey hotbed,\u201d NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. \u201cOutdoor NHL games in the Sunshine State? Never let it be said that our league isn\u2019t willing to accept a challenge.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a long time coming, but the Panthers and Lightning have represented the Eastern Conference in each of the last five Stanley Cup Finals and they've built heavily engaged fan bases. And both franchises have asked the NHL to bring an outdoor game \u2014 or two, in this case \u2014 to the Sunshine State for many years.",
      "The league listened.",
      "\u201cTo be able to celebrate these two franchises against great Original Six teams, I think, is phenomenal,\u201d Panthers President Matthew Caldwell said. \u201cAnd I think our time has come. We deserve that outdoor game and we\u2019re fired up to have it right here locally.\u201d",
      "The Marlins\u2019 ballpark, located about a 45-minute drive south of the Panthers' home arena in Sunrise, can hold about 37,000 fans. Raymond James Stadium \u2014 home of the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2014 can hold about 65,000 for most events, and capacity can be increased a bit if necessary.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited for this landmark event to finally arrive for Bolts Nation and the Tampa Bay community,\u201d Lightning CEO Steve Griggs said. \u201cThis moment has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re thrilled to see this dream become a reality.\u201d",
      "These will not be ordinary outdoor games.",
      "The high in Miami on Jan. 2 this year was 78. The high in Tampa last year on Feb. 1 was 66. Those temperatures aren't conducive to finding ice outside. And the high game-time temperature for any of the previous outdoor games in NHL history, the league said, was 65 for a game in Denver in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe understand it\u2019s risky,\" said Steve Mayer, the NHL's president of content and events. \"I think we like it. And it\u2019s not a challenge. It\u2019s actually an opportunity for us.\u201d",
      "The Marlins' loanDepot Park has a retractable roof and that will play a big role in getting that stadium ready for hockey. The air conditioning will be cranked up \u2014 way up \u2014 and the Panthers-Rangers game will be played at night with the roof open. For the Lightning-Bruins game inside the open-air stadium in Tampa, the NHL will build a temporary roof over the ice surface and remove it just a few hours before game time.",
      "\u201cWe want to bring a little bit of a winter wonderland to Florida,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "The games in 2026 will be the 44th and 45th regular-season outdoor contests in NHL history. The Rangers are 5-0-0 in their previous outdoor games, Boston has won four of its five outdoor games and the Lightning prevailed in their only outdoor contest. The Panthers have never played such a game.",
      "\u201cWe get to expand our great sport,\" Panthers general manager and hockey operations president Bill Zito said. \"We have a chance to have 100,000 people watching hockey live, outside, in Florida. That's unthinkable. And the exciting part and the fun part is it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s getting bigger. More and more people are becoming hockey fans in Florida.\"",

      "Former major league left-hander Brian Matusz has died",
      "BALTIMORE -- Brian Matusz, the left-handed pitcher who spent eight seasons in the major leagues, mostly with the Baltimore Orioles as they returned to prominence a decade ago, has died. He was 37.",
      "The Orioles and the University of San Diego announced Matusz\u2019s death Tuesday night, with USD saying it received word from Matusz\u2019s family. They did not announce a cause of death.",
      "\u201cOur hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole Brian Matusz,\u201d the Orioles said. \u201cA staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate, and always had a smile on his face.\"",
      "The Orioles drafted Matusz with the fourth overall pick in 2008 out of San Diego.",
      "\u201cBrian was one of the best players to ever wear a Torero uniform,\u201d San Diego coach Brock Ungricht said. \u201cHis dedication to the USD community and passion for the game of baseball were evident to all who knew him. Brian\u2019s unexpected passing leaves a void in our hearts, but his legacy will continue to inspire us, both on and off the field. We will forever be grateful for his friendship and unwavering support of San Diego baseball.\"",
      "Matusz made his major league debut in 2009 and was a starter until shifting to the bullpen down the stretch in 2012. That was the season Baltimore earned a wild card for its first postseason appearance in 15 years.",
      "In 2014, Matusz went 2-3 with a 3.48 ERA in 63 relief appearances as the Orioles won the AL East.",
      "Baltimore traded Matusz to Atlanta early in the 2016 season, and he eventually caught on with the Chicago Cubs, making one start for them that year in what would be his final big league appearance.",

      "If it seems as though the 2025 professional tennis year started pretty much immediately right after 2024 ended, that\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what happens in a sport where the offseason really does not leave players much time to be \u201coff.\u201d",
      "If it seems as though the 2025 professional tennis year started pretty much immediately right after 2024 ended, that\u2019s because that\u2019s exactly what happens in a sport where the offseason really does not leave players much time to be \u201coff.\u201d",
      "Actually, for tennis, 2025 began while the calendar still read 2024.",
      "\u201cI do, obviously, wish that the offseason was longer, 100%,\u201d said 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who began her \u201cyear\u201d by helping the American team win the United Cup title in Sydney, more than a week after that competition began on Dec. 27. \u201cBut it is what it is.\u201d",
      "When the Australian Open gets going Sunday morning in Melbourne (Saturday night EST), players will have tuned up by playing in various events that followed a period of practice and work in the gym that was longer for some than others.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there is even an offseason anymore,\u201d 2021 Wimbledon semifinalist Denis Shapovalov said. \u201cThe season is never-ending.\u201d",
      "For the record, last season officially and finally wrapped up for good on Dec. 22, when Brazil's Jo\u00e3o Fonseca won the ATP Next Gen Finals in Saudi Arabia. He was back on a court later in December for the Challenger Tour stop in Canberra, Australia \u2014 which he also won.",
      "The golf season is similar, essentially running non-stop, without the multiple months off offered by team sports.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, we (have been) fighting to have a longer offseason. To be healthy \u2026 you at least need a two-month offseason. So it would be great to finish a little bit earlier,\u201d said Conchita Martinez, a former player who won the 1994 Wimbledon championship and is now the coach of Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.",
      "\u201cFor the health of the tour, for the health of the players,\" Martinez said, \"maybe (the season) should be a little bit shorter.\u201d",
      "This is, to be sure, not a new concern.",
      "Yet nothing seems to have changed. If anything, the problem is becoming more pronounced.",
      "And to Martinez's point, the opening week of this season included two singles finals in which one player stopped playing \u2014 Naomi Osaka in Auckland, New Zealand, and Reilly Opelka in Brisbane, Australia \u2014 because of an injury concern (it's also likely they wanted to make sure not to push themselves too hard with the year's first Grand Slam tournament on the horizon).",
      "That's why, as much as possible, the athletes try to find some down time before getting ready to ramp up for what's to come.",
      "\u201cI had 1\u00bd weeks that I didn\u2019t touch the tennis racket. I just threw it in my room. I didn\u2019t want to see it again,\u201d four-time major champ Carlos Alcaraz joked. \u201cIt was really helpful to disconnect a little bit.\u201d",
      "They say they view the time between seasons, however brief it might be, as an opportunity for a combination of rest and relaxation \u2014 the Maldives is a popular vacation spot, as a glance at player' social media makes clear \u2014 along with training and preparation, with an eye on trying to improve in some way.",
      "\u201cYou take a bit of a break. But you need to get right back on the court and in the gym to get ready for Australia,\u201d said Jasmine Paolini, the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon in 2024. \u201cAs soon as you can, you need to practice, but there isn\u2019t a lot of time, so you have to figure out how to schedule things.\"",
      "Ben Shelton, a big server who was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and U.S. Open two years ago, spent time on his return game this offseason. He was representing the United States at the Davis Cup in Spain in late November, then playing an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in early December, before heading to his new home, Orlando, Florida, to get ready for January.",
      "Unlike many players, he skipped any competition in the first week of 2025, instead opting to enter an event in Auckland this week before heading to Melbourne.",
      "The mind-set, Shelton explains, amounts to: \u201cOh, I\u2019m six weeks off; I\u2019m not really \u2018match tough\u2019 right now.\"",
      "Some fans wonder why he and others opt to participate in exhibitions at all, but players say those don't take the same sort of toll that a day-after-day tournament, or even every-other-day Slam event, does. Hard to argue with someone choosing to make a little extra money on the side, too.",
      "And players make the case that no matter how much they can switch off in November or December, part of the issue is there are not many chances to do that during other months.",
      "\u201cIdeally we\u2019d have a little bit more time. It\u2019s such a short turnaround ... after such a long season. There\u2019s not enough days to recover,\u201d said Alexei Popyrin, an Australian who upset Novak Djokovic at last year's U.S. Open. \u201cTaking time off to let your body rest might hinder the preparation, but at the end of the day, you need your body to be ready. The schedule is just so hectic throughout the year.\u201d",

      "The law that could ban TikTok is coming before the Supreme Court",
      "WASHINGTON -- The law that could ban TikTok is coming before the Supreme Court on Friday, with the justices largely holding the app's fate in their hands.",
      "The popular social media platform says the law violates the First Amendment and should be struck down.",
      "TikTok's parent company is based in China, and the U.S. government says that means it is a potential national security threat. Chinese authorities could force it to hand over sensitive data on the huge number of Americans who use it or could influence the spread of information on the platform, they say.",
      "An appeals court has upheld the law, which bans TikTok unless it's sold.",
      "The law is set to take effect Jan. 19, the day before a new term begins for President-elect Donald Trump, who has 14.7 million followers on the platform. The Republican says he wants to \u201csave TikTok.\"",
      "Here are some key things to know about the case:",
      "Not now, but the short-form video-sharing app could be shut down in less than two weeks if the Supreme Court upholds the law.",
      "Congress passed the measure with bipartisan support, and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed it into law in April.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawyers challenged the law in court, joined by users and content creators who say a ban would upend their livelihoods. TikTok says the national security concerns are based on inaccurate and hypothetical information.",
      "But a unanimous appeals court panel made up of judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents has upheld the law.",
      "The justices will issue a decision after arguments Friday, a lightning-fast movement by court standards.",
      "The conservative-majority court could drop clues about how it's leaning during oral arguments.",
      "TikTok lawyers have urged the justices to step in before the law takes effect, saying even a monthlong shutdown would cause the app to lose about one-third of its daily American users and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The court could quickly block the law from going into effect before issuing a final ruling, if at least five of the nine justices think it is unconstitutional.",
      "The law is to take effect Jan. 19, the day before Trump takes over as president.",
      "He took the unusual step of filing court documents asking the Supreme Court to put the law on hold so that he could negotiate a deal for the sale of TikTok after he takes office. His position marked the latest example of him inserting himself into national issues before he takes office. It also was a change from his last presidential term, when he wanted to ban it.",
      "Parent company ByteDance has previously said it has no plans to sell. Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, last month.",
      "Free-speech advocacy groups like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have urged the court to block the law, saying the government hasn't shown credible evidence of harm and a ban would cause \u201cextraordinary disruption\u201d in Americans' lives.",
      "On the other side, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican former Senate leader, and a group of 22 states have filed briefs in support, arguing that the law protects free speech by safeguarding Americans' data and preventing the possible manipulation of information on the platform by Chinese authorities.",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",

      "An international team of scientists say they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice that's at least 1.2 million years old",
      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",
      "The European Union funded Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) with support from nations across the continent. Italy is coordinating the project.",
      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",
      "\u201cThis is truly, truly, amazingly fantastic,\u201d Alley said. \u201cThey will learn wonderful things.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Nearly a quarter of animals living in rivers, lakes and other freshwater sources are threatened with extinction, according to new research published Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHuge rivers like the Amazon can appear mighty, but at the same time freshwater environments are very fragile,\u201d said study co-author Patricia Charvet, a biologist at Brazil's Federal University of Cear\u00e1.",
      "Freshwater habitats \u2013 including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bogs and wetlands \u2013 cover less than 1% of the planet\u2019s surface, but support 10% of its animal species, said Catherine Sayer, a zoologist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in England.",
      "The researchers examined around 23,500 species of dragonflies, fish, crabs and other animals that depend exclusively on freshwater ecosystems. They found that 24% were at risk of extinction \u2013 classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered \u2013 due to compounding threats from pollution, dams, water extraction, agriculture, invasive species, climate change and other disruptions.",
      "\u201cMost species don\u2019t have just one threat putting them at risk of extinction, but many threats acting together,\u201d said Sayer, a study-co-author.",
      "The tally, published in the journal Nature, is the first that time researchers have analyzed the global risk to freshwater species. Previous studies have focused on land animals including including mammals, birds and reptiles.",
      "Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved in the study, called it \u201ca long-awaited and hugely important paper.\"",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Interior lighting aimed at reducing motion sickness. Shiny holographic dashboards displayed on windshields. And AI-powered voice assistants paired with infotainment systems to keep you company on long drives.",
      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",
      "\u201cDriver distraction is a big concern with visual displays in vehicles,\u201d said Reagan, who cautions that safety \u201cdoesn't always win out\u201d over what some companies determine is going to be \u201csexy and sell\u201d for consumers. Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",
      "Guo expressed confidence that the people in the earthquake zone would be able to rebuild under \u201cthe strong leadership\u201d of the Communist Party.",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",

Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",

      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",

      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

      "CES, the annual trade show of all-things tech, is upon us",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CES, the annual trade show of all things tech, is upon us.",
      "The multi-day event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas \u2014 where swaths of the latest gadgets and advances across industries like personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more are set to be on display. And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "summary": "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",

      "Lara emphasized during an ABC7 live interview that first and foremost you should access safety, stay away from the disaster area and don't rush into any decisions. There is a three-day cooling-off period that residents are allowed before they need to make any decision with a public adjuster.",
      "\"Often what we've seen, unfortunately, throughout multiple fires in different years throughout the state, is you start seeing out-of-state adjusters come in, trying to, you know, cut a deal with homeowners, saying you know, 'We can give you 70% of what you are entitled to when you are really entitled to 100% -- or depending on what your policy says,\" Lara explained about people being vulnerable to fraud during theses stressful and traumatic times.",
      "By pausing and waiting to sign, people can catch a potential fraud before it's too late. Lara said people can call the insurance department to check the insurance adjuster's license. He also advised people to call their insurance company before signing anything with an adjuster.",
      "\"We're just asking people to call our department, do not sign anything under duress,\" Lara said. \"This is a very traumatic moment ... and we want to let them know that please look out for fraud, do not sign anything, and we're here to be able to help them through the entire process.\"",
      "Lara emphasized people should call the California Department of Insurance. They have live operators on the phone that can help address your issues. You can contact them at 1-800-927-4357 or visit insurance.ca.gov.",
      "\"It's very important that you know you have somebody on your side,\" Lara said. \"The department is here to be your advocate during this very stressful and really traumatizing time for our community.\"",
      "When trying to figure out your insurance coverage, Lara said the most important thing you need is a copy of your home insurance policy.",
      "\"You also have to take note of your additional living expenses, limits in your policy and also track all of your additional expenses,\" he added. \"And you have to make sure you document all conversations with your insurer or an adjuster.\"",
      "As wildfires across the state became more prevalent and destructive, insurance companies have started dropping coverage for homeowners in fire-prone areas or significantly raising policy rates. Lara told ABC7 there is a law in place that doesn't allow insurance companies to drop coverage to areas within a year of a wildfire, giving business and families time to make decisions about their futures.",
      "See if you're protected or if your zip code is included in the moratorium on nonrenewals here.",
      "Another way to keep insurance companies in communities is to decrease the risk of fire damage to your home, Lara said. Homeowners can do that by making the home is up to code, the roof is updated and harden the house against flames.",

      "It's clich\u00e9 by now, but apocalyptic is what it feels like in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles. The place is simply unrecognizable. By now hundreds of homes -- including mega-mansions -- have burned. You can see the naked chimneys in the orange haze.",

    "summary": "McDonald's announced earlier this week that the company would end some initiatives centered on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's, like others, expanded DEI goals in the wake of George Floyd's death.",
      "Meta -- the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -- confirmed on Friday that it plans to end some of its DEI policies.",
      "The social media giant said it would eliminate a team devoted to DEI and cancel its equity and inclusion programs. Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams will shift to a new role, Meta said.",
      "The company will also stop an effort to work with third-party suppliers that are diverse-owned, Meta said, adding that it would roll back a \"diverse slate\" hiring program that ensured a diverse range of candidates was considered for each open role.",
      "Still, Meta emphasized the importance of making products accessible for all consumers and employing a multi-talented workforce.",
      "The move follows an announcement from McDonald's earlier this week that the company would end a few initiatives centered on diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI.",
      "While emphasizing a \"steadfast\" commitment to \"inclusion,\" the company said it would remove goals for diversity within its senior leadership ranks, and do away with a program that encourages suppliers to conduct diversity training and achieve diversity at the management level.",
      "Meta and McDonald's \u2013 like many of their peers \u2013 pledged to expand DEI commitments in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. In recent years, however, companies have faced pressure to revoke DEI policies amid an upsurge of conservative backlash and a Supreme Court decision effectively ending affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "The company announcements mark the latest in a string of corporations rolling back their DEI programs, including Walmart and John Deere, experts told ABC News. It remains unclear to what extent the moves will impact worker diversity at the firms, they added.",
      "McDonald's said it remains committed to inclusion, noting that 30% of its U.S. leaders belong to underrepresented groups. The company previously aimed to attain 35% of such leaders from underrepresented groups by the end of 2025, according to their 2023-24 Purpose & Impact Report.",
      "In a statement about the policy shift, McDonald's said it \"completed a comprehensive Civil Rights Audit (CRA) that looked at all aspects of inclusion across our system\" and also cited the \"shifting legal landscape\" following the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions, as well as \"other companies who are also re-evaluating their own programs.\"",
      "McDonald's also said it had achieved some of its diversity goals, including spending at least 25% of its budget for third-party suppliers on \"diverse-owned\" companies.",
      "\"The tides have turned,\" Traci Sitzmann, a professor of workforce development at the University of Colorado, Denver who studies corporate diversity, told ABC News. \"Many CEOs are responding to the pushback by retracting these policies.\"",
      "Some proponents of DEI sharply criticized the policy changes announced by McDonald's.",
      "\"McDonald\u2019s is joining a small but concerning list of companies that once touted the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion, but have now abandoned their values and capitulated to right-wing activists,\" Andrea Abrams, executive director of advocacy group American Pride Rises, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Still, the exact implications of the recent rollbacks remain unclear, and alarm among DEI advocates may prove overstated, Corinne Post, a professor of management at Villanova University who specializes in diversity programs, told ABC News.",
      "Corporations face competitive pressure to recruit and retain talented workers, giving them incentive to establish an environment where employees of varied identities feel welcome, Post said. She noted that some of the announced changes at McDonald's and elsewhere appear to be \"surface-level\" efforts meant to assuage critics.",
      "\"This is not a fundamental cancellation of DEI policies,\" Post said.",
      "Sitzmann, of the University of Colorado, disagreed. The policy changes at these firms suggest that corporate commitment to DEI depends on where public opinion on the issue stands at a given time, Sitzmann said, which risks compromising employee trust and hurting company performance.",
      "\"By being inauthentic in their commitment to diversity, these companies are muddying the waters and hindering their employees' ability to produce,\" Sitzmann said.",
      "Here are some of the companies that have announced rollbacks of their DEI programs:",
      "Walmart",
      "Walmart said in November that it would end some DEI efforts, including the consideration of gender and race in its evaluation of companies participating in its supply chain.",
      "The retail giant said it didn't currently have quotas and didn't plan to impose them going forward; however, it planned to stop collecting demographic data when determining financing eligibility for grants.",
      "Walmart will be \"reviewing grants to Pride events to make sure it is not financially supporting sexualized content targeting kids,\" the company said, noting that it would also exit the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index, which evaluates companies for their LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "\u201cWe've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect,\" the statement continued, \"but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone.\"",
      "The company said in a statement to ABC News, \"Our purpose, to help people save money and live better, has been at our core since our founding 62 years ago and continues to guide us today. We can deliver on it because we are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America.\"",
      "John Deere",
      "John Deere posted a list of policy changes on X in July, citing a need to prioritize efforts that \"more closely align our business strategy to meet the needs of our customers.\"",
      "The company said it would no longer participate in or support cultural awareness events, such as parades or festivals. Business Resource Groups \u2013 which connect workers who share racial, gender, sexual orientation or other identities \u2013 would focus solely on work-related topics, the company added.",
      "Still, John Deere affirmed its belief that \"a diverse workforce enables us to best meet our customers' needs and because of that we will track and advance the diversity of our organization.\"",
      "Ford",
      "In September, Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a memo to employees that the company would no longer pursue some of its DEI initiatives.",
      "The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign's annual benchmark index and make identity-based Employee Resource Groups open to all workers, Farley said in the memo, which was posted on X by conservative activist Robby Starbuck.",
      "\"Ford does not utilize hiring quotas or tie compensation to the achievement of specific diversity goals,\" Farley said.",
      "However, he added, the company remains \"deeply committed to fostering a safe and inclusive workplace and building a team that leverages diverse perspectives backgrounds and thinking styles.\"",
      "Harley-Davidson",
      "In August, Harley-Davidson said in a post on X that it had put an end to its DEI efforts months earlier. \"We have not operated a DEI function since April 2024, and we do not have a DEI function today,\" the company said.",
      "The motorcycle manufacturer would stop participating in the Human Rights Campaign and ensure that all employee training is free of \"socially motivated content,\" Harley-Davidson said.",
      "Employee Resource Groups would focus strictly on professional development and other workplace topics, the company added.",
      "\"We see it as every leader's role to ensure we have an employee base that reflects our customers and the geographies in which we operate,\" Harley-Davidson said."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 11:54:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta announced this week it was ending third-party fact-checking and moving towards community notes. Some experts fear it could lead to a rise in health misinformation.",
    "story": [
      "Meta said it's moving towards community notes to moderate content.",
      "Meta -- the company that operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp --announced on Tuesday it was ending third-party fact-checking.",
      "Some social media policy experts and public health experts are worried that the end of fact-checking could lead to the spread of medical and science misinformation and disinformation. This is especially worrisome as the U.S. is in the throes of respiratory virus season and is fighting the spread of bird flu.",
      "\"There's going to be a rise in all kinds of disinformation, misinformation, from health to hate speech and everything in between,\" Megan Squire, deputy director for data analytics and open-source intelligence at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told ABC News. \"[Health] is supposed to be a nonpartisan issue, and \u2026 we do see people trying to leverage health [misinformation], in particular, toward a political end, and that's a real shame.\"",
      "\"I'm hopeful, but I'm also concerned that this new structure that all the Meta properties are embarking on, it's just not going to end well,\" she added.",
      "The social network giant said it was following the footsteps of X, replacing the program with user-added community notes.",
      "In a press release of the announcement, Joel Kaplan, chief global affairs officer for Meta, said that the choices about what was being fact-checked showed \"biases and perspectives.\"",
      "How fact-checking, community notes work",
      "Meta started fact-checking in December 2016. Meta's fact-checking works by Meta staff identifying hoaxes or by using technology that detects posts likely to contain misinformation. The fact-checkers then conduct their own reporting to review and rate the accuracy of posts.",
      "If a piece of content is identified as false, it receives a warning label and the content's distribution is reduced so fewer people see it.",
      "Fact-checkers put in place following Donald Trump's 2016 election win were found to be \"too politically biased\" and have destroyed \"more trust than they've created,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video posted by the company.",
      "By comparison, community notes work by a user adding context to a post that may be misleading. It is then upvoted or downvoted by other users.",
      "Zeve Sanderson, executive director of NYU Center for Social Media & Policy, said after the 2016 election, there was immense pressure for social medial platforms, including Meta, to commit resources to combatting misinformation.",
      "Following the election, most posts being fact-checked were to combat political misinformation, according to Sanderson. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this was expanded to combat medical misinformation, he said.",
      "Sanderson said there were a lot of claims going unchecked online because Meta has not had enough fact-checkers to check every post. Additionally, he said some people didn't trust fact-checkers.",
      "\"There were groups of people online who didn't trust fact checkers, who saw them as biased, often in a liberal direction,\" he told ABC News. \"This crowd-sourced content moderation program \u2026 it's going to do different things well and different things poorly. We just don't know how this is actually going to work in practice.\"",
      "Meta referred ABC News back to its Tuesday announcement in response to a request for comment on plans for its community notes or potential spread of misinformation.",
      "Spread of misinformation during COVID-19",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, millions were exposed to a deluge of information including news, research, public health guidance and fact sheets, which the World Health Organization referred to as an \"infodemic.\"",
      "People were also exposed to misinformation and disinformation about what treatments work against COVID-19, how much of a risk the virus poses to children and whether COVID-19 vaccines are effective.",
      "A 2023 KFF survey found that most Americans were not sure if health information they had encountered was true or false.",
      "A report from the U.S. Surgeon General in 2021 found that misinformation led to people rejecting masking and social distancing, using unproven treatment and rejecting COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Experts told ABC News that members of the general public often do not have enough health literacy to determine if they should trust or not trust information they encounter online or on social media.",
      "Squire said sometimes government agencies do not put out information in an \"interesting\" format, which may lead people to click on \"entertaining\" content from misinformation and disinformation peddlers.",
      "\"Some of these YouTube videos about health misinformation are a lot more entertaining. Their message just travels faster,\" she said. \"When you're presenting scientific information -- I know this firsthand as a former college professor -- that's a struggle. You have to be pretty talented at it and, a lot of times, where the expertise lies is not necessarily where the most expedient, fun videos are and stuff.\"",
      "How to combat health misinformation",
      "Meta's change comes as the U.S. faces an increase in bird flu cases and continues treating patients falling ill with respiratory illnesses.",
      "As of Jan. 8, there have been 66 human cases of bird flu reported in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "It's also flu season. As of the week ending Dec. 28, 2024, there have been at least 5.3 million illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations and 2,700 deaths from flu so far this season, according to CDC estimates.",
      "Meanwhile, health care professionals have been encouraging Americans to get their flu shot and other vaccines -- including COVID and RSV -- to protect themselves against serious disease.",
      "Experts are worried that with the change from fact-checking to community notes that misinformation could spread about the effectiveness of vaccines or how serious an illness is.",
      "\"I am concerned about the sheer amount of inaccurate information that's out there,\" Dr. Brian Southwell, a distinguished Fellow at nonprofit research institute RTI International and an adjunct faculty member at Duke University, told ABC News. \"That's something that you know ought to bother all of us as we're trying to make good decisions. But there's a lot that could be done, even beyond, you know, the realm of social media to try to improve the information environments that are available for people.\"",
      "Southwell said one thing that public health experts and federal health agencies can do is to get an idea of the questions that users are going to have about medical topics -- such as bird flu and seasonal flu -- and be ready with information to answer those questions online.",
      "To combat being exposed to information, the experts recommended paying attention to where the information is coming from, whether it's a respected source or someone you are unfamiliar with.",
      "\"There are various skills that are important, things like lateral reading, where rather than just evaluating the claim, you do research about the source of that claim and what you can find out about them to understand what some of their incentives or track record might be,\" Sanderson said.",
      "\"This is obviously something that, sadly, social media platforms are not designed in order to incentivize this sort of behavior, so the responsibility is thrust on users to sort of look out for themselves,\" he added.",

      "Waukesha County Circuit Judge Michael Bohren ordered the state's Department of Health Services to come up with a plan for her supervised released within 60 days. Geyser will be returned to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute until the plan is finalized, after which she is expected to reside in a group home.",
      "Geyser -- now 22 -- was 12 when she and a classmate lured their friend into the woods in Waukesha, Wisconsin, and stabbed her 19 times to please the online fictional character Slender Man, according to authorities, in a case that continues to generate national headlines.",
      "The victim, Payton Leutner, suffered life-threatening injuries but ultimately survived. Geyser and her co-assailant, Anissa Weier, were charged in adult court with first-degree attempted intentional homicide.",
      "Geyser was convicted of the charges but found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, and was sentenced to up to 40 years in a psychiatric institution.",
      "Weier was found not guilty by mental disease or defect after pleading guilty to a lesser charge, and was sentenced to up to 25 years in a psychiatric institution. In 2021, at the age of 19, Weier was granted supervised release.",
      "Weier and her family declined to comment Thursday on Geyser's release.",
      "Testifying in a Waukesha courtroom on Thursday, three psychologists who've worked closely with Geyser testified to her preparedness for supervised release.",
      "\"At this point I am in favor, or in support, of her petition for release. Specifically, I don't think she currently poses a significant risk of substantial harm to herself, others or to property damage,\" psychologist Brooke Lundbohm testified to the judge over Zoom.",
      "Lundbohm, who testified under subpoena, said Geyser's mental health had improved significantly since a 2021 suicide attempt. She can be \"incredibly self-critical\" and have \"low self-esteem,\" but is \"well-spoken\" and \"incredibly bright,\" Lundbohm said.",
      "Stacie Leutner, the mother of Payton Leutner, said in a statement to ABC News ahead of Thursday's hearing: \"Morgan Geyser has withdrawn her request to be released twice. More recently, her request was denied. We are confident that the judicial system will make a decision that will ensure the community, and my daughter remain safe.\"",
      "Geyser was most recently denied release in April 2024.",
      "Kenneth Robbins, another psychologist called as a witness, said Geyser \"has a lot of potential\" to reintegrate back into society. She has discussed goals for the future, expressing interest in becoming a librarian, and eventually a therapist for people with substance abuse disorders, he said.",
      "Geyser was diagnosed with schizophrenia after the stabbing, but over the last two years has not exhibited psychotic symptoms and has been successfully weaned off of antipsychotic medication, Robbins said. She continues to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and autism, he said, but has not shown evidence of suicidal ideation since her 2021 attempt.",
      "Psychologist Deborah Collins testified Geyser does not have \"unrealistic goals\" about what her life would look like if released, saying she understands she would need to live in a group home and \"would take whatever she could get in terms of employment.\"",
      "As a condition of her supervised release, Geyser understands she would need to wear an ankle monitor, Collins said.",
      "\"She wants to begin, I guess, her life outside of the institution, and recognized that she would be subject to a whole host of expectations and rules, and what could happen if she violated those,\" Collins said.",

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "Delta Air Lines fourth-quarter results topped analysts\u2019 expectations as travel demand was strong during the crucial holiday period",
      "Delta Air Lines topped profit and revenue expectations in the fourth quarter on strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Delta said Friday that travel demand picked up throughout the quarter. During November and December, the airline said that it saw four of the top 10 revenue days in its history and double-digit growth in cash bookings driven by both leisure and corporate travelers.",
      "\u201cAs we move into 2025, we expect strong demand for travel to continue, with consumers increasingly seeking the premium products and experiences that Delta provides,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in a prepared statement on Friday.",
      "The company earned $843 million, or $1.29 per share. Per share earnings removing one-time expenses were $1.85, easily beating Wall Street projections of $1.76, according to industry analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.",
      "A year earlier, Delta earned $2.04 billion, or $3.16 per share.",
      "Delta hit the top end of its own forecast for the three months ended Dec. 3, having said that it would earn between $1.60 and $1.85 per share.",
      "Revenue rose to $15.56 billion, from $14.22 billion, last year, also topping Wall Street estimates of $14.99 billion.",
      "Total revenue per available seat mile climbed to $21.60 from $20.78 a year ago.",
      "Delta also benefited from a drop in fuel costs during the quarter. Fuel expense fell to $2.41 billion from $2.94 billion. The average fuel price per gallon declined to $2.36 from $3.01.",
      "Shares of Delta jumped more than 6% before the opening bell on Friday after saying that it now anticipates full-year earnings will be more than $7.35 per share, and between 70 cents and $1 in the first quarter.",
      "Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting full-year earnings of $6.11 per share and first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share.",
      "Delta's strong quarter also pushed the shares of other airlines higher in premarket trading, with American Airlines up more than 4%, JetBlue rising about 2% and United Airlines climbing more than 5%.",
      "Among U.S. carriers, Delta scored the highest for on-time arrivals last year, aviation-data provider Cirium reported last week. That was despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "A federal judge is set to hear arguments on whether to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for continuing to spread lies about two Georgia election workers after they secured a $148 million defamation judgment against him",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge is set to hear arguments Friday on whether to hold Rudy Giuliani in contempt of court for continuing to spread lies about two Georgia election workers after they secured a $148 million defamation judgment against him.",
      "Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have asked U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., to impose civil contempt sanctions against Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who served as Donald Trump's attorney. They say Giuliani has continued to falsely accuse Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, of committing election fraud in connection with the 2020 election.",
      "Moss and Freeman sued Giuliani, saying he upended their lives with racist threats and harassment. A jury sided with the mother and daughter, who are Black, in December 2023 and awarded them $75 million in punitive damages plus roughly $73 million in other damages.",
      "\"Mr. Giuliani started lying about Plaintiffs in December of 2020, and refused to stop after repeatedly being told that his election-rigging conspiracy theory about Plaintiffs was baseless, malicious, and dangerous,\" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote.",
      "Giuliani's attorneys argued that the plaintiffs haven't presented \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that he violated a court order in the defamation case in comments that he made on November podcasts about alleged ballot counting irregularities in Georgia.",
      "\u201cGiuliani acted with the good faith belief that his comments did not violate the (judgment) and he should not be subject to contempt sanctions,\u201d his lawyers wrote.",
      "If Howell holds Giuliani, a Republican, in contempt of court, she would be the second federal judge to do so this week. On Monday in New York, Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt of court for related claims that he failed to turn over evidence to help the judge decide whether he can keep a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium.",
      "Giuliani, who testified in Liman\u2019s Manhattan courtroom Jan. 3, said he didn't turn over everything because he believed the requests were overly broad, inappropriate or even a \u201ctrap\u201d set by plaintiffs' lawyers.",
      "Giuliani, 80, said in a court filing that he will attend Friday's hearing before Howell despite having travel-related concerns about his health and safety. He said he gets death threats and has been told to be careful about traveling.",
      "\"I had hoped the Court would understand and accommodate my needs. However, it appears I was mistaken,\" he said in the filing.",
      "On the witness stand, Moss and Freeman described fearing for their lives after becoming the target of a false conspiracy theory that Giuliani and other Republicans spread as they tried to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Moss told jurors she tried to change her appearance, seldom leaves her home and suffers from panic attacks.",
      "\u201cMoney will never solve all my problems,\u201d Freeman told reporters after the jury's verdict. \u201cI can never move back into the house that I call home. I will always have to be careful about where I go and who I choose to share my name with. I miss my home. I miss my neighbors, and I miss my name.\u201d",

      "Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area.",
      "In hilly, upscale Pacific Palisades, home to Hollywood stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Billy Crystal who lost houses in the fire, officials have placed the origin of the wind-whipped blaze behind a home on Piedra Morada Drive, which sits above a densely wooded arroyo.",
      "While lightning is the most common source of fires in the U.S., according to the National Fire Protection Association, investigators were able to rule that out quickly. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton fire, which started in east Los Angeles County and has also destroyed hundreds of homes.",
      "The next two most common causes: fires intentionally set, and those sparked by utility lines.",
      "John Lentini, owner of Scientific Fire Analysis in Florida, who has investigated large fires in California including the Oakland Hills fire in 1991, said the size and scope of the blaze doesn\u2019t change the approach to finding out what caused it.",
      "\u201cThis was once a small fire,\u201d Lentini said. \u201cPeople will focus on where the fire started, determine the origin and look around the origin and determine the cause.\u201d",
      "So far there has been no official indication of arson in either blaze, and utility lines have not yet been identified as a cause either.",
      "Utilities are required to report to the California Public Utilities Commission when they know of \u201celectric incidents potentially associated with a wildfire,\u201d Terrie Prosper, the commission's communications director, said via email. CPUC staff then investigate to see if there were violations of state law.",
      "The 2017 Thomas Fire, one of the largest fires in state history, was sparked by Southern California Edison power lines that came into contact during high wind, investigators determined. The blaze killed two people and charred more than 440 square miles (1,140 square kilometers), according to the investigation headed by the Ventura County Fire Department.",
      "So far no such reports for the current fires have been posted to the CPUC website that tracks such filings.",
      "While lightning, arson and utility lines are the most common causes, debris burning and fireworks are also common causes.",
      "But fires are incited by myriad sources, including accidents.",
      "In 2021, a couple's gender reveal stunt started a large fire that torched close to 36 square miles (about 90 square kilometers) of terrain, destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings and claimed the life of a firefighter, Charlie Morton.",
      "The Eaton and Palisades fires were still burning with little to no containment on Thursday. Winds softened, but there was no rain in the forecast as the flames moved through miles of dry landscape.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to go out when it runs out of fuel, or when the weather stops,\u201d Lentini said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to put that thing out until it\u2019s ready to go out.\u201d"

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump hosted 22 of the nation's 27 Republican governors for dinner at his Florida club on Thursday night, looking to help drive the agenda in conservative-run states after he takes office in 11 days.",
      "Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte told reporters outside the gathering that some of the GOP governors unable to attend were being inaugurated, and that one was delayed by snow and was unable to make it to Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. But he said attendees who could come were \u201cthrilled to accept the president-elect\u2019s invitation\u201d and welcomed a coming \u201ccollaborative, working relationship, which we have not had for four years\u201d during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cIt's been a long period without cooperation from Washington,\" Gianforte told reporters outside. \"So, we're looking forward to the new administration coming in. We have a lot of business to get done on behalf of our states. We're just pleased to be here to meet with the president.\u201d",
      "Most reporters weren't invited to the proceedings, but cameras were allowed inside for part of the time. That allowed Trump to answer a series of questions from a Fox News Channel journalist.",
      "He discussed everything from his desire to have the U.S. take control of Greenland to the parade of technology company leaders who have come to Florida to visit him since Election Day, to his threats to impose steep tariffs on Canada.",
      "The president-elect also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cwants to meet, and we're setting it up.\u201d",
      "The dinner came after Trump held a lengthy, closed-door meeting Wednesday with Republican Senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Trump described his discussions with his senators, as \u201ca love fest\u201d but added, \u201cThis is a love fest, too.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe governors aren\u2019t exactly chopped liver,\u201d he said to laughter.",
      "Trump also renewed previous vows to cooperate with leaders in blue states, too, saying, \"We want to get along with the Democrats. I\u2019m trying to be nice.\u201d",
      "Gianforte said that many of the governors present were concerned about \u201coverreach\u201d by the Environmental Protection Agency and other federal entities under President Joe Biden, adding, \u201cI know each governor that's standing up here has expressed frustration.\u201d",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 Trump\u2019s GOP presidential primary rival in last year\u2019s primary \u2014 was asked about the president-elect sharply criticizing Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom as cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles.",
      "DeSantis blamed the media for what he said was unnecessarily promoting controversy and political division, adding that Trump will collaborate effectively with states regardless of whether they are red or blue.",
      "\u201cI worked well with Biden, during his time, with natural disasters, and I worked well with Donald Trump,\u201d DeSantis said, referring to hurricanes that have hit Florida as well as the deadly collapse of a beachfront condo in Surfside in 2021. \u201cSo, I\u2019m very confident, as a state that knows \u2014 we face these \u2014 that a Trump administration is going to be very strong and going to be there for the people regardless of party.\u201d",
      "One of the questions Trump answered Thursday was about the frequent drone sightings that made headlines in recent weeks, but have seen attention wane more recently. That prompted several of the governors around the table to express concern that such aircraft could make incursions into military or other secure areas.",
      "\u201cThey don't want to talk about it,\u201d Trump said, repeating an assertion he's made in the past that the government may be covering something up on the issue. He promised to shed more light on it after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.",
      "\u201cWe're gonna find out on the 21st,\u201d he said. \"You have to give me a little time after the Inauguration. But, shortly thereafter, I will give you a report on it. We'll tell you exactly what it is.\u201d",

He also raised questions about who at the university rushed to issue a check to Shepard, noting that some regents already had resigned amid pressure from the governor.",
      "The attorney general's office initially filed an emergency motion in state district court seeking to delay any payouts to Shepard, not knowing that a check already had been issued on Jan. 2.",
      "The state is now seeking to prohibit Shepherd from spending the money and asking the court to establish a trust where it could be deposited until the legal dispute is resolved.",
      "Despite requests for documentation from the university, Torrez said his office has not received any records that would show who initiated the negotiations around Shepard's departure. He suggested the process has been tainted by greed and arrogance and that students will pay the price.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely disgraceful that the people who have been entrusted with making sure that they get the education they need to build a better future have instead used that opportunity to enrich themselves, to go on lavish taxpayer funded trips, and then when they are held to account, to hand out a golden parachute to one of their pals,\" Torrez said. That will not stand.\u201d",
      "Shepard's legal team disputed the attorney general's claims, saying regents are responsible for negotiating and approving executive compensation and severance agreements and that notices appeared in the local newspaper that the board would be discussing the president's contract during a Dec. 20 meeting.",
      "John Anderson, an attorney for Shepard, said in a statement to The Associated Press that the board had appointed a subcommittee to negotiate the separation agreement before unanimously approving it.",
      "\u201cThis entire process was handled appropriately, legally and transparently,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cDr. Shepard did not expedite his payment. Any allegations to the contrary have no legal or factual basis.\u201d",
      "According to court documents, the university agreed to pay Shepard more than three times the amount required if it had terminated his employment without cause. The agreement also guarantees Shepard a spot as a tenured faculty member, earning at least $200,000 annually for five years. He can serve remotely and was given an eight-month sabbatical with full pay.",
      "The leadership shakeup follows an investigation by the state auditor's office that found more than $363,000 in wasteful spending and improper use of public funds.",
      "State lawmakers started raising questions in 2023 about Shepard's spending on international trips and on high-end furniture and about his wife, Valerie Plame\u2019s, use of a university purchasing card. At the time, Shepard said regents vetted his spending requests and that he was familiar with policies governing the use of public money.",
      "The events could prompt lawmakers to consider new legislation during the session that begins this month.",
      "House Speaker Javier Martinez on Thursday said he would support changes to ensure public institutions are managed in the best interests of students and taxpayers, rather than for personal enrichment of university officials.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this is about safeguarding the money of the people of the state of New Mexico, and this is about ensuring that no one is above the law,\u201d he said."

      "___",
      "Leaders of the clergy, distinguished guests and most importantly the Carter family.",
      "In April 2021, Jill and I visited Jimmy and Rosalynn on a warm spring day down in Plains, Georgia. We wanted to see them.",
      "Rosalynn met us at the front door with her signature smile. Together, we entered a home that they had shared for almost 77 years of marriage, an unassuming red brick ranch home. They flexed their modesty more than any trappings of power.",
      "We walked into the living room where Jimmy greeted us like family. That day, just the four of us sat in the living room and shared memories that spanned almost six decades, a deep friendship that started in 1974.",
      "I was a 31-year-old senator. And I was the first senator outside of Georgia, maybe the first senator, to endorse his candidacy for president.",
      "It was an endorsement based on what I believe is Jimmy Carter\u2019s enduring attribute: Character. Character. Character.",
      "Because of that, character, I believe, is destiny. Destiny in our lives and quite frankly, destiny in the life of the nation.",
      "It is an accumulation of a million things built on character that leads to a good life in a decent country. A life of purpose, a life of meaning. Now, how do we find that good life? What does it look like? What does it take to build character? Do the ends justify the means?",
      "Jimmy Carter\u2019s friendship taught me, and through his life taught me, that strength of character is more than title or the power we hold. It\u2019s the strength to understand that everyone should be treated with dignity, respect. That everyone, and I mean everyone, deserves an even shot. Not a guarantee, but just a shot.",
      "You know, we have an obligation to give hate no safe harbor. And to stand up to what my dad used to say is the greatest sin of all: the abuse of power.",
      "Now, it\u2019s not about being perfect, because none of us are perfect. We\u2019re all fallible. But it\u2019s about asking ourselves: Are we striving to do things, the right things? What values? What are the values that animate our spirit? To operate from fear or hope, ego or generosity? Do we show grace? Do we keep the faith when it\u2019s most tested?",
      "For keeping the faith with the best of humankind and the best of America is the story, in my view, from my perspective, of Jimmy Carter\u2019s life.",
      "The story of a man, to state the obvious \u2013 you\u2019ve heard today some great, great eulogies -- who came from a house without running water or electricity and rose to the pinnacle of power.",
      "The story of a man who was at once driven and devoted to making real the words of his savior and the ideals of this nation. The story of a man who never let the tides of politics divert him from his mission to serve and shape the world.",
      "The man had character.",
      "Jimmy held a deep Christian faith in God. And that his candidacy spoke and wrote about faith as a substance of things hoped for, and evidence of the things not seen. Faith founded on commandments of scripture. Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul. And love thy neighbor as thyself.",
      "Easy to say, but very, very difficult to do. In his life, in this life, any walk of faith can be difficult. It can be lonely. But it requires action to be the doers of the world.",
      "But in that commandment lies the essence, in my view, found in the gospel, found in many faith traditions, and found in the very idea of America. Because the very journey of our nation is a walk of sheer faith. To do the work, to be the country we say we are, to be the country we say we want to be. A nation where all are created equal in the image of God and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.",
      "We\u2019ve never fully lived up to that idea of America. We\u2019ve never walked away from it either, because of patriots like Jimmy Carter. Throughout his life, he showed us what it means to be a practitioner of good works and a good and faithful servant of God and of the people.",
      "And today, many think he was from a bygone era. But in reality, he saw well into the future.",
      "A white Southern Baptist who led on civil rights. A decorated Navy veteran who brokered peace. A brilliant nuclear engineer who led on nuclear nonproliferation. A hard-working farmer who championed conservation and clean energy.",
      "And a president who redefined the relationship with a vice president.",
      "Jimmy and I often talked about our dear friend Walter Mondale, whom we all miss very much. Together they formed a model partnership of collaboration and trust, because both were men of character.",
      "And as we all know, Jimmy Carter also established a model post-presidency by making a powerful difference as a private citizen in America. And I might add, as you all know around the world, through it all he showed us how character and faith start with ourselves and then flow to others.",
      "At our best, we share the better parts of ourselves: joy, solidarity, love, commitment. Not for reward, but in reverence for the incredible gift of life we\u2019ve all been granted. To make every minute of our time here on Earth count.",
      "That\u2019s the definition of a good life, a life Jimmy Carter lived during his 100 years.",
      "To young people, to anyone in search of meaning and purpose, study the power of Jimmy Carter\u2019s example.",
      "I miss him, but I take solace in knowing that he and his beloved Rosalynn are reunited again. To the entire Carter family, thank you, and I mean this sincerely, for sharing them both with America and the world. We love you all.",
      "Jill and I will cherish our visits with them, including that last one in their home. We saw Jimmy as he always was, at peace with a life fully lived. A good life of purpose and meaning, of character driven by destiny and filled with the power of faith, hope and love.",
      "Say it again: Faith, hope and love.",
      "As he returns to Plains, Georgia, for his final resting place, we can say goodbye. In the words of the prophet Micah, who Jimmy so admired until his final breath, Jimmy Carter did justly, loved mercy, walked humbly.",
      "May God bless a great American, a dear friend and a good man. May he rise up, be raised up on eagle\u2019s wings, bear you on the breath of dawn, and make you to shine like the sun, and hold you in the palm of His hand.",
      "God bless you, Jimmy Carter."

      "As the cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles, President-elect Donald Trump isn't offering much sympathy",
      "WASHINGTON -- As cataclysmic wildfires rage across Los Angeles, President-elect Donald Trump hasn't been offering much sympathy. Instead, he's claiming he could do a better job managing the crisis, spewing falsehoods and casting blame on the state's Democratic governor.",
      "Trump has lashed out at his longtime political foe Gov. Gavin Newsom's forest management policies and falsely claimed the state's fish conservation efforts are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. Referring to the governor by a derisive nickname, Trump said he should resign.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 180,000 people have been under evacuation orders and the fires have consumed more than 45 square miles (116 square kilometers). One that destroyed the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades became the most destructive blaze in Los Angeles history.",
      "Trump v. Newsom: Round 2 was to be expected \u2014 the liberal Democrat has long been one of Trump\u2019s biggest foils. But the Western fires are also a sign of something far more grave than a political spat or a fight over fish. Wildfire season is growing ever longer thanks to increasing drought and heat brought on by climate change.",
      "Trump refuses to recognize the environmental dangers, instead blaming increasing natural disasters on his political opponents or on acts of God. He has promised to drill for more oil and cut back on renewable energy.",
      "On Thursday, Trump said on social media that Newsom should \u201copen up the water main\u201d \u2014 an overly simplistic solution to a complex problem. \u201cNO MORE EXCUSES FROM THIS INCOMPETENT GOVERNOR,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cIT\u2019S ALREADY FAR TOO LATE!\u201d",
      "Standing on the street in a scorched subdivision as a home behind him was engulfed in flames, Newsom responded to the criticism when asked about it by CNN.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally fleeing. People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools. Families completely torn asunder. Churches burned down, and this guy wants to politicize it,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI have a lot of thoughts and I know what I want to say, but I won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "In a post on his Truth Social media network, Trump tried to connect dry hydrants to criticism of the state\u2019s approach to balancing the distribution of water to farms and cities with the need to protect endangered species including the Delta smelt. Trump has sided with farmers over environmentalists in a long-running dispute over California\u2019s scarce water resources. But that debate has nothing to do with the hydrant issue in Los Angeles, driven by an intense demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes.",
      "About 40% of Los Angeles city water comes from state-controlled projects connected to northern California and the state has limited the water it delivers this year. But the southern California reservoirs these canals help feed are at above-average levels for this time of year.",
      "Roughly 20% of hydrants across the city went dry as crews battled blazes, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. Firefighters in Southern California are accustomed to dealing with the strong Santa Ana winds that blow in the fall and winter, but the hurricane-force gusts earlier in the week took them by surprise. The winds grounded firefighting aircraft that should have been making critical water drops, straining the hydrant system.",
      "\u201cThis is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my 25 years on the fire department,\u201d Los Angeles Fire Capt. Adam VanGerpen told CBS This Morning.",
      "Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said the ferocity of the fire made the demand for water four times greater than \u201cwe\u2019ve ever seen in the system.\u201d",
      "Hydrants are designed for fighting fires at one or two houses at a time, not hundreds, Qui\u00f1ones said, and refilling the tanks also requires asking fire departments to pause firefighting efforts.",
      "President Joe Biden, who was in California for an environmental event that ended up being canceled as the fires raged, appeared with Newsom at a Santa Monica firehouse on Wednesday and quickly issued a major disaster declaration for California, releasing some immediate federal funds.",
      "But any additional federal response will be overseen by Trump, who has a history of withholding or delaying federal aid to punish his political enemies.",
      "In September, during a press conference at his Los Angeles golf course, Trump threatened: \"We won\u2019t give him money to put out all his fires. And if we don\u2019t give him the money to put out his fires, he\u2019s got problems.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s support in California has increased in recent years, which could further embolden him in his tussles with Democratic leaders there. In 2024, he improved on his vote share in Los Angeles and surrounding areas hit by the fires by 4.68 percentage points. And while he still lost the state overall, he grew his overall margin by 4 points compared to the 2020 election.",
      "As for the impact of the fires on Californians, Trump said areas in Beverly Hills and around it were \u201cbeing decimated\u201d and that he had \"many friends living in those houses.\u201d He framed the losses as a potential hit to the state's finances.",
      "\u201cThe biggest homes, some of the most valuable homes in the world are just destroyed. I don\u2019t even know. You talk about a tax base, if those people leave you\u2019re going to lose half your tax base of California,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Michael Rivas, 19, of Miami, was one of six men arrested after a series of events in Danbury on Aug. 25. He pleaded guilty to kidnapping and conspiracy charges in federal court in Hartford. Two others are expected to enter similar pleas in the same court on Friday.",
      "The couple were driving in a new Lamborghini SUV when the suspects forced them out of the SUV, assaulted them, put them in a van and bound them, police said. Witnesses immediately alerted police. Four of the men were arrested after abandoning their vehicles including the van and fleeing on foot, while the other two were later taken into custody at a nearby home the group had rented through Airbnb, authorities said. The couple were injured but survived the ordeal.",
      "Rivas, dressed in a tan prison uniform with his legs shackled during the hearing, apologized for his actions. He said it was a \u201cdumb\u201d decision to help one of his co-defendants carry out what he called a \u201cvendetta.\u201d He did not elaborate.",
      "His lawyer, Brian Woolf, said Rivas accepted a co-defendant\u2019s invitation to take part in the plot with the hope of getting a share of the ransom money, and he regrets that decision.",
      "The plot was hatched because the suspects \u201cbelieved the victims\u2019 son had access to significant amounts of digital currency,\u201d and they planned to demand a ransom from the son to be paid in digital currency,\u201d according to a federal indictment.",
      "Just a week earlier, at least two thieves had stolen $240 million worth of Bitcoin in an elaborate scam over the internet and by phone, and then went on an indulgent spending spree on cars, mansions, travel, jewelry and nights out at clubs, authorities said.",

      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Ross Weingarten declined to comment after Thursday's court hearing.",
      "In mid-September, federal prosecutors announced that the two men, Malone Lam, 20, and Jeandiel Serrano, 21, had been indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in connection with the cryptocurrency theft.",
      "Court documents say unnamed coconspirators were in on the scam with the two men. Their lawyers have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "Prosecutors said in court documents that Lam, Serrano and the unnamed coconspirators posed as technical support staff for Google and a cryptocurrency exchange while contacting the victim of the theft with an offer to help him with a supposed security breach.",
      "The victim, from Washington, D.C., believed them and gave them remote access to his computer on Aug. 18. That resulted in the alleged thieves making off with more than 4,100 Bitcoin, then valued at more than $240 million, prosecutors said. That amount of Bitcoin is now worth nearly $380 million.",
      "According to prosecutors, Serrano, of Los Angeles, admitted during an interview with federal investigators that he used the stolen currency to buy three automobiles, worth more than $1 million in total, as well as a $500,000 watch. He also said he had about $20 million of the victim\u2019s currency and agreed to transfer the funds to the FBI, authorities said.",
      "Meanwhile Lam, a citizen of Singapore who had addresses in Los Angeles and Miami, Florida, was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a night at Los Angeles night clubs and acquiring custom Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Porsches, prosecutors said. He also was renting two Miami mansions, bought a $2 million watch and had a Lamborghini Revuelto worth more than $1 million.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in court documents that at least $100 million of the stolen funds remained missing.",
      "Exactly a week after the crypto theft, the couple from Danbury, a city of more than 80,000 people along the New York border, were forced out of their SUV in their hometown after one of the carjackers\u2019 vehicles rear-ended them and two other vehicles surrounded them. The group assaulted the man with a baseball bat and dragged the woman by her hair as they put them in the van, where the couple were bound with duct tape, police said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply remorseful for my irresponsible behavior,\u201d Rivas told U.S. District Judge Sarala Nagala on Thursday. \u201cI should have known better.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not what my parents taught me growing up,\u201d he added.",
      "Rivas and the other five men also are facing kidnapping and assault charges in Connecticut state court. The other men are also from Florida.",
      "Sentencing was set for May 13. The prosecution and defense agreed on sentencing guidelines that call for about 11 to 14 years in prison."

      "Six people who were injured and the father of a man who was killed in the New Year's truck attack filed a lawsuit Thursday against the City of New Orleans and two contractors, claiming they failed to protect revelers from an Army veteran who sped around a police blockade and raced down Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring at least 30.",
      "The attack by Shamsud-Din Jabbar was tragic but preventable, leaving the six victims with broken bones, physical suffering and mental anguish and killing Brandon Taylor, according to the lawsuit filed in Orleans Parish Civil District Court by Matthew Hemmer with the Morris Bart Law Firm. Jabbar was killed in a shootout with police.",
      "The plaintiffs, who are seeking unspecified damages, include Alexis Windham, who suffered impact and gunshot injuries to her foot, and Corian Evans, Jalen Lilly, Justin Brown, Shara Frison and Gregory Townsend, who suffered broken bones and other injuries. They were joined by Brandon Taylor's father, Joseph. Windham, Evans, Lilly and Brown are from Alabama while Frison and Townsend are from Missouri.",

      "Email and phone messages left with the City of New Orleans, Mayor LaToya Cantrell, and contractors Mott MacDonald and Hard Rock Construction seeking comment on the lawsuit were not immediately returned.",
      "Incidents of vehicles driving into crowds started increasing after 2016, when 86 people were killed on Bastille Day in Nice, France, the lawsuit said. New Orleans sought advice on the risk of this type of attack in the French Quarter and invested $40 million in public safety improvement projects, including acquiring portable bollards \u2014 protective columns designed to block vehicle traffic \u2014to keep cars off Bourbon Street.",
      "However, the bollards were often disabled when the tracks they move on got clogged with beads, drink containers, rainwater and other fluids, the lawsuit said. A 2019 report by New York firm Interfor International said the French Quarter was at risk for a vehicular attack, adding \u201cthe current bollard system on Bourbon Street does not appear to work\" and should be fixed immediately.",
      "An April 2024 report by Mott MacDonald, a design firm hired for roadway projects, included the possibility of a Ford F-150 truck turning on to Bourbon Street, which is what happened on New Year's Day, but the company's bollard replacement project did not include fixed bollards in the French Quarter, the lawsuit said.",
      "Construction on the safety updates began in November, but work on Canal Street didn't begin until Dec. 19 and construction was ongoing on Jan. 1, when the attack occurred, the suit said. Authorities have said Jabbar drove an F-150 pickup truck onto a sidewalk around a police car blockading the Canal Street entrance to Bourbon Street.",
      "\u201cAppropriate barriers, temporary or otherwise, were not erected in the construction site,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cAs a result, the intersection had the appearance of a soft target. Upon initial penetration, Mr. Jabbar was able to travel approximately three blocks down Bourbon Street.\u201d",
      "The contractors and the city failed to implement an effective system for deterring such a threat, the suit said.",

    "summary": "Tennessee's Department of Correction has released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual after initially refusing to do so",
    "story": [
      "Tennessee's Department of Correction has released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual after initially refusing to do so",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee on Thursday released a redacted version of its newly completed execution manual, blacking out sporadic titles and team names throughout the notably trimmed-down document that now provides vague guidelines and omits previously detailed steps on carrying out the death penalty.",
      "The Tennessee Department of Correction initially refused to hand over the manual when pressed by The Associated Press, arguing that the state had to keep the entire manual secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved.",
      "However, on Thursday, the agency abruptly reversed course and provided the AP with a copy of the lethal injection protocol. Their only explanation for the change was that the state was revising its decision.",
      "The 44-page manual is noticeably shorter than the 2018 version the state had been operating under, which contained nearly 100 pages, including 11 pages detailing how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. The state's failure to follow those procedures forced Republican Gov. Bill Lee in 2022 to call a last-minute halt to the execution of inmate Oscar Smith and then place a moratorium on new executions while the process was under review.",
      "An independent report later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested as required by the manual. Later, the state Attorney General\u2019s Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee\u2019s lethal injection drugs \u201cincorrectly testified\u201d under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required.",
      "The new manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes a requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Yet the new protocol does include several new additions, including now authorizing the state to deviate from the protocol whenever the Correction Department commissioner deems it necessary.",
      "In Tennessee, the 2018 lethal injection protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence. The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. One other change \u2014 the people most responsible for carrying out the execution will now be outside contractors. The manual requires an IV team of at least two people and a physician who are not Tennessee Department of Correction personnel.",
      "When ordering the pause in 2022, Lee stressed that it was his administration's duty to \u201censure continued transparency\u201d for Tennesseans surrounding the death penalty and that he expected \"the Tennessee Department of Correction to leave no question that procedures are correctly followed.\u201d",
      "Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender\u2019s habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee\u2019s death row inmates, told the AP in an email that the new manual \u201cfails to address the many concerns raised by the independent investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs of today, we still do not know the source of drugs, whether they are compounded, or whether they have been diverted from the market into a gray market, how they will be procured, stored, tested, and administered,\" she said. \"This level of secrecy is inconsistent with the promises of transparency made by the Governor two years ago.\u201d",
      "Across the U.S., executions have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections.",
      "Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams. Meanwhile, some courts have dismissed states' claim that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials over a lack of evidence."

      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she will push for new laws to make it harder for hedge funds to purchase large numbers of single-family homes in the state",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Thursday said she will push for new laws to make it harder for hedge funds to purchase large numbers of single-family homes in the state.",
      "In a statement, Hochul said she would propose legislation this year that would require a 75 day waiting period before large investment firms could place bids on new homes hitting the market and limit certain tax benefits when the firms purchase homes.",
      "The plan comes as lawmakers elsewhere have also sought to address public concerns that hedge funds or other big investors are buying up single-family homes and shrinking the housing supply for individual buyers and families. Experts have blamed housing scarcity on several factors, including high mortgage rates and years of underbuilding of new homes.",
      "Hochul, in her statement, said \u201cshadowy private equity giants are buying up the housing supply in communities across New York, leaving everyday homebuyers with fewer and fewer affordable options.\u201d",
      "Private equity firms own more than 500,000 homes nationwide, according to the governor's news release, with some estimates expecting the firms to own up to 40% of the single-family rental market by 2030. There were more than 145 million housing units in the country in 2023, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "A report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies found that non-individual investors \u2014 which includes landlords who form limited liability corporations \u2014 owned a quarter of single-family rentals in 2021. Larger investors tended to buy newer and bigger homes in places with population growth and rapid rent increases, according to the report.",
      "A different report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that the country's five largest institutional investors owned nearly 2% of all single-family rental homes nationally in 2022, which amounted to about 300,000 homes.",
      "Hochul, a Democrat, has rolled out a series of economic proposals for the state's legislative session that are geared toward addressing the state's high cost of living. On Thursday, she also announced proposals to incentivize the construction of starter homes and help first-time homeowners with down payments.",

      "Five current and former U.S. presidents have come together for Jimmy Carter\u2019s funeral",
      "WASHINGTON -- As they filed into the front pews at Washington National Cathedral, wearing dark suits and mostly solemn faces, five current and former presidents came together for Jimmy Carter's funeral. For a service that stretched more than an hour, the feuding, grievances and enmity that had marked their rival campaigns and divergent politics gave way to a reverential moment for one of their own.",
      "Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the first two of the group to take their seats Thursday, shook hands and chatted at length. Trump, the former president who will retake the Oval Office in 11 days, leaned in and listened intently to his predecessor, notwithstanding the political chasm between them. At times, the two flashed smiles.",
      "Obama, who attended without his wife, Michelle, shared a second-row pew with former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived last and sat in the pew just in front of them.",
      "Members of the exclusive presidents' club were on their best behavior. Bonded by the presidency, they rarely criticize one another or the White House\u2019s current occupant \u2014 though Trump has flouted those rules frequently. He has both praised and criticized Carter in recent days, and he complained that flags will still be at half-staff to honor the deceased president during his inauguration.",
      "In one seemingly chilly moment, Trump looked up when Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 whom he defeated in November's hard-fought election \u2014 entered the cathedral, but he didn't move to greet her as she and husband Doug Emhoff took seats directly in front of him and Melania Trump. Nor did Harris acknowledge him.",
      "After the service, Emhoff made a point to turn around and shake hands with Trump.",
      "Obama, with Trump on his left, also turned to his right to chat with Bush. Clinton, with wife Hillary, was the last of the ex-presidents to take a seat and got in some chatter with Bush as well.",
      "The White House said the former presidents also met privately before taking their seats.",
      "Funerals are among the few events that bring members of the presidents' club together. In a way, former President Gerald Ford was there, too: Ford's son Steven read a eulogy for Carter that Ford had written before he died in 2006.",
      "Busy with personal pursuits, charitable endeavors and sometimes lucrative speaking gigs, the former leaders don\u2019t mingle often. They all know the protocol of state funerals well \u2014 each has been involved in planning his own.",
      "During the 2018 funeral for George H.W. Bush, then-President Trump sat with his predecessors and their spouses, including the Carters, and the interactions were stiff and sometimes awkward.",
      "This time, Trump also didn't appear to interact with Hillary Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2016 election.",
      "Trump was seated in the pew in front of his former vice president, Mike Pence \u2014 one of the few times they have coincided at events since Pence refused to overturn the results of the 2020 election after Trump lost to Biden. The two shook hands but didn't speak much beyond that. Pence's wife, Karen, appeared to avoid engaging with the president-elect.",
      "Trump, who largely avoided contact with the former presidents during his first term \u2014 and pointedly did not seek their advice \u2014 has been critical of Republican former presidents, particularly the Bush family, which made him an uneasy member of the former presidents' club. Carter himself didn't particularly relish being a member of the club, at times criticizing its staid traditions.",
      "Many past presidents have built relationships with their predecessors, including Bill Clinton, who reached out to Richard Nixon for advice on Russian policy, and Harry S. Truman, who sought counsel from Herbert Hoover.",
      "One of the first calls Obama made after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 was to George W. Bush to spread the word that the mission had been accomplished, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of \u201cTeam of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's the loneliest job in the world, so usually they reach out and rely on each other,\" said Andersen Brower. \"But Trump didn't have that the first term, so this will just be another four years where he doesn't depend on anyone who came before him.\"",
      "She noted that Carter spent years as a proud Washington outsider and skipped the unveiling of his own portrait to avoid being in the same room with the man who beat him in 1980, President Ronald Reagan.",
      "\u201cCarter and Trump, even though they have the least in common about everything else, are similar,\" Andersen Brower said, \"in just how they approach telling what they actually think.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration\u2019s Title IX rules expanding protections for LGBTQ+ students have been struck down nationwide after a federal judge in Kentucky found they overstepped the president\u2019s authority.",
      "In a decision issued Thursday, U.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves scrapped the entire 1,500-page regulation after deciding it was \u201cfatally\u201d tainted by legal shortcomings. The rule had already been halted in 26 states after a wave of legal challenges by Republican states.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, whose inauguration is days away, previously promised to end the rules \u201con day one\u201d and made anti-transgender themes a centerpiece of his campaign.",
      "The decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti called it a rejection of the Biden administration's \u201crelentless push to impose a radical gender ideology.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause the Biden rule is vacated altogether, President Trump will be free to take a fresh look at our Title IX regulations when he returns to office,\u201d Skrmetti said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department did not immediately comment on the decision.",
      "Some civil rights groups called the ruling a step backward. GLAAD, a leading LGBTQ+ advocacy group, said transgender and nonbinary students are among the most bullied and harassed.",
      "\u201cProtections for the most vulnerable students make the entire school safer and stronger for everyone,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD.",
      "The Biden administration ignited controversy when it finalized the new rules last year. The regulation expanded Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding discrimination based on sex in education, to also prevent discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. It also widened the definition of harassment to include a broader range of misconduct.",
      "Civil rights advocates hailed it as a victory, saying it gave LGBTQ+ students new recourse against discrimination. But it drew outrage from conservatives who said it could be used to protect transgender athletes in girls' sports.",
      "The rule didn't explicitly address athletics and mostly detailed how schools and colleges were required to respond to cases of discrimination and sexual assault. A separate proposal dealing with transgender athletes in sports was put on the back-burner and later revoked after it became a focal point of Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "In his decision, Reeves found the Education Department overstepped its authority by expanding the scope of Title IX.",
      "There\u2019s nothing in the 1972 law suggesting that it should cover any more than it has since Congress created it, Reeves wrote. He called it an \u201cattempt to bypass the legislative process and completely transform Title IX.\u201d",
      "The judge also found that it violated free speech rights by requiring teachers to use pronouns aligning with a student\u2019s gender identity.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment does not permit the government to chill speech or compel affirmance of a belief with which the speaker disagrees in this manner,\u201d Reeves wrote.",
      "Rather than carve out certain aspects of the rule, Reeves decided it was best to toss the regulation in its entirety and revert to a previous interpretation of Title IX. He said his decision will \u201csimply \u2018cause a return to the status quo\u2019 that existed for more than 50 years prior to its effective date.\u201d",
      "Among the biggest critics of the rule was Betsy DeVos, former education secretary during Trump's first term. On the social media site X, she wrote that the \u201cradical, unfair, illegal, and absurd Biden Title IX re-write is GONE.\u201d",
      "Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said Biden's rule \u201cbetrayed the original intent of Title IX by removing longstanding protections that ensured fairness for women and girls.\u201d",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A group studying where to put South Carolina\u2019s first Statehouse monument to an individual African American has decided Robert Smalls\u2019 statue should be staring down a notorious white supremacist who dismantled most of the former slave's work after the Civil War.",
      "The Smalls statue would stand along the sidewalk where thousands of children on field trips walk from buses to the Statehouse each spring. Backers hope that will spur conversations about a man who lived a heroically full life.",
      "Born into bondage, Smalls stole a Confederate ship during the Civil War to sail his family and a dozen others to freedom. He spent a decade in the U.S. House, helped rewrite South Carolina\u2019s constitution to allow Black men equality after the Civil War and then put up a valiant but doomed fight when racists returned to power and eliminated nearly all of the gains Smalls fought for.",
      "The proposal approved unanimously Wednesday by the Robert Smalls Monument Commission now goes to the General Assembly while another group works to raise the millions of dollars needed for Smalls to join the more than two dozen statues and memorials \u2014 many to Confederates and other racists \u2014 that dot the site where a capitol building has sat for more than 230 years.",
      "After the vote, the sponsor of the bill creating the committee, white Republican Rep. Brandon Cox, and one of its first and most ardent backers, Black Democratic Rep. Jermaine Johnson, walked to the proposed site of the statue. They spoke a few minutes to reporters and then were suddenly overcome by emotion and hugged each other tight.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sitting here making history together as Black, white, tall, short, Republican, Democrat \u2014 it\u2019s an amazing thing,\u201d Johnson said.",

      "Robert Smalls was born in 1839 in Beaufort, South Carolina, and died in 1915 in his hometown a free, but somewhat forgotten man tossed aside by a Southern society determined to keep Blacks inferior.",
      "But Smalls' story was too bold and amazing to fade away.",
      "In May 1862, during the Civil War, the steel-nerved ship pilot waited for the ship's white Confederate crew members to leave the vessel for an evening out. Smalls then donned a Confederate uniform, hat pulled low over his dark brow. He mimicked hand signals and whistle toots to get through Confederate checkpoints in the pale moonlight before surrendering the ship to nearby Union soldiers, having secured his family's freedom and that of the other enslaved people on board.",
      "Smalls helped the Union for the rest of the Civil War. After the South lost, Smalls went on to serve in the South Carolina House and Senate before being elected to the U.S. House. He bought his master\u2019s house in Beaufort in part with money made from turning the Confederate ship over to Union forces, then allowed the man\u2019s penniless wife to live there when she was widowed.",
      "Smalls would see a new South Carolina constitution in 1895 wipe out African Americans\u2019 right to vote in a convention led by \u201cPitchfork\u201d Ben Tillman.",
      "Tillman was a governor and U.S. senator who bragged about leading groups of white people who killed Black men who had been trying to vote during the 1876 election, which led to the end of Reconstruction, the return of all-white rule and the collapse of everything for which Smalls had worked.",
      "Smalls' statue, if approved, will face Tillman's direction, staring him down from about a football field away.",
      "Some civil rights groups have called for tearing down statues of Confederates and white supremacists like Tillman, but state law requires legislative approval to remove them or even add language to the monuments detailing their racist deeds, which has been an impossible task in a state dominated by conservative Republicans.",
      "Sculptor Basil Watson's proposal is Smalls dressed in a tuxedo as a congressman at the height of his power. It was chosen over an idea that included multiple versions of Smalls as a riverboat captain and lawmaker.",
      "A statue of one person at the height of power matches the motif of other Statehouse statues honoring men including segregationist U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, Confederate general and former Gov. Wade Hampton and President George Washington, who will also be in the sightline of the Smalls statue, said Mike Shealy, the chairman of the Robert Smalls Monument Commission.",
      "\u201cThe simplicity of the statue of one man on a pedestal who is equal to the other people who are memorialized on our Statehouse grounds is the best depiction,\u201d Shealy said.",
      "A design also allows officials to begin raising money. Cox and Johnson believe it will cost millions to do it right. The more money raised, the taller the statue and the more intricate the design.",
      "\u201cHeck, I'd put a 24-carat gold statue up if we could raise $100 million,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "On one side of the statue's base will be facts about Smalls' life. On another will be a quote from Smalls from 1895 when Tillman and other whites took over the state constitutional convention and tried to put Smalls and other African Americans back in their place.",
      "\u201cMy race needs no special defense, for the past history of them in this country proves them to be the equal of any people anywhere. All they need is an equal chance in the battle of life,\" Smalls said."

      "WASHINGTON -- Jason Carter, the former president\u2019s grandson who now chairs The Carter Center governing board, memorialized his grandfather with blend of personal touches and humor, recognition of Jimmy Carter's intensity and ambition, and his determination to help people whether through politics or out of office.",
      "The younger Carter painted the 39th president as a regular \u201cPawPaw\u201d from a \u201ctiny village\u201d who was able to connect with marginalized people across the world.",
      "Here is a transcript of his remarks at a state funeral for Jimmy Carter:",
      "In my church, we sing a song that says, \u201cFrom the moment that I wake up until I lay my head, I will sing of the goodness of God.\u201d",
      "I don\u2019t know how many people in here can say that. I know I can\u2019t. But my grandfather certainly can. From the moment that he woke up until he laid his head, his life was a testament to the goodness of God.",
      "And I thank all of you for being here to celebrate this life.",
      "To the presidents and first ladies: It is a great honor to have you here. You know the human side of the American presidency like no others. And we appreciate you.",
      "To the vice presidents, other distinguished guests and friends of all kinds: Thank you for being here.",
      "To those of you who came from all across the world: Thank you for being here to celebrate and pay tribute to my grandfather.",
      "I say grandfather, but we call him PawPaw, as many of you know. And we called my grandmother Mom Carter. So we spent our time talking about Mom and PawPaw and mostly, speaking of the human side of the presidency, just letting people know that they were regular folks.",
      "Yes, they spent four years in the governor\u2019s mansion and four years at the White House. But the other 92 years they spent at home in Plains, Georgia. And one of the best ways to demonstrate that they were regular folks is to take them by that home.",
      "First of all, it looks like they might have built it themselves. Second of all, my grandfather was likely to show up at the door in some \u201970s short shorts and Crocs.",
      "And then you\u2019d walk in the house and it was like thousands of other grandparents\u2019 house(s) all across the South. Fishing trophies on the walls. The refrigerator, of course, was papered with pictures of grandchildren and then great grandchildren. Their main phone, of course, had a cord and was stuck to the wall in the kitchen like a museum piece. And demonstrating their Depression-era roots, they had a little rack next to the sink where they would hang Ziploc bags to dry.",
      "And demonstrating that they changed with the times, eventually he did get a cellphone. And one time he called me sort of early on in that process, and on my phone it said, \u201cPawPaw mobile.\u201d So I answered it of course.",
      "I said, \u201cHey, PawPaw.\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cThis is Jason!\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d",
      "I said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything. You called me!\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t call you. I\u2019m taking a picture.\u201d",
      "A nuclear engineer, right? I mean.",
      "They were small-town people who never forgot who they were and where they were from, no matter what happened in their lives. But I recognize that we are not here because he was just a regular guy.",
      "As you heard from the other speakers, his political life and his presidency, for me, was not just ahead of its time. It was prophetic.",
      "He had the courage and strength to stick to his principles even when they were politically unpopular. As governor of Georgia half a century ago, he preached an end to racial discrimination and an end to mass incarceration. As president in the 1970s, as you\u2019ve heard, he protected more land than any other president in history.",
      "Fifty years ago he was a climate warrior who pushed for a world where we conserved energy, limited emissions and traded our reliance on fossil fuels for expanded renewable sources.",

      "Maybe this is unbelievable to you, but in my 49 years, I never perceived a difference between his public face and his private one. He was the same person, no matter who he was with or where he was. And for me, that\u2019s the definition of integrity.",
      "That honesty was matched by love. It was matched by faith. And in both public and private, my grandparents did fundamentally live their lives in effort, as the Bible says, to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with their God.",
      "Sometimes I feel and felt like I shared my grandfather with the world. Today is one of those days. But really, he shared the world with me. The power of an atom. The beauty and complexity of a south Georgia forest. When we fished, he celebrated the majesty of everything from the smallest minnow to that grand circulation of waters. And he shared this love with my boys, taking these Atlanta public school kids out into the fields to show them about row crops and wild plums.",
      "In the end, his life is a love story. And of course, it\u2019s a love story about Jimmy and Rosalynn and their 77 years of marriage and service. As the song says, they were the flagship of the fleet. And rest assured that in these last weeks, he told us that he was ready to see her again.",
      "But his life was also a broader love story about love for his fellow humans, and about living out the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself. I believe that that love is what taught him and told him to preach the power of human rights, not just for some people, but for all people. It focused him on the power and the promise of democracy, its love for freedom, its requirement and founding belief in the wisdom of regular people raising their voices and the requirement that you respect all of those voices, not just some.",
      "That conviction made him a naval officer who believed and demonstrated, as you\u2019ve heard, that the greatest power of America was not the military, but its values. Those values were personal to him, and he lived them both publicly and privately. As you heard (former Carter White House aide) Stu (Eizenstat) say, as president, he gave voice to dissidents, stood up to dictators, brought countries together in peace.",
      "His heart broke for the people of Israel. It broke for the people of Palestine. And he spent his life trying to bring peace to that holy land. And he talked about it at the dinner table. It was the same in public as it was in private. And for the last 40 years, as you\u2019ve heard, he spent his time living out that love and that faith alongside the poorest and most marginalized people in the world. And that work, again, has been based fundamentally on love and respect.",
      "The Carter Center has 3,500 employees, but only a couple hundred in the United States. The rest are spread throughout the countries where we work. Ethiopia, South Sudan, Chad, Bangladesh. And all of the Carter Center\u2019s programs are based on a respect, that same respect for the power of regular people, even if they are in tiny villages miles from anywhere else.",
      "To give one example, we\u2019ve all heard a lot lately about guinea worm disease. It\u2019s an ancient and debilitating disease of poverty, and that disease will have existed from the dawn of humanity until Jimmy Carter. When he started working on this disease there were 3.5 million cases in humans every year. Last year, there were 14.",
      "And the thing that\u2019s remarkable is that this disease is not eliminated with medicine. It\u2019s eliminated essentially by neighbors talking to neighbors about how to collect water in the poorest and most marginalized villages in the world. And those neighbors truly were my grandfather\u2019s partners for the last 40 years.",
      "And as this disease has been eliminated in every village in Nigeria, every village in Sudan or Uganda, what\u2019s left behind in those tiny 600-person villages is an army of Jimmy and Rosalynn Carters who have demonstrated their own power to change their world.",
      "And that is a fundamental truth about my grandfather. It begins where it ends. When he saw a tiny 600-person village that everybody else thinks of as poor, he recognized it. That\u2019s where he was from. That\u2019s who he was. And he never saw it as a place to send pity. It was always a place to find partnership and power, and a place to carry out that commandment to love your neighbor as yourself.",
      "Essentially, he eradicated a disease with love and respect.",
      "He waged peace with love and respect.",
      "He led this nation with love and respect.",
      "To me, this life was a love story from the moment that he woke up, until he laid his head.",
      "I\u2019ll conclude with this. As Andy Young (a civil rights leader, former Atlanta mayor and Carter's ambassador to the United Nations) told me, he may be gone, but he\u2019s not gone far.",
      "The outpouring of love and support that we have felt from you and from around the world has showed how many lives he has touched and how his spirit will live on in many ways.",
      "For us, he\u2019ll be in the kitchen making pancakes. Or in his woodshop finishing a cradle for a great-grandchild. Standing in a trout stream with Mom Carter. Or for me, just walking those Georgia fields and forests where he\u2019s from.",
      "Thank you."

      "Inside Washington National Cathedral, the five men who've occupied the Oval Office since 1993 convened for a rare moment together at Jimmy Carter\u2019s state funeral",
      "Look at their faces \u2014 formal, etched with experience, laden with the weight of momentous decisions. Add up their years: 379 to be exact, enough time to take you back into the mid-1600s, when the notion of the American nation was still more than a century away.",
      "Consider why they were there: to bid farewell to a member of their fraternity who was the last of his generation and whose own life began just a few years after World War I's ashes stopped smoldering.",
      "Bill Clinton. George W. Bush. Barack Obama. Donald Trump. Joe Biden.",
      "Inside Washington National Cathedral on Thursday, the five men who have occupied the Oval Office since 1993 convened for a rare moment together at Jimmy Carter's state funeral. In that one act, they created a momentary timeline of American history, a strand that connects them to the Roosevelts, to Lincoln and to Washington, the first of them. Visible right next to the five, too, were three people who were a heartbeat away from the same position \u2014 Al Gore, Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, the current vice president.",
      "The three coequal branches of the American government were designed to transcend just one person. Yet somehow, with our love of big personalities and our elevation of the individual, the president of the United States became a different breed entirely \u2014 an amalgam of person and office that now occupies a space in the culture like no other.",
      "The American presidency is draped in ritual. \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d is played when a president enters an official event. People stand when a president comes into the room. A protective cocoon envelopes a president\u2019s every move. Speeches are given behind a presidential seal. The office confers an aura that continues up until the moment of an elaborate, dayslong memorial.",
      "That aura \u2014 and the fact that many have hardly been ideological kindred spirits \u2014 is what makes images like those at Carter's service so extraordinary.",
      "Yet it's not merely that these are the fellow citizens who led Americans through the Kosovo war, through the aftermath of 9/11 and the Iraq War, through the rise of the internet and economic calamities, climate change and pandemic. It's not that, adore them or despise them, they rose to the lead the nation and did consequential things \u2014 positive and negative \u2014 in Americans' name.",
      "It's the precise opposite, actually.",
      "To see these men of history shoulder to shoulder in cathedral pews shows that they're human like all of us, and on this day of mourning, they dressed up for a funeral and said farewell to a touchstone of an earlier generation, in a display of unity and continuity. To view them in a single snapshot where no one \u2014 not even the sitting president \u2014 was in charge of the proceedings serves to humanize them. It reinforces the notion that Abraham Lincoln spoke of so many years ago \u2014 \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe power of regular people,\u201d Carter's grandson, Jason Carter, said in his eulogy.",
      "In a country where political money is unfathomable in its amounts and its power, this isn't to say these five men are \u201cregular people.\u201d The power they commanded, command or will command astonishes.",
      "But their power is ultimately limited, and not just by checks and balances. Whatever history thinks in the end of Biden, Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton, it will always have the last word for the five who gathered Thursday \u2014 and the sixth, Carter, for whom they gathered.",
      "Stuart Eizenstat, a longtime Carter friend and adviser, had this to say about the 39th president at the service, but it probably works for all the commanders in chief in attendance: \u201cHe may not be a candidate for Mount Rushmore, but he belongs in the foothills.\"",

      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",

      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",

    "summary": "Experts say the UK has enough gas after Centrica said storage levels were \"concerningly low\".",
    "story": [
      "The UK has enough gas to meet winter demand, the network operator has said, after British Gas owner Centrica warned about \"concerningly low\" storage levels.",
      "Centrica, which owns the country's largest gas storage facility, said the UK had \"less than a week of gas demand in store\" due to colder-than-usual weather.",
      "But National Gas, which owns the UK gas network, said the UK gets its gas from \"a diverse range of sources\" and that storage \"remains healthy\".",
      "Energy analysts said even if gas storage did run low, the UK could buy in more from Europe and other countries.",
      "Centrica has said that UK gas storage facilities are currently about half-full.",
      "\"Plunging temperatures and high demand for gas-fired power stations have reduced UK winter gas storage to concerningly low levels,\" it said.",
      "\"Stubbornly high\" gas prices had made it \"more difficult to top up storage\", the company added.",
      "Parts of the UK are experiencing freezing conditions, with extremely low night-time temperatures forecast in some areas.",
      "Gas central heating is the most common way that households heat their homes. Around three in four households (74%) in England and Wales said it was their only central heating source in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "National Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".",
      "It added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".",
      "Energy prices rise with warnings of more pain to come",
      "Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
      "Given household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.",
      "If there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.",
      "However, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.",
      "Wholesale prices are currently lower than they were at the beginning of the year.",
      "\"There does not appear to be a risk of a physical shortage in UK gas supply this winter,\" said Jack Sharples, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.",
      "As well as LNG, Dr Sharples said the UK still gets some gas from North Sea fields and there are pipelines running to the UK from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.",
      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",
      "It has been pushing the government to say hydrogen will be part of the UK energy mix in the future to justify that investment."

      "For years, there have been rumblings of concern about a potential downturn in the world's largest economy.",
      "It has consistently proved the doubters wrong and last month was no exception.",
      "The job gains in December were much higher than the roughly 160,000 analysts had expected: Employers added 256,00 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped from 4.2% in November to 4.1%, the Labor Department said.",
      "Overall, 2.2 million jobs were added last year - an average of 186,000 a month.",
      "That marked a slowdown from a year earlier, but is still a pretty healthy figure.",
      "Average hourly pay was up 3.9% last month compared with December 2023. It's a solid gain but not one so strong as to worry analysts that fast wage growth will prompt price increases to suddenly accelerate.",
      "Nathaniel Casey, investment strategist at wealth management firm Evelyn Partners, called it \"the goldilocks of labour market releases\".",
      "2. There could be fewer interest rate cuts",
      "The US central bank, which is charged with keeping both prices and employment stable, cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years in September, saying it wanted to head off signs of weakness in the jobs market.",
      "It boosted hopes of many would-be borrowers in the US, who have been facing the highest borrowing costs in roughly two decades and were eager to see them come down.",
      "But the strength of this month's data suggests fears about the jobs market may have been premature, removing pressure on the bank to act.",
      "Interest rates on 10 and 30-year government debt in the US jumped after the report, with the latter topping 5%.",
      "Investors had already been paring back bets on cuts this year, worried by signs that the bank's progress on stabilising prices was stalling.",
      "There are also risks policies called for by President-elect Donald Trump, such as sweeping border taxes and migrant deportations, could raise prices or wages, putting pressure on inflation.",
      "Even if inflation data due next week shows inflation - the rate of price increases -cooling, Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said this jobs data means she doesn't expect the Fed \"to cut rates any time soon.\"",
      "3. Higher US borrowing costs mean higher global rates too",
      "The interest rates set by the US central bank have a powerful influence over borrowing costs for many loans - and not only in America.",
      "Borrowing costs globally have increased in recent months, responding to expectations that US interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer.",
      "In the UK, for example, the interest rate, or yield, on 30-year government debt hit the highest level in more than 25 years earlier this week, putting pressure on the government as it tries to work out its spending and borrowing plans.",
      "While the latest US jobs figures might be good news for the US economy and its dollar, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, warned they would be \"punishing news for global bond markets, particularly UK gilts\", referring to the name of government bonds, or debt.",

      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "It will invest more than \u00a3300 million so it can build more highly-customised versions of its cars for its super-rich clientele.",
      "Although UK petrol and diesel car sales are due to be phased out by 2030, the boss of Rolls-Royce declined to say whether the firm would stop selling cars with combustion engines to clients abroad.",
      "Rolls-Royce sold 5,712 cars in 2024, down from its record of 6,032 in 2023, but the total value of its sales was higher due to it selling more bespoke builds.",
      "While those numbers may seem tiny compared with the millions of cars delivered each year by mainstream manufacturers, Rolls-Royce operates in a highly rarefied market.",
      "The brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.",
      "As a luxury carmaker focused on export markets, Rolls-Royce is insulated from many of the challenges currently facing the wider European motor industry. However, it has been affected by a fall in demand in China, one of its most important markets.",

      "This has included cars with holographic paint, containing one-off artworks, or featuring intricate hand-stitched embroidery. One model, designed as a homage to the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, includes features made out of solid 18-carat gold.",
      "That is generating \"more complicated commissions\" and \"driving the need\" to expand Goodwood to have more space, Rolls-Royce chief executive Chris Brownridge told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "But making individually tailored cars, while profitable, is a labour-intensive process that requires time and space.",
      "At the same time, like other manufacturers, the company is preparing for a future in which conventional cars will be phased out and replaced by electric models.",
      "In the UK, the Labour government has committed to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and is consulting car manufacturers on how that will work.",
      "Mr Brownridge declined to tell the BBC whether the firm would still be building cars with combustion engines for clients abroad in 2030, but said the firm had a \"very clear roadmap\" and that electric cars were the \"right direction for Rolls-Royce\".",
      "A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said under current plans and legislation, Rolls-Royce would still have the capability to build combustion engine cars in 2030, if that is what clients want.",
      "However, he said that five years \"is a long time\", and legislation may change, adding that by then it may not be feasible for the firm to build such cars.",
      "Rolls-Royce said the extension of its factory would \"create additional space\" for building bespoke cars.",
      "It added that the plan would \"also ready the manufacturing facility for the marque's transition to an all-battery electric vehicle future\".",
      "The carmaker has already been granted planning permission for the expansion of the Goodwood plant, which was built in 2003 and initially housed 300 workers. There are currently more than 2,500 people working on the site, with a further 7,500 in the UK supply chain.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

      "\"I was in limbo over my relationship and naively thought I could get the paperwork and move on,\" she said.",

      "But it has been struggling to meet demand.",
      "The government, which described the calculations as \"extremely complex\" and requiring a specialised role to complete, said it aims to clear most of the current backlog by the end of February.",
      "A Freedom of Information request - submitted by a member of a teachers' pensions Cash Equivalent Transfer Valuation (CETV) support group and seen by the BBC - suggests just under 2,000 teachers were waiting for CETV valuations at the start of December 2024.",
      "The Department for Education said that number had dropped to 1,344 as of 6 January 2025, but new cases were always coming in.",
      "Amy, from Bristol, teaches history, geography and psychology at a secondary school in Wiltshire.",
      "She has been waiting since July 2024 for a CETV and cannot get divorced without it.",
      "'Hugely stressful'",
      "Both parties in a divorce need to provide accurate information about their finances - including any property, savings, and pensions - even if the split in assets is otherwise straightforward.",
      "\"I was initially told [the Teachers' Pension Scheme] would be in touch within 10 working days,\" she said.",
      "\"But then the person I spoke to said they had no timescale for the calculations to be completed. So holding my breath was not recommended.\"",

      "He said: \"This is the first time I've ever been divorced, so I hadn't heard of [a CETV] before.",
      "\"It's exhausting. It's taken a toll on me mentally because I want to move on with my life and I'm sure my ex-wife wants to do the same. It's financially taking a toll as well. I'm still paying a mortgage on a house.\"",
      "David has also racked up hundreds of pounds in solicitors' fees because of the protracted divorce process.",

      "\"So that's taken time to agree and then they need expert staff to actually do all of these calculations. All of that is just taking time.\"",
      "The judgement, also known as the McCloud pension remedy, found in 2018 that the government discriminated against younger members of public service pension schemes.",
      "It resulted in the government making changes to public service pension schemes, and calculating valuations in a new way.",
      "Backlog to be cleared",
      "In an update issued on the Teachers' Pensions website in December, the service apologised for the inconvenience caused by the delays.",
      "It said they were due firstly to an embargo on new CETVs between March and July 2023 in order to take account of a change in the way valuations are made.",
      "And once the backlog had built up, new rules came into force after the McCloud judgment meaning that in many cases two calculations were necessary rather than one.",
      "The Department for Education said the delays were not a result of having too few staff and that it was working through cases in date order wherever possible.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 12:11:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The government is suggesting a cap on the cost of resold tickets, potentially up to 30% on top of the original price.",
    "story": [
      "The government has announced plans to cap the price of resale tickets in a clamp-down on ticket touts who bulk buy tickets and then resell them for huge profits.",
      "The cap would apply to tickets in the live events industry including sport, music, comedy and theatre.",
      "It was one of the government's election promises, after complaints from fans and concert-goers about the massively inflated cost of some resale tickets.",
      "A public consultation will now be launched to consider the cap and how much it will be - anywhere from the ticket's face value or up to 30% on top of the original price.",
      "Separately, the government is also putting out a call for evidence on dynamic pricing, which is where the price of tickets rise at times of high demand.",
      "Hundreds of people complained after experiencing dynamic pricing when Oasis tickets went on sale last August, with some fans charged more than \u00a3350 for tickets with an initial face value of \u00a3150.",
      "Oasis ditch dynamic ticket pricing for US gigs",
      "Oasis hit out at Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing after backlash",
      "According to analysis by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), tickets sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.",
      "Investigations by Trading Standards have uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.",
      "Fans for music artists including Coldplay and Taylor Swift have complained that minutes after tickets to their concerts sold out, resale tickets were listed online for thousands of pounds.",
      "The government says its consultation will seek views on capping resale prices on a range, from the original price to up to a 30% uplift.",
      "Ministers are also proposing limiting the number of tickets that resellers can sell, to the maximum they are allowed to purchase in the original ticket sale.",
      "They also want to create new legal obligations for ticket resale websites and apps to oversee the accuracy of information they provide to fans - with Trading Standards and the Competition and Marketing Authority responsible for enforcement.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We are taking action to strengthen consumer protections, stop fans getting ripped off and ensure money spent on tickets goes back into our incredible live events sector, instead of into the pockets of greedy touts.\"",
      "She told BBC Breakfast on Friday: \"This has been going on for years, it's been fleecing fans, and we say time is up for ticket touts, enough is enough.",
      "\"I believe that music belongs to fans, and that fans make the music industry what it is... Fans want to buy tickets but they can't, because I don't know anyone in this country that can afford \u00a31,000... for a ticket.\"",
      "She added: \"Touts are distorting the market because what they're doing is taking those tickets away from fans, inflating the prices and selling them on, so they are denying the fans the price that the ticket company has set and the band want to sell the tickets for, and instead all of that money is pouring into [the touts'] pockets.\"",
      "Alongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.",
      "\"The call for evidence will seek views on how the ticketing system in the live events sector is working for fans and whether the current system provides sufficient protection from unfair practices,\" the governments aid.",
      "Last year, Oasis fans were asked to pay as much as \u00a3350 per ticket, around \u00a3200 more than had been advertised, due to demand.",
      "Previously, Noel and Liam Gallagher said they had not been aware that dynamic pricing would be used for their UK stadium shows next summer - but acknowledged that the roll out of the tickets had not gone as planned.",
      "Ticketmaster has said it does not set prices and that it is down to the \"event organiser\" who \"has priced these tickets according to their market value\".",
      "'Potentially game-changing'",
      "Ticket resale sites have previously defended their services, with Viagogo saying its site ensures resales are \"a secure, safe transaction\".",
      "Viagogo's boss previously told the BBC lots of fans actually prefer buying on Viagogo instead of buying tickets direct.",
      "\"They don't want to be forced to get up on Friday morning and wait in a queue that may or may not happen,\" he says.",
      "In a statement, Viagogo said it would \"continue to constructively engage with the government\".",
      "It added that it will \"look forward to responding in full to the consultation and call for evidence on improving consumer protections in the ticketing market\".",
      "Viagogo boss defends resold Taylor Swift tickets",
      "Meanwhile, Ticketmaster said it would support a cap on the reselling of tickets.",
      "\"Since 2018, our resale has been capped at face value, providing fans a safe place to sell tickets they can't use at the original price set by artists and event organisers,\" it said.",
      "\"We support proposals to introduce an industry-wide resale price cap. We also urge the government to crack down on bots and ban speculative ticket sales.\"",
      "Sarah Cardell, CEO of CMA, added: \"We know from our own work on ticket reselling that fans often have to jump through hoops and can be left out of pocket or turned away at the door.",
      "\"That is why we made recommendations to the previous government to tackle illegal bulk-buying, stop speculative selling and hold platforms accountable for inaccurate ticket information.\"",
      "She said they \"welcome this fresh opportunity to bring in the stronger protections consumers need in this area\".",
      "Fan-to-fan resale site Twickets' founder Richard Davies gave his support to a cap on ticket resale prices, and called on the government to \"investigate a potential cap on booking fees to ensure they remain proportionate and reasonable\".",
      "'Inflated prices'",
      "Campaigners and music artists have welcomed the consultation. UK Music, which represents the UK's music industry, said it wanted a \"clear price cap\".",
      "Musician and DJ Fatboy Slim gave his backing to the government's proposals, saying it was \"great to see money being put back into fans' pockets instead of resellers\".",
      "Labour's Sharon Hodgson, the MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse and has been campaigning for 15 years on the issue, also welcomed the government's proposal.",
      "\"I hope all those who have been affected by the inflated prices, speculative ticket selling or fallen victim to scams that are prolific within the secondary market will get involved in this consultation,\" she said.",
      "FanFair Alliance, a campaign group that was set up against ticket touts, called the measures \"potentially game-changing\".",
      "It pointed to other countries - such as Ireland which banned ticket touting in 2021 - saying it shows \"how legislation to prevent the resale of tickets for profit can massively curb the illegal and anti-consumer practices of online ticket touts and offshore resale platforms. The UK simply needs to follow their example\"."

      "\"What you're hearing is very, very real. We just played it and then had a listen back, and were like, 'Yeah, put it on a vinyl'.\"",
      "That's why the album features a short, aborted performance of Ajala, with Koleoso ordering his bandmates to play harder on the next take.",
      "\"A lot of people think that's a skit, but it was a very real moment,\" he says. \"I wanted the song to go off, but it didn't, so we stopped and tried again.",

      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",

      "There's even a song titled N29, after the night bus Koleso used to catch home from nights out in London.",
      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",
      "Koleoso says his first experience of that liminal reality came after his high school prom.",
      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",

      "\"But music didn't save me. What saved me was the smallest part of me that chose to stay, even when it hurt.",
      "\"My songs might walk beside you, but it's your strength that carries you forward.\"",
      "That empathy is baked into Smith's lyrics. His most affecting songs, such as River and Wait For You, are covenants of support for a friend who's drowning in their troubles.",
      "His breakout hit, Stargazing, is also about a moment of human connection \u2013 looking into the cosmos and realising \"the person we fall in love with has been there our whole life\".",
      "He's previously claimed the track was inspired by a sunset in Malibu, but it turns out that that's a little white lie.",
      "Smith actually came up with the folky, clap-along chorus and its central lyric (\"You and I stargazing/ Intertwining souls\") while eating tacos and salsa with his co-writers, Peter Fenn and Jesse Fink, early last year.",
      "They were so inspired that they demo'd the song in just 15 minutes \u2013 just as the sun was setting over Malibu.",
      "\"Somehow, that moment gave the lyric a meaning,\" says the singer. \"It was an afterthought, but it was a very beneficial afterthought.\"",
      "He started posting snippets of the song online almost immediately, and \"from the very first post, the reaction was explosive\".",
      "There was only one problem: they hadn't finished the verses.",
      "For a month, they frantically traded voice notes and Zoom calls, pulling the song into focus in time for a May release. Since then, it's been streamed more than 600 million times.",
      "\"It's quite wild,\" says the singer. \"It's still getting played, seven or eight months down the line, which is awesome.\"",
      "Smith ended 2024 with a clutch of honours \u2013 from his first Brit Award, to being named BBC Introducing's Artist Of The Year \u2013 and the release of his new EP, \u2026A Minute.",
      "At the start of 2025, he's juggling writing sessions for his debut album with a hectic touring schedule that sees him playing 36 shows in 60 days in 16 countries. But if that sounds daunting, he's prepared.",
      "\"It's a lot, for sure, but I used to stand on the edge of my sofa and pretend I was at Glastonbury. So being able to tour, at whatever scale, is just such a privilege that it doesn't feel like hard work.\"",
      "What's more, he's guaranteed to get free cookies.",
      "One act from the BBC Sound of 2025 top five will be announced on Radio 1 and BBC News every day this week, culminating with the winner on Friday."

    "story": [
      "Known to the world as The Vivienne, James Lee Williams was one of the biggest breakout stars of British drag, and it all started with an impression of Donald Trump in 2019 on the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race UK.",
      "Like many of the drag queens on the show, The Vivienne was unapologetically unique and hilariously straight-talking, but she also had something more: pizzazz.",
      "Described by judge Michelle Visage as \"the best Snatch Game character in the history of the show\", it was The Vivienne's President Trump impression - complete with pouted lips, orange makeup and a floppy blonde wig - in the Snatch Game that won her the show.",
      "That win consolidated The Vivienne's influence in the drag community and her career in the world of TV and musical theatre flourished.",
      "RuPaul's Drag Race UK star The Vivienne dies aged 32",
      "RuPaul's Drag Race UK star The Vivienne dies aged 32",
      "Bold, glitzy and saucy looks",
      "Giving one of the most memorable performances in the Snatch Game is no easy feat, but The Vivienne's highlights from the show go far beyond her Trump impression as she was responsible for some of the show's most iconic moments.",
      "Having adopted the drag name The Vivienne because of a love for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, her weekly outfits on the catwalk were second to none.",
      "On the show, she described her drag style as being \"like a Scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she's had to move back to Liverpool\".",
      "Without a contour line out of place and a perfected walk in stilettos, she wooed the judges with her bold, glitzy and saucy looks.",
      "Her 'Queen Elizabeth walking around Balmoral' outfit, which saw her wear a gold poncho and grey knitted skirt with fluffy ducks attached to it, was one of her most memorable.",
      "Combine that with her doing the floss dance in the outfit and she had viewers, fellow contestants and even RuPaul crying with laughter.",
      "In the final she was described by judge Graham Norton as having \"it all\". Fellow judge Alan Carr added that she had \"trademark wit\" and delivered a \"comedy masterclass\" with her impressions of Trump, Margret Thatcher and Kim Woodburn.",
      "The Vivienne went on to be a contestant in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2022.",
      "Skating to anthems by gay icons",
      "In January 2023, The Vivienne became the first drag queen to appear on Dancing on Ice and was partnered with American skater Colin Grafton.",
      "She finished in third place behind gymnast Nile Wilson and Joey Essex.",
      "The pair skated to songs by gay icons such as Dolly Parton and Cher and particularly excelled in the movies and musical weeks, whether performing to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious or Don't Cry for Me Argentina.",

      "The best Donald Trump impression you\u2019ll probably ever see",
      "Man sentenced for homophobic attack on The Vivienne",
      "Her jaw-dropping ability to skate perfectly from day one meant not only did she never appear in the bottom two, but she also never appeared lower than third on the leader board.",
      "But it was the week five performance that struck a chord with many as James chose not to perform in drag for the first time, confessing that it made him emotional dancing to Beyonce's Halo \"without my armour\".",
      "James was widely praised for their decision, with one person on X saying that \"'The Vivienne skating as James and not in drag in itself is inspiring\".",
      "Channelling the Wicked Witch of the West",
      "Williams starred in a number of theatre shows, most recently in a role that seemed to be the perfect fit - the misunderstood yet strong and compassionate Wicked Witch of the West in the revival of The Wizard of Oz musical.",
      "Starring alongside Aston Merrygold in the UK and Ireland tour, the performer reprised the role in the West End at the Gillian Lynne Theatre last year.",
      "\"I don't have many words to say as this is one huge dream,\" they wrote on Instagram. \"Dream big kids.\"",
      "The Vivienne channelled her Wicked Witch of the West role off-stage in November when she sent heads spinning in her emerald green sequined gown at the European premiere of the Wicked film.",
      "Most recently, she was performing as the Childcatcher on the tour of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and performed just a week ago in Blackpool.",
      "TV appearances",
      "While The Wizard of Oz was The Vivienne's first theatre role, she was no stranger to TV and was able to successfully build a career in television after RuPaul's Drag Race, appearing in a range of programmes including Hunted, Emmerdale and the Great British Sewing Bee.",
      "Over Christmas, The Vivienne appeared on a celebrity special of BBC's Blankety Blank.",
      "In 2020, the Vivienne starred in a six-part series The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood on BBC Three.",
      "The show saw the drag queen document her travels to Los Angeles in order to make a music video and was complete with her classic Northern humour and zingy one-liners.",
      "Not all drag race contestants and winners have been able to build such a successful brand around themselves despite their humour and flawless looks, which is testament to how The Vivienne's personality shone through in all her work."

    "summary": "As pressures on the NHS bite, doctors are facing terrible decisions about who should get a bed.",
    "story": [
      "\"Can that chap sit, do we think?\" asks Dr Raj Paw, a senior consultant in the emergency department at Warwick Hospital.",
      "He is speaking about a patient in his 90s  who was brought in after collapsing at home, where he was found cold and confused.",
      "Now he is stable. Could that open up a bed?",
      "\"If we can get him to sit then he could go into one of the chairs, and that would free up his bed,\" Dr Paw says.",
      "This is the sort of conversation doctors and nurses are having in hospitals up and down the country as a severe flu season puts the NHS under pressure.",
      "More than a dozen hospitals have declared critical incidents - including some of those considered among the best in the country.",
      "Earlier this week, the BBC visited Warwick Hospital. It is run by the South Warwickshire trust, which is one of the top rated in the country and has prided itself on the smooth running of its four hospitals.",
      "But the caseload has been overwhelming this week.",
      "Warwick Hospital has 375 beds and at one point the predicted demand was almost 100 more than that. For the first time ever, it's had to declare a critical incident - the highest alert level in the NHS.",
      "The BBC was there when hospital administrators made the call. Declaring a critical incident is a warning to the local health system that things are getting bad. Often, it frees up hospitals to redeploy doctors and create new temporary ward space.",
      "Over a two-day period, the BBC saw doctors and nurses doing just that: finding stop-gap solutions to treat patients in whatever safe settings could be established.",
      "With emergency departments overflowing, sick people need to be treated in the chairs they're sitting in.",
      "Others have had to wait in ambulances parked outside emergency units for hours before they could even be taken inside.",
      "One such patient is Percy, who is in his 80s and experiencing liver failure. He came to hospital because he had been feeling sick and had lost weight over recent weeks.",
      "Dr Arun Jeyakumar, a senior registrar on the ward, is one of the doctors sent out to check on patients like Percy.",
      "Hopping into the ambulance, he has a brief consultation with him. He tells Percy that everything is being done to get him into the hospital.",
      "Percy smiles back weakly, resigned to the wait.",
      "The paramedic who brought him to the hospital is also resigned: he's seen plenty of cases like Percy's this season.",
      "He turns up the heating in the back of the ambulance and sits down again as Dr Jeyakumar hops out and closes the doors.",
      "Back in the emergency department, doctors, nurses and consultants discuss how to make space for new arrivals.",
      "Beds are at an absolute premium in the hospital. So many patients have arrived that a room near the ambulance entrance has been set up for people considered \"fit to sit\".",
      "Every chair is occupied.",
      "\"It isn't ideal,\" one doctor says. \"But it is safe.\"",
      "Porters have to wheel beds through this open space, between patients being treated in chairs and nurses kneeling on the floor to remove cannulas. Drip stands are shuffled back and forth to make room.",
      "We see a nurse taking a patient, who is still attached to a drip, to the loo in a wheelchair.",
      "She leaves the chair in the corridor and helps the patient in. A porter comes and goes to move the vacant wheelchair.",
      "The nurse dashes back out. \"That's my wheelchair,\" she cries.",
      "We roll it back to her and she starts to laugh. \"You can't take your eye off them for a second or another patient will be in it,\" she says - only half joking.",
      "Elsewhere, Percy makes it from the ambulance to the emergency department, after a three hour wait.",
      "\"It's getting worse,\" he says, wincing as he closes his eyes - but it will be another 12 hours before Percy is admitted to a ward.",
      "When we see him finally being moved, he is contorted in his bed from the pain, clutching onto a sick bowl.",
      "Dr Paw's first job during his rounds is to check the cubicles to see who he can move off beds.",
      "He has a full waiting room just beyond the doors and four ambulances banked up outside.",
      "A woman in the last cubicle he visits is crying. Dr Paw receives an update from a nurse on her condition and orders some morphine.",
      "\"You're in the right place,\" he tells the patient. \"We'll sort out your pain.\"",
      "Dr Paw tells us: \"The people that come in now are sicker than they used to be. And here we are, trying to get them out quicker.\"",
      "He then moves on to a man who was admitted for a heart attack two days ago but is no longer receiving active treatment. Can he safely be moved, Dr Paw wonders.",
      "\"These are the decisions we're being forced to make,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"I'm considering moving a heart attack patient to the waiting room so I can have his cubicle.\"",
      "Another patient Dr Paw saw the previous day is still waiting for a bed in the ward more than 24 hours later.",
      "\"It's rubbish. It's not what should happen,\" Dr Paw says. \"People shouldn't be spending 27, 28 hours in an emergency department.\"",
      "At one point during our time at the hospital we were taken to a bank of screens displaying statistics.",
      "It showed that patients in the emergency department were waiting nearly 30 hours for a bed and there were six ambulances queued up outside. One had been there for four hours.",
      "\"It's the worst I've ever seen it,\" one doctor says.",
      "South Warwickshire Trust stood down the critical incident on Thursday \u2013 it had been in place for 48 hours. Staff told the BBC though that the pressures on the hospital were still intense."

      "Mr Scott strongly denies the allegations, adding: \"Never once did we perform any treatments while the client was showing any signs of swelling, bruising or any other side effect.\"",
      "He said the only complaints Andrea initially made were that she \"wasn't quite happy\" with the treatments, and that was the reason she had \"so many\" follow-up appointments.",

      "But that's what's going viral this year as people take to TikTok to document their progress.",
      "First, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol.",
      "Plus on each of the 75 days, you do two 45-minute workouts, one of them outside, drink more than three litres of water and read 10 pages of a non-fiction book.",
      "Easy, right? Well in case you fancy your chances, two people who have finished the challenge told us what it's really like - and experts have cautioned that if it sounds a bit strict, something more relaxed might work better for you.",
      "'New areas for me to tackle'",
      "Meet 29-year-old Devamsha Gunput, who completed 75 Hard last March whilst working full-time as a digital consultant for a large corporation.",
      "\"It was definitely hard,\" she tells the BBC. \"Also living in Edinburgh, it was dark, wet and cold and you had to do one of the workouts outside.\"",
      "Devamsha says one of the most challenging aspects of 75 Hard was \"setting boundaries\" when visiting her South Asian family so that she could be strict with her diet.",
      "\"Having to exercise twice a day and be strict on my diet were really uncomfortable and new areas for me to tackle, because I hadn't had that conversation before,\" she says.",
      "But since completing the challenge, she's noticing the lasting impacts so far.",
      "\"I exercise a lot more regularly, my reading habits and my relationship with food have transformed,\" she says.",
      "While 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella.",
      "He said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan.",
      "He is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich.",
      "More relaxed variations of the challenge have been popping up on social media recently, called 75 Soft and 75 Medium, in which participants can have the odd alcoholic drink and unhealthy meal while still doing exercise and reading.",

      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",
      "Since completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\".",

      "Pros and cons of the challenge",
      "But the challenge isn't for everyone, which is something strength and conditioning coach Tana von Zitzewitz wants those who are considering it to bear in mind.",
      "\"You need a lot of time, not only for the workouts, but for reading the book - it seems a lot to try and cram into one day,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.",
      "Another aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.",
      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",
      "From a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.",
      "NHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.",
      "He also says that it would need to be compared to a more basic regime, to see if that could achieve the same results.",
      "\"If it's a way for people to get out and be active then I am all for it, but if it's a question of whether this is better than going to the gym three times a week or going for a run once a week and eating healthily, then I am not sure,\" he adds.",
      "Hitting certain criteria isn't the intention of 75 Hard's founder, Mr Frisella. He doesn't set any rules that involve losing a certain amount of weight, for example.",
      "While the challenge encourages people to take progress pictures each day, much of the TikTok content around it focuses on how the person feels at the end rather than how they look, helping to avoid unhealthy fixations with appearance.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 15:52:40 GMT",
    "summary": "An outbreak of the flu-like virus in China is causing concern, but experts say a Covid-like pandemic is unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "A surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic.",
      "Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years.",
      "They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.",
      "What is HMPV, what are the symptoms, and how does it spread?",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, HMPV spreads through direct contact between people, or when someone touches a contaminated surface.",
      "The virus leads to a mild upper respiratory tract infection for most people.",
      "It is usually almost indistinguishable from flu.",
      "Symptoms for most people include a cough, a fever and blocked nose.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus.",
      "It also poses a greater risk to those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, according to Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases specialist in Singapore.",
      "If infected, a \"small but significant proportion\" of immunocompromised people can develop more severe disease where the lungs are affected, with wheezing, breathlessness and symptoms of croup.",
      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "Many other countries in the northern hemisphere - including the US - are also experiencing a growth in rates of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",
      "The World Health Organization (WHO) is monitoring rates of flu-like illness across the Northern hemisphere, and said it has not received any reports of unusual outbreak patterns in China or elsewhere.",
      "It said Chinese authorities have confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses to date.",
      "Is HMPV spreading in the UK?",
      "The incidence of HMPV in the UK has risen steadily since October 2024.",
      "The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA)  does not publish the number of cases recorded.",
      "However its latest data shows the percentage of people testing positive for the disease rose sharply in the third week of December and remained at that higher level the following week.",
      "But the UKHSA says this is completely in line with normal seasonal trends, and the level of the disease being seen in GP surgeries and hospitals is as expected.",
      "Is there any chance of another Covid-like pandemic?",
      "Fears of a Covid-style pandemic are overblown, experts say, noting that such events are typically caused by new viruses, which is not the case with HMPV.",
      "The disease is already globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" said Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",
      "\"I don't think there are currently any signs of a more serious global issue.\"",

      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",

      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "But it is not just a crisis that is placing demands on the health service. It's also depriving the economy of workers with rising numbers of young people being left unable to work.",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

      "UK borrowing costs have been rising in recent months. The cost of borrowing over 10 years hit its highest level since 2008, while the pound has fallen and on Friday dropped below $1.22 against the dollar after stronger-than-expected job figures in the US.",
      "When borrowing costs go up, usually the pound does too, but analysts suggest  wider concerns about the strength of the UK economy have driven sterling lower.",
      "On Thursday, the Treasury ruled out any emergency intervention in the markets, saying they continued to \"function in an orderly way\".",
      "Globally, there has been a rise in the cost of government borrowing in recent months sparked by investor concerns that US President-elect Donald Trump's plans to impose new tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China would push up inflation.",

      "Sir John said what was happening to long-term yields in the UK reflected what was happening to yields in the US.",
      "\"[In] the US, markets are taking a different view of how their economy is going to go once President Trump is in office and their rates have gone up to 4.75% on 10-year Treasuries and ours have gone up in parallel to that. So I don't think this is a response to something we've done,\" he said.",
      "On Friday, US hiring figures surged for December, with 256,000 jobs added. Economists had expected 160,000 new roles.",
      "The stronger data, along with a small dip in the unemployment rate, reinforces the view that there is no pressure on the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates quickly in order to boost the economy.",
      "This could impact the path taken by the Bank of England as policymakers closely watch moves made by their counterparts in the world's largest economy.",
      "In response to the figures, the yield on 10-year US bonds rose to almost 4.79%, the highest in 14 months.",
      "The yield on UK 10-year gilts, meanwhile, remained above 4.8%, the highest since August 2008.",
      "Sir John said what was different about the UK was the Treasury had tried to reassure markets by saying it would stick to its fiscal rules.",
      "\"But it's becoming clearer and clearer that that's going to be very difficult,\" he said.",
      "Reeves has previously committed to only one fiscal event a year - where she can raise taxes - which would likely be in a Budget in the autumn.",
      "If she needs more money before that, a squeeze on spending is more likely.",

    "summary": "Why Rachel Reeves needs a more detailed growth strategy - and soon.",
    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",
      "Pursuing green growth by borrowing for long-term capital investment is a potential strategy, and it underpinned \"Bidenomics\" in the US. The incoming government embraced the rhetoric of US policy under the outgoing president, without the same firepower. \"Bidenomics without the money\", you might say.",
      "But now the new Trump administration is jettisoning this approach, rightly or wrongly, and the markets are less convinced that such a strategy will pay for itself. It will cost more to fund such a strategy, and require harsher trade-offs than expected.",
      "Bidenomics without the money and without Biden is much too thin. A more detailed strategy for sustained growth is needed, and in short order.",

    "summary": "Experts say the UK has enough gas after Centrica said storage levels were \"concerningly low\".",
    "story": [
      "The UK has enough gas to meet winter demand, the network operator has said, after British Gas owner Centrica warned about \"concerningly low\" storage levels.",
      "Centrica, which owns the country's largest gas storage facility, said the UK had \"less than a week of gas demand in store\" due to colder-than-usual weather.",
      "But National Gas, which owns the UK gas network, said the UK gets its gas from \"a diverse range of sources\" and that storage \"remains healthy\".",
      "Energy analysts said even if gas storage did run low, the UK could buy in more from Europe and other countries.",
      "Centrica has said that UK gas storage facilities are currently about half-full.",
      "\"Plunging temperatures and high demand for gas-fired power stations have reduced UK winter gas storage to concerningly low levels,\" it said.",
      "\"Stubbornly high\" gas prices had made it \"more difficult to top up storage\", the company added.",
      "Parts of the UK are experiencing freezing conditions, with extremely low night-time temperatures forecast in some areas.",
      "Gas central heating is the most common way that households heat their homes. Around three in four households (74%) in England and Wales said it was their only central heating source in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "National Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".",
      "It added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".",
      "Energy prices rise with warnings of more pain to come",
      "Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).",
      "Given household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.",
      "If there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.",
      "However, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.",
      "Wholesale prices are currently lower than they were at the beginning of the year.",
      "\"There does not appear to be a risk of a physical shortage in UK gas supply this winter,\" said Jack Sharples, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.",
      "As well as LNG, Dr Sharples said the UK still gets some gas from North Sea fields and there are pipelines running to the UK from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.",
      "The government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".",
      "Hydrogen push",
      "Gas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.",
      "The UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.",
      "About half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.",
      "This was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "There is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.",
      "If the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.",
      "Centrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.",
      "It has been pushing the government to say hydrogen will be part of the UK energy mix in the future to justify that investment."

      "\"We had a very good meal,\" the foreign secretary said on Thursday. \"We had a long time to discuss the issues. He was an extremely gracious host, very affable, very warm indeed about our great country.\"",
      "And throughout a series of media interviews, briefings and a speech at the Foreign Office, Lammy talked up UK-US relations, even daring to speak of a \"special relationship\", a phrase largely avoided by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "The UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.",
      "They include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.",
      "But what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.",
      "The president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric.",
      "His language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".",
      "He said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.",
      "\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said.",
      "\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"",
      "Musk looms large over UK politics as MPs return for 2025",
      "How Elon Musk seized on baseless memo claim to fuel wave of misinformation",
      "Lammy played down the influence of Elon Musk, the wealthy ally of Trump who in recent days has personally attacked British ministers on X. He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.",
      "The foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "Lammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is.",
      "When applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.",
      "And as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset.",
      "He and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister.",
      "In the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected."

      "Speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said using counter-terrorism tactics like freezing smugglers' bank accounts will allow the UK to \"break\" their business model.",
      "Under the plans announced this week, the government will also be able to freeze assets of \"those that help to get people into this country\" illegally and launch travel bans.",
      "Critics have argued the measures are too minor to stop small boat crossings.",

      "Suspected people smugglers face phone and travel ban",
      "People smugglers to have finances targeted with sanctions",
      "The new sanctions plans are designed to disrupt the flow of money and could be imposed on companies and individuals aiding illegal migration, including those that manufacture materials for small boat crossings.",
      "The proposed measures, which are yet to be finalised, would mean UK-based individuals and financial institutions would be banned by law from dealing with sanctioned groups.",
      "The government will bring forward new legislation for the scheme, drawn up by government sanction experts alongside law enforcement and Home Office staff.",
      "Many smugglers operate in an informal cash-based network, making it hard for the authorities to target their assets.",

      "The new plans were \"very similar to the powers we have used against terrorists, which allows us to seize their assets, to stop them travelling, and to put them out of business.\"",
      "\"And so that is a really important step,\" Sir Keir said.",
      "He also hailed the plans as \"a world first\".",
      "The fact people smuggling is \"so lucrative\" is the \"very reason we need to go for the money\", he said.",
      "\"The people running this trade are only interested in the amount of money that they can make, and if you can break that model, you can reduce that organized crime.\"",
      "The new powers would work in tandem with other policies announced by Sir Keir, including extra funding for the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the UK's new Border Security Command (BSC) to make more arrests.",
      "\"The power of the sanctions is you can do it much more quickly at a much earlier stage\" than arrests, Sir Keir added - letting law enforcement stop offenders earlier.",
      "Sir Keir said the new policy draws on lessons he learned as Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from 2008 to 2013, before entering politics.",
      "He said: \"As I learned as a chief prosecutor, follow the money, break the model.\"",
      "Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \"Labour has no credibility on dealing with the evil trade in people smuggling.",
      "\"In Parliament they voted against tougher punishments and life sentences for people smugglers, abolished the Rwanda deterrent and campaigned in favour of the rights of dangerous criminals and foreign national offenders, over the safety of the British people.",

      "In his speech, Reed he was \"sorry\" decisions had upset farmers but argued \"stable finances are the foundation of the economic growth needed\".",

      "Intervening, Anderson responded he was \"astounded\" and asked Yemm to agree to a \"one-strike and you're out\" rule instead.",
      "Yemm answered \"that's exactly what I'm saying\", adding victims - the majority of them women - had to \"endure... many, many years of suffering under this type of abuse\" and too many were then told no action could be taken.",
      "\"This should be a zero tolerance policy,\" Yemm said, adding council powers should be bolstered so upstanding citizens could enjoy \"peace and security\" in their homes.",
      "Another Labour MP, Andrew Cooper, said the authorities also needed to stop dumping tenants \"grappling with addiction\" into social housing without adequate support and called for more preventative action.",
      "Liberal Democrat housing spokesman Gideon Amos said the best deterrent would be better funding for police and councils to use the powers they already have.",
      "He set out how existing powers already allowed for \"one strike\" eviction in the worst cases, so Anderson's plan would only \"make the law weaker and give comfort to the most antisocial culprits\".",
      "The MP for Taunton and Wellington, who is also a social housing landlord, added: \"Simply evicting tenants onto the streets won't reduce antisocial behaviour, it will move the antisocial behaviour from the house to the street where all the evidence suggest it will only get worse.\"",

      "The Conservative MP said: \"It's good to see across the House today we seem to be in violent agreement about the three strikes policy, which seems to be a maximum not a minimum.\"",
      "Housing minister Alex Norris called attention to the Labour government's Safer Streets focus on boosting police numbers to tackle antisocial behaviour and the new Respect Orders, which he said should be toughened up.",
      "He said: \"Crucially I think there is a significant gap at the moment for those who make persistent offences, that those penalties [should] grow and are serious ones.\"",
      "Norris said there was also ongoing work on the Renters' Rights Bill, with new powers for social landlords to seek evictions \"immediately in the most serious cases\" and for judges to take the offenders' engagement with efforts to support them into account.",
      "However, he also highlighted how a home could be \"a real foundation\" for families and said there should still be a focus on supporting those, particularly single mums, who were struggling."

      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the last few days. On Tuesday it was worth $1.25 but is currently trading at $1.23.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",

      "It did, however, approve 89% of planning applications for housing in the year to June 2024, considerably higher than the national rate of 71%.",
      "Portsmouth, on the south coast, also has a very stretching target. The local council is being asked to deliver 1,021 new homes per year, almost nine times the 120 it delivered on average over the most recent three years.",
      "Hastings has been tasked with a smaller total: 710. But this is still five times the 142 it has delivered on average in recent years.",
      "Portsmouth approved 74% of residential planning applications in the year to June 2024 and Hastings 75%.",
      "Councils were consulted on the targets last summer, with many expressing concerns they were \"unrealistic\", and the numbers were revised.",

      "Councillor Darren Sanders, cabinet member for housing at Portsmouth City Council, said the target \"does not work\" because \"most of the city is an island\" with a dense population and \"important heritage and natural assets\".",
      "\"Portsmouth has approved more than 4,000 new homes in 2023 and 2024. Any lack of delivery is down to the rising cost of development,\" he said, \"not whether the council approves them.\"",

      "There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials including bricks and timber.",
      "The Construction Leadership Council has warned a shortage of these could hinder the government's ability to get near its target.",
      "Finally, many housing experts doubt private housebuilders are capable of delivering enough new homes each year to reach the targets.",
      "This is because private housebuilders have a commercial interest in not building so many new homes that their average price declines.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",

      "The term \"child prostitute\" was taken out of the law in 2015 as it could imply that children could consent to abuse.",
      "Circulars and memos are received by senior individuals in each police force, former Chief Constable of Norfolk Constabulary Simon Bailey told BBC Verify.",
      "\"They would've gone to crime registrars and the head of the crime and they would've cascaded the guidance,\" he said.",
      "If there was any doubt about how to interpret the guidance a force would have gone back to the Home Office to seek clarity, Mr Bailey added.",
      "\"And even going back 17 years, I cannot believe the Home Office would've sent out a circular of that nature.\"",
      "'Never been any truth'",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the Home Office said it had never instructed police not to go after grooming gangs:",
      "\"There has never been any truth in the existence of a Home Office circular telling police forces that grooming gangs should not be prosecuted, or that their victims were making a choice, and it is now clear that the specific circular which was being referred to does absolutely no such thing.\"",
      "Jacqui Smith - now Baroness Smith - was the Labour Home Secretary in 2008. She told BBC Verify: \"It is categorically wrong that the Home Office or I instructed police forces not to prosecute grooming gangs or not to protect young girls.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said:  \"There is no basis for such allegations at all. They are a complete fabrication. There is no foundation whatsoever for alleging that Mr Brown sent, approved or was in anyway involved with issuing a circular or statement to the police because it did not happen.\"",
      "'Got lost in translation'",
      "BBC Verify has attempted to speak to those who repeated the claim on X and had their posts amplified by Mr Musk.",
      "In one post, Mr Musk alleged that \"Gordon Brown committed an unforgivable crime against the British people\" and shared a video clip from campaigner Maggie Oliver appearing on GB News.",
      "In the clip, Ms Oliver alleged: \"Gordon Brown sent out a circular to all the police forces in the UK saying 'do not prosecute these rape gangs, these children are making a lifestyle choice'.\"",
      "Ms Oliver said that she based her claim on what Mr Afzal said:",
      "\"My knowledge of this comes from what Nazir Afzal said publicly in 2018 in his BBC interview.\"",
      "BBC Verify also reached out to June Slater, whose post was also amplified by Mr Musk. She told us she had not seen the memo, but her claim was also based on what Mr Afzal and Ms Oliver had previously said:",
      "\"I thought he was a reliable source as is Maggie Oliver.\"",
      "Asked if he regretted the misinformation that had stemmed from his statements, Mr Afzal told BBC Verify:",
      "\"I regret that people have interpreted what I interpreted and that it's sort of got lost in translation.\"",
      "BBC Verify also contacted the Police Federation, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) and the College of Policing about the alleged circular.",
      "The NPCC referred us to the Home Office's statement  while the College of Policing said it was not aware of any circular.",
      "'Allegations ignored'",
      "While there is no evidence for the existence of the circular, the performance of the police and other institutions in protecting victims and investigating abuse has been heavily criticised during this period.",
      "Prof Alexis Jay - who carried out the independent inquiry into child abuse - said some victims would never recover from their experiences.",

    "summary": "The Chancellor may face the prospect of breaking her own Budget rules",
    "story": [
      "Economists have warned that the government is \"on course\" to miss its own Budget borrowing targets after interest rates for UK long-term borrowing rose to their highest levels this century.",
      "The official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will start the process of updating its forecast next month to be presented to parliament in late March.",
      "The rising cost of borrowing means \"there is a significant chance that the OBR will judge that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on course to miss her main fiscal rule\", according to Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics.",
      "The yield on the 30-year gilt reached 5.35% on Wednesday, surpassing a previous high in August 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on a 10 year bond surged on Wednesday to its highest since October 2008, to reach 4.784%.",
      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",
      "The clear indication from the government is that although they will not hold another Budget in March, any necessary adjustment would have to come in terms of some new spending cuts.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a \u00a32bn auction of 30 year UK government debt sold at an effective interest rate of 5.18%.",
      "The Debt Management Office, a part of Treasury, effectively paid the highest interest rates for these very long term loans that have been since 1998.",
      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",

      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation.

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 04:13:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Last year was the world's warmest on record, bringing temperatures above a politically symbolic milestone.",
    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",

    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",

      "What does net zero mean?",
      "As a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.",
      "Back in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.",
      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",
      "Britain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.",
      "On around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.",
      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",
      "Last month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.",

    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",

      "Several destinations for the whales have been proposed but there is disagreement on where they should go and what should happen to them.",
      "Most experts agree that releasing the two whales, which are Icelandic orcas specifically, into the wild would not be suitable as both were born in captivity and would not have the skills to survive.",

      "He eventually left with a pod of orcas he had joined and swam to Norway where he died in 2003 following an infection.",

      "She later said that a warning placed on TikTok to users would not be enough to address concerns about its ties to China, and would not adequately address the issues of national security.",

      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

    "summary": "A study in The Lancet suggests Gaza ministry of health figures over a nine-month period might be too low.",
    "story": [
      "The Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza could be substantially higher than official figures reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests.",
      "The UK-led study covered the first nine months of the war, which began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.",
      "It used data from the ministry, an online survey of relatives reporting fatalities, and obituaries. It estimated that up until 30 June 2024, 64,260 Palestinians died from traumatic injury, meaning an under-reporting of deaths by 41%.",
      "The Israeli embassy in the UK said \"any information that derives from Gaza cannot be trusted\" and served Hamas.",
      "The UN treats the health ministry's figures as reliable.",
      "The ministry's figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but a recent report by the UN said the majority of verified victims over a six month period were women and children.",
      "Israel says Hamas's figures cannot be trusted. In August, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had \"eliminated over 17,000 terrorists\", though it is unclear how it arrived at this figure. The IDF insists it only targets combatants and tries to avoid or minimise civilian casualties.",
      "Israel is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it difficult to verify the facts on the ground.",
      "The team behind the latest study used a statistical method called \"capture-recapture\", a technique which has been used to evaluate deaths in other conflicts.",
      "Researchers looked at how many people turned up repeatedly in different attempts to count deaths. The level of overlap between those lists suggested that the number of deaths directly caused by traumatic injury in the conflict could be significantly higher than hospital figures published by the Ministry of Health.",
      "Gaza's health ministry issues updated death tolls from the war daily. It compiles the figures from deaths recorded in hospitals, deaths reported by family members, and deaths from \"reliable media reports\".",
      "The report in The Lancet estimated a death toll between 55,298\u201378,525 people, compared to 37,877 reported by the health ministry.",

      "For example, identifying deaths by \"traumatic injury\" in each set of data could be tricky. Getting it wrong could push the study's estimates higher or lower.",
      "The research also said 59% of those killed for whom data on sex and age was available were women, children and the elderly.",

      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",

      "The sentence in the hush-money payment case means the incoming president has been spared any penalty, including jail time or a fine, but he will still take office as the first US president with a felony conviction.",
      "\"Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,\" Justice Juan Merchan said shortly before announcing the sentence, calling it a \"truly extraordinary case\".",

      "Trump hush-money sentencing live updates",
      "Trump hush-money sentencing live updates",
      "It was the first time in this year-and-half long legal saga that Trump had uttered more than a \"not guilty\" or given a brief affirmative answer.",
      "Granted the chance to speak ahead of his sentencing, Trump railed against the case for several minutes.",
      "\"This has been a very terrible experience,\" he said.",
      "He claimed there had been a \"weaponisation\" of the judicial system and claimed the case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for political reasons.",
      "\"I would like to explain that I was treated very, very unfairly, and I thank you very much,\" he said, before falling silent.",
      "As Bragg watched Trump address him directly for the first time, he maintained a mostly stoic expression. He did, however, chuckle when Trump claimed Bragg had never wanted to bring the case.",
      "After Trump had his say, Justice Merchan then took several moments to reflect on the \"paradox\" of the trial.",
      "Justice Merchan noted that despite the media and political circus outside, \"once the courtroom doors were closed, it was no more unique than all the other cases taking place at the same time\".",
      "But he added that after Trump was convicted, the case took another turn when the American people elected him in November to a second presidential term.",
      "After careful consideration, he had determined that \"the only lawful sentence, without encroaching upon the highest office of the land\", was unconditional discharge - a sentence that would allow the American people a president unencumbered by pending court proceedings.",
      "The end of a historic trial",
      "Trump was found guilty by a New York jury of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May 2024. His sentencing was delayed multiple times due to Supreme Court rulings and the November presidential election.",
      "The charges stemmed from a plot to cover up a hush-money payment to an adult film star in the waning days of the 2016 election. Prosecutors argued the payment was a form of election interference aimed at keeping vital information from voters, and therefore broke the law.",
      "In October 2016, Trump's then-attorney, Michael Cohen, paid a woman named Stormy Daniels $130,000 (\u00a3106,000) to remain silent about a years-old alleged sexual encounter with the soon-to-be president.",
      "After he was elected, Trump reimbursed Cohen in installments \u2013 and then falsely recorded them as legal expenses. Each of Trump's guilty verdicts correlates to a false document related to the cover-up.",

      "The six-week trial became a legal, political and media firestorm. Larger-than-life characters like Cohen and Daniels took the stand to face questioning from Trump's attorneys.",
      "Trump brought a string of family members and Republican allies to court with him each day to fill the benches behind his defence table. Each day, he turned a small media pen in the hallway outside the courtroom into his personal pulpit, using the opportunities to rail against the justice system, the press, and other adversaries.",
      "Trump also used the furore of the trial to raise millions from supporters for his legal battles, and his campaign to retake the White House.",
      "In the four years between his terms in office, Trump was indicted in four separate criminal cases, including his New York case. In the end, this was the only one to go to trial.",
      "On the campaign trail and social media, Trump used his legal quagmires to portray himself \u2013 and his supporters \u2013 as victims of a rigged justice system.",
      "Despite the multiple indictments, including two that centred on his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Trump decisively defeated Vice-President Kamala Harris in November.",
      "His victory quashed the two federal prosecutions against him, including his federal election interference case and one involving alleged mishandling of classified documents. The third, an election interference case in Fulton County, Georgia, has been stuck in a series of delays and side dramas for months.",
      "Only Trump's hush-money trial ever reached its conclusion, after Justice Merchan dug his heels in early January and demanded Trump appear virtually or in person for his sentencing.",
      "The battles did not stop there, however. Trump's lawyers frantically filed appeals and even petitioned the US Supreme Court to halt the Friday hearing.",
      "The Supreme Court rejected him in a brief order issued Thursday night.",

      "Copenhagen's gloomy January weather matches the mood among Denmark's politicians and business leaders.",
      "\"We take this situation very, very seriously,\" said Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen of Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland \u2013 and punish Denmark with high tariffs if it stands in the way.",
      "But, he added, the government had \"no ambition whatsoever to escalate some war of words.\"",
      "Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed Trump's own suggestion that the US might use military force to seize Greenland. \"I don't have the fantasy to imagine that it'll ever get to that,\" she told Danish TV.",
      "And Lars Sandahl Sorensen, CEO of Danish Industry, also said there was \"every reason to stay calm... no-one has any interest in a trade war.\"",
      "But behind the scenes, hastily organised high-level meetings have been taking place in Copenhagen all week, a reflection of the shock caused by Trump's remarks.",
      "Greenland PM Mute Egede flew in to meet both the prime minister and King Frederik X on Wednesday.",
      "And on Thursday night, party leaders from across the political spectrum gathered for an extraordinary meeting on the crisis with Mette Frederiksen in Denmark's parliament.",
      "Faced with what many in Denmark are calling Trump's \"provocation,\" Frederiksen has broadly attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, repeatedly referring to the US as \"Denmark's closest partner\".",
      "It was \"only natural\" that the US was preoccupied by the Arctic and Greenland, she added.",
      "Yet she also said that any decision on Greenland's future should be up to its people alone: \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders... and it's the Greenlanders themselves who have to define their future.\"",
      "Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",
      "Russia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland",
      "Ros Atkins: Why is Trump threatening to annex Greenland?",
      "Her cautious approach is twofold.",
      "On the one hand, Frederiksen is keen to avoid escalating the situation. She's been burned before, in 2019, when Trump cancelled a trip to Denmark after she said his proposal to buy Greenland was \"absurd\".",
      "\"Back then he only had one more year in office, then things went back to normal,\"  veteran political journalist Erik Holstein told the BBC . \"But maybe this is the new normal.\"",
      "But Frederiksen's comments also speak to the Danish resolve not to meddle in the internal affairs of Greenland \u2013 an autonomous territory with its own parliament and whose population is increasingly leaning towards independence.",
      "\"She should've been much clearer in rejecting the idea,\" said opposition MP Rasmus Jarlov.",
      "\"This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting,\" he told the BBC, although he admitted Trump's forcefulness had \"surprised everybody.\"",
      "The conservative MP believed Frederiksen's insistence that \"only Greenland... can decide and define Greenland's future\" placed too much pressure on the island's inhabitants. \"It would've been prudent and clever to stand behind Greenland and just clearly state that Denmark doesn't want [a US takeover].\"",
      "The Greenland question is a delicate one for Denmark, whose prime minister officially apologised only recently for spearheading a 1950s social experiment which saw Inuit children removed from their families to be re-educated as \"model Danes\".",
      "Last week, Greenland's leader said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism.\"",
      "By doing so he tapped into growing nationalist sentiment, fuelled by interest among Greenland's younger generations in the indigenous culture and history of the Inuit.",
      "Most commentators now expect a successful independence referendum in the near future. While for many it would be seen as a victory, it could also usher in a new set of problems, as 60% of Greenland's economy is dependent on Denmark.",
      "An independent Greenland \"would need to make choices,\" said Karsten Honge. The Green Left MP now fears his preferred option of a new Commonwealth-style pact \"based on equality and democracy\" is unlikely to come about.",
      "Sitting in his parliamentary office decorated with poems and drawings depicting scenes of Inuit life, Honge said Greenland would need to decide \"how much it values independence\". It could sever ties with Denmark and turn to the US, Honge said, \"but if you treasure independence then that doesn't make sense.\"",
      "Opposition MP Jarlov argues that while there is no point in forcing Greenland to be part of Denmark, \"it is very close to being an independent country already\".",
      "Its capital Nuuk is self-governed, but relies on Copenhagen for management of currency, foreign relations and defence - as well as substantial subsidies.",
      "\"Greenland today has more independence than Denmark has from the EU,\" Jarlov added. \"So I hope they think things through.\"",
      "As Mette Frederiksen has the awkward task of responding firmly while not offending Greenland or the US, the staunchest rebuttal to Trump's comments so far has come from outside Denmark.",
      "The principle of the inviolability of borders \"applies to every country... no matter whether it's a very small one or a very powerful one,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned, while French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the EU would not let other nations \"attack its sovereign borders\".",
      "Their comments gave away the deep concern within the EU about how to handle the upcoming Trump presidency. \"This is not just very serious for Greenland and Denmark \u2013 it is serious to the whole world and to Europe as a whole,\" MP Karsten Honge said.",
      "\"Imagine a world \u2013 which we may be facing in just a few weeks \u2013 where international agreements don't exist. That would shake everything up, and Denmark would just be a small part of it.\"",
      "The Danish trade sector has similarly been engulfed by deep nervousness after Trump said he would \"tariff Denmark at a very high level\" if it refused to give up Greenland to the US.",
      "A 2024 Danish Industry study showed that Denmark's GDP would fall by three points if the US imposed 10% tariffs on imports from the EU to the US as part of a global trade war.",
      "Singling out Danish products from the influx of EU goods would be near-impossible for the US, and would almost certainly result in retaliatory measures from the EU. But trade industry professionals are taking few chances, and in Denmark as elsewhere on the continent huge amounts of resources are being spent internally to plan for potential outcomes of Donald Trump's second term in the White House.",
      "As his inauguration approaches, Danes are preparing as they can to weather the storm. There is guarded hope that the president-elect could soon shift his focus to grievances towards other EU partners, and that the Greenland question could be temporarily shelved.",
      "But the disquiet brought on by Trump's refusal to rule out military intervention to seize Greenland remains.",
      "Karsten Honge said Denmark would have to suffer whatever decision the US takes.",
      "\"They just need to send a small battleship to travel down the Greenland coast and send a polite letter to Denmark,\" he said, only partly in jest.",

      "For many settlers here, the line between the State of Israel, and the territory it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, has been erased from their narrative.",
      "The visitors' audio-guide at the hill-top viewpoint describes the West Bank as \"a region of Israel\" and the Palestinian city of Nablus as the place where God promised the land to the Jews.",
      "But formal annexation of this territory has so far remained a dream for settlers like Sondra, even while settlements - viewed as illegal by the UN's top court and most other countries - have mushroomed year after year.",
      "Now many see an opportunity to go further, with the election of Donald Trump as the next US president.",
      "\"I was thrilled that Trump won,\" Sondra told me. \"I very much want to extend sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. And I feel that's something Trump could support.\"",
      "There are signs that some in his incoming administration might agree with her.",

      "\"When people use the term 'occupied', I say: 'Yes, Israel is occupying the land, but it's the occupation of a land that God gave them 3,500 years ago. It is their land,'\" he said.",

      "But there are also signs that Israelis lobbying for annexation of the West Bank - some of them in cabinet positions - might be disappointed in Trump's decisions.",
      "Their hopes have been fuelled by memories of his first term as president, during which he broke with decades of US policy - and international consensus - by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which were captured from Syria in 1967.",
      "But supporting annexation of the West Bank would be a much bigger and thornier issue for Trump.",
      "It would likely alienate Washington's other key ally, Saudi Arabia, complicating Trump's chances for a wider regional deal.",

      "\"2025 must be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,\" he said.",

      "Israel has full control over security and planning in 60% of the West Bank on an interim basis, as outlined in the Oslo peace accords three decades ago.",
      "While settlements are expanding, permits for Palestinian homes are almost never granted. And lawyers say demolitions like this are increasing.",
      "\"This is all part of policies to force us to leave,\" Mohaib said. \"It's a policy of forced migration. What difference does it make to them [Israelis] if I build here or not? We pose no threat to them.\"",
      "Palestinians are also increasingly being forced off their land by violent Israeli settlers - who have been sanctioned by the US and UK, but largely left unchallenged by Israeli courts at home.",
      "Activists say more than 20 Palestinian communities in the West Bank have been expelled over the past few years by increasingly violent attacks, and that settlers are now encroaching into new areas outside Israel's interim civil control.",

    "story": [
      "The death of a teenage boy sparked violent protests in a city in north-west China, the BBC has confirmed through verified video.",
      "In the videos shared on social media, protesters can be seen hurling objects at police and officers beating some demonstrators in Pucheng in Shaanxi province.",
      "Authorities said the teenager fell to his death on 2 January in an accident at his school dormitory. But following his death allegations began spreading on social media that there had been a cover-up.",
      "Protests erupted soon after and lasted a few days, before they were apparently quelled earlier this week. The BBC has seen no further evidence of protest in Pucheng since then.",
      "Public demonstrations are not uncommon in China, but authorities have been particularly sensitive about them since the 2022 White Paper protests against Covid policies, which saw rare criticism of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi Jinping.",
      "State media has been silent on the protests in Pucheng. Any clips or mention of the demonstrations have been largely censored from Chinese social media, as is usually the case for incidents deemed sensitive by authorities.",
      "But several videos have been leaked out of China and posted on X.",
      "The BBC has confirmed these videos were filmed at the Pucheng Vocational Education Centre, and found no earlier versions online prior to the reported outbreak of the protests over the past few days.",
      "When contacted by the BBC, a representative from the publicity department of the Pucheng government denied there had been protests. There was no answer when we rang an official handling media queries.",
      "In a statement released earlier this week, local authorities said that the teenager surnamed Dang was a third-year student at the education centre in Pucheng.",
      "Prior to his death, Dang had been woken up in the night by other students chatting in his dormitory, their statement said. He got into an argument and altercation with a boy, which was resolved by a school official.",
      "Later that night, his body was found by another student at the foot of the dormitory block.",
      "The statement described it as \"an accident where a student fell from a height at school\". It added that the police had conducted investigations and an autopsy, and \"at present exclude it as a criminal case\".",
      "But allegations have swirled online for days that there was more to the story and that the school and authorities were hiding the truth. One account claimed, without proof, that Dang killed himself after he was bullied by the boy he'd fought with earlier.",
      "Unverified remarks from his family have been circulating, alleging that the injuries on Dang's body were inconsistent with the authorities' version of events and that they were not allowed to examine his body for long.",
      "The allegations appeared to have incensed many in Pucheng, sparking protests that drew at least hundreds of people.",
      "Bullying has become a highly sensitive topic in China in recent years, with past cases of student deaths triggering protests. Last month, a Chinese court handed out lengthy jail sentences to two teenagers who murdered a classmate.",
      "There are also videos posted on X on Monday, which the BBC has confirmed were filmed at the Pucheng Vocational Education Centre, showing people mourning the teenager's death. They placed flowers and offerings at the entrance of the school, and conducted a traditional mourning ritual by throwing pieces of paper from the rooftop of a school building.",
      "Other videos circulating online appear to show demonstrators, many of them young, storming a building and clashing with police while shouting \"give us the truth\".",
      "One verified clip shows a school official confronted by shouting protesters who shove him around. Others show destroyed offices in the compound, and protesters pushing down a barricade at the school entrance.",
      "Other clips show protesters hurling objects such as traffic cones at groups of retreating police; and officers tackling and detaining people while beating them with batons. Some protesters are seen with blood on their heads and faces.",
      "There is little information on what happened next, but reports on social media suggest a much larger police presence in Pucheng in recent days with no more reports of demonstrations.",

      "Sri Lanka rarely convicts Buddhist monks, but this marks the second time that Gnanasara, who has repeatedly been accused of hate crimes and anti-Muslim violence, has been jailed.",
      "The sentence, handed down by the Colombo Magistrate's Court, comes after a presidential pardon he received in 2019 for a six-year sentence related to intimidation and contempt of court.",
      "Gnanasara was arrested in December for remarks he made during a 2016 media conference, where he made several derogatory remarks against Islam.",
      "On Thursday, the court said that all citizens, regardless of religion, are entitled to the freedom of belief under the Constitution.",
      "He was also given a fine of 1,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($5; \u00a34). Failure to pay the fine would result in an additional month of imprisonment, the court's ruling added.",
      "Gnanasara has filed an appeal against the sentence. The court rejected a request from his lawyers to free him on bail until a final judgment was made on the appeal.",

However, he only served nine months of that sentence because he received a  pardon by Maithripala Sirisena who was the country's president at the time."

    "story": [
      "Indian cricket fans are still reeling from the team's crushing 1-3 defeat in the five-match Test series against Australia.",
      "Once dominant in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with historic victories over the mighty Australians over the past decade, the tourists fell short, exposing vulnerabilities in a side long thought invincible.",
      "The series highlighted glaring issues - Indian batters struggled, and Jasprit Bumrah was the lone bowler to trouble Australia.",
      "The loss not only cost India the coveted Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also denied them a spot in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, breaking their streak of back-to-back appearances in 2021 and 2023, where they lost to New Zealand and Australia respectively.",
      "India's recent form is troubling - they have lost six of their last eight Tests, including a shocking 0-3 home whitewash against New Zealand.",
      "The defeats have raised questions about the team's depth, the future of key players like captain Rohit Sharma and former skipper Virat Kohli, and their ability to rebuild.",
      "With a team in transition and stalwarts fading, Indian Test cricket faces pressing challenges to sustain its legacy in a rapidly evolving landscape.",
      "India's next red-ball challenge is a five-Test series in England starting July. England's conditions, known for dramatic shifts even within a session, will test players' technique, skills and adaptability to the limit.",
      "India hasn't won a series in England since 2007, with only two prior victories (1971, 1986), highlighting the daunting task ahead. Adding to the pressure, recent failures against New Zealand and Australia leave selectors grappling with tough decisions on player selection and team combinations for this critical campaign.",
      "The biggest headache for selectors is the form of batting stalwarts Sharma and Kohli after dismal outings in Australia and earlier against New Zealand.",
      "Sharma managed just 31 runs in three Tests in Australia, with his poor form seeing him dropping himself for the final game. Kohli fared slightly better with 190 runs in nine innings, but 100 runs of his total came in one knock. His dismissals followed a pattern - caught in the slips or behind the stumps - pointing to a glaring technical flaw or mental fatigue under pressure.",
      "Since January 2024, Sharma has managed just 619 runs in 16 Tests with one century. Kohli's numbers are worse over time - averaging 32 in Tests since 2020 with only two centuries.",
      "Once a late-blooming Test opener and blazing match-winner, Sharma now struggles to find his ideal batting position. Meanwhile, Kohli's surreal decline - after a decade of dominance and swagger- has left cricket's former titan in an extended slump.",
      "From Sunil Gavaskar to Sachin Tendulkar to Kohli, the baton of Indian batting greatness has passed seamlessly. But a worthy successor to Kohli remains elusive.",
      "KL Rahul has the class but lacks the hunger for consistent big scores. Rishabh Pant is a thrilling maverick, equally capable of winning or losing a match. Shubman Gill, touted as the next Big Thing, has struggled overseas despite his undeniable pedigree and needs careful nurturing.",
      "Punjab's young left-hander Abhishek Sharma, mentored by Yuvraj Singh, is highly rated, while Nitish Kumar Reddy impressed on debut in Australia with his fearless performances in tough situations.",
      "Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's top Test run-scorer in Australia this series, has been the standout among young batsmen. With panache, patience, technical assurance, and explosive strokes, he looks poised to become Kohli's successor as the team's talisman.",
      "India's talent pool is brimming across departments. Jasprit Bumrah, with his 32-wicket haul against Australia, has cemented his status as a fast-bowling colossus. Backed by Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, and a dozen promising quicks, India boasts a formidable pace arsenal for all formats.",
      "That said, Bumrah is a once-in-a-generation talent and needs careful workload management. Overburdening him, as in the Australia series, risks breakdowns that could impede the attack. Shami, after lengthy stints in rehab, also requires careful handling. Together, they form one of modern cricket's most formidable pace pairs.",
      "With Ravichandran Ashwin's sudden retirement and Ravindra Jadeja's lukewarm showing in Australia, India's spin depth looks thin. However, Washington Sundar has shown promise on home pitches, while young spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Tanush Kotian, who joined the squad mid-series in Australia, are knocking on the doors of Test cricket.",
      "Smarting from recent losses to New Zealand and Australia, the Indian cricket board  is moving swiftly to usher in a transition. Selectors have been directed to shortlist potential Test players from the second round of the domestic Ranji Trophy, resuming 23 January.",
      "All players, including Sharma and Kohli, are likely to be asked to play domestic cricket - a move that could help them regain form.",
      "Managing a team in transition poses complex challenges requiring patience, empathy, and clear vision. Knee-jerk reactions or external pressure could worsen the situation instead of providing solutions.",
      "Whether Sharma and Kohli can overcome their crisis remains to be seen, but India's wealth of talent should lift the current gloom surrounding Indian cricket.",
      "It's worth recalling that in 2011, after winning the ODI World Cup, India was whitewashed 4-0 in Test series against England and Australia. Cricket seemed to hit rock bottom.",
      "But, within months, a revival led by young talents like Kohli, Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Jadeja, Ashwin, and others saw India rise to become the world's top team across formats, holding that position for nearly a decade."

      "There he would go through what he describes as the worst experience of his life.",
      "\"When we arrived at Tocor\u00f3n, they stripped us, beat us, and insulted us. We were forbidden to raise our heads and look at the guards; we had to lower our heads to the floor,\" Juan recounts.",

      "Dinner was sometimes at 21:00, and sometimes at 02:00.",
      "\"Apart from waiting for meals, there was nothing else to do. We could only walk around inside the small cell and tell stories. We also talked about politics, but in low voices, because if the guards heard us, they would punish us.\"",

    "summary": "Many Chinese are now asking: what about their loved ones still trapped in scam centres?",
    "story": [
      "A small-time Chinese actor had been missing for two days in Thailand when his girlfriend decided to ask the internet for help.",
      "\"We have no choice but to borrow the power of the internet to amplify our voices,\"  Wang Xing's girlfriend wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo on 5 January.",
      "The plea went viral after it was shared by some of China's biggest celebrities, including singer Lay Zhang and actor Qin Lan.",
      "Wang, 31, had the country's attention - as well as that of his government.",
      "On 7 January, Wang was rescued from a scam centre across the border, in Myanmar - news met with a wave of relief.",
      "But the swift yet mysterious rescue has also led to questions about the fate of those who remain trapped inside the scam centres. The case is a grim reminder of the thriving criminal businesses that still entrap hundreds of thousands of people, forcing them into cybercrime.",
      "Families of Chinese nationals who may be being held in one of these compounds have started a petition urging their government to help them too. The petition document is shared online for anyone to fill in cases of their missing ones. The number of cases has already climbed to more than 600 from the initial 174, and is still increasing.",
      "Wang told the police that there were around 50 Chinese nationals held in the same place as him alone.",
      "\"We are desperate to know if the remaining Chinese nationals [who were] with him have been rescued,\" reads one top-liked comment on Weibo.",
      "\"Other people's lives are also lives.\"",

      "Lured and trapped into scam slavery in South East Asia",
      "Wang went missing on 3 January in the Thai border city of Mae Sot, which has become a hub for trafficking people into Myanmar.",
      "He had flown to Bangkok for an acting job offered to him on WeChat. The person claimed to represent a major Thai entertainment company, according to Thai police.",
      "The actor later told reporters that he had been on a shoot in Thailand around 2018 and did not suspect this was any different. But he was picked up in a car and taken to Myanmar, where his head was shaved and he was forced to undergo training on how to scam people on phone calls.",
      "His girlfriend wrote on Weibo that she and his brother tried to track him down and get police involved, but \"there had been little results\": Chinese police had yet to register a case, while the embassy in Thailand had simply advised Wang's family to approach the police in Mae Sot.",
      "But as discussions of Wang's whereabouts grew louder on Chinese social media,  authorities began to act. The case was finally registered, and the embassy told the media they had attached great importance to the case.",
      "The next day, Thai and Chinese officials announced that Wang had been rescued.",
      "His first public appearance was alongside Thai police, but he said little, leaving officials to explain what happened.",
      "Details of the rescue itself have been scant. Officials have not even revealed which scam centre he had been in as conflicting versions of the story spread.",
      "One reason could be that withholding more information was part of the deal that led to his release, according to a source who has previously rescued people from scam centres who did not wish to be named.",
      "He told the BBC that these scam centres are keen to avoid attention. That meant releasing Wang was the better option, compared to risking the whole operation because of the attention his disappearance was drawing.",
      "Beijing too wanted to end the discussion about Wang's case. It wants its citizens to believe it has done enough and that scam centres along its border are no longer an issue.",
      "A joint operation by China and ethnic insurgent groups back in 2023 did seek to shut down scam centres in Myanmar's Shan State.",
      "But those on the ground \u2014 NGOs and independent rescuers\u2014tell the BBC the scams are still growing, with construction expanding into even more remote regions.",
      "These days, the area along the border with Thailand is the main centre for international scams in Myanmar, taking advantage of partnerships with the various armed groups competing for power there.",
      "New scam compounds have been built south of the town of Myawaddy, close to the Thai border, where the worst cases of forced labour and other abuses are now being reported.",
      "This has put huge pressure on Thailand, whose economy relies heavily on tourism, especially from China.",
      "Wang's case has had some Chinese wondering about how safe it is to travel to Thailand. \"It feels like after this Wang Xing incident, there will be fewer people going to South East Asia, including Thailand,\" reads a popular Weibo post.",
      "His rescue may well be a success for Thai officials and a win for Beijing, but it has not ended the discussion, or the spotlight on scam compounds.",
      "On Thursday, lines from a recent interview of his were trending on Weibo: \"actor Wang Xing claims he could not eat much food in Myanmar and did not have time to use the toilet\".",
      "His brief disappearance has only exposed how common the danger has become: others in the Chinese film industry have since shared their own accounts of being duped by scammers offering them jobs in Thailand.",
      "Thai police are reported to be now investigating the case of another Chinese model disappeared at Thai-Myanmar border, after he was promised work in Thailand.",
      "The China Federation of Radio and Television Association said in a statement Tuesday that \"many actors\" have gone abroad on fake promises of film shoots, and as a result suffered \"serious damage to their personal and financial security\".",
      "\"We are very concerned about this,\" the statement said.",
      "\"Please save [Wang] from danger and bring to life the story of No More Bets,\" Wang's girlfriend urged in her Weibo post - a reference to the protagonists of the 2023 movie being rescued after they were trafficked into scam centres.",
      "Wang - like those in the film - is among a lucky minority.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of victims from China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore remain stuck in sprawling scam compounds with little hope of rescue.",
      "But ahead of the Lunar New Year, when throngs of Chinese tourists are expected to visit Thailand, the Thai government is eager to emphasise that the country is a safe destination. Thai police also insist that no Thais were involved in Wang's trafficking.",
      "Wang, freshly freed from his ordeal, has no worries about returning to Thailand, a police officer told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "In fact, he added, Wang has promised to come back."

    "summary": "The accused mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks will no longer plead guilty on Friday, after the US government objected.",
    "story": [
      "The accused mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks on the US will no longer plead guilty on Friday, after the US government moved to block plea deals reached last year from going ahead.",
      "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, often referred to as KSM, was due to deliver his pleas at a war court on the Guantanamo Bay naval base in south-eastern Cuba, where he has been held in a military prison for almost two decades.",
      "Mohammed is Guantanamo's most notorious detainee and one of the last held at the base.",
      "But a federal appeals court on Thursday evening halted the scheduled proceedings to consider requests from the government to abandon the plea deals for Mohammed and two co-defendants, which it said would cause \"irreparable\" harm to both it and the public.",
      "A three-judge panel said the delay \"should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits\", but was aimed at giving the court time to receive a full briefing and hear arguments  \"on an expedited basis\".",
      "The delay means that the matter will now fall into the incoming Trump administration.",
      "What was scheduled to happen this week?",
      "At a hearing beginning on Friday morning, Mohammed was scheduled to plead guilty to his role in the 11 September 2001 attacks, when hijackers seized passenger planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon outside of Washington. Another plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back.",
      "Mohammed has been charged with offences including conspiracy and murder, with 2,976 victims listed on the charge sheet.",
      "He has previously said that he planned the \"9/11 operation from A-to-Z\" - conceiving the idea of training pilots to fly commercial planes into buildings and taking those plans to Osama bin Laden, leader of the militant Islamist group al-Qaeda, in the mid 1990s.",
      "Friday's hearing was set to happen in a courtroom on the base, where family members of those killed and the press would have been seated in a viewing gallery behind thick glass.",
      "What happened on 9/11 and who is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?",
      "What happened on 9/11 and who is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?",
      "Why is this all happening 23 years after 9/11?",
      "Pre-trial hearings, held at a military court on the naval base, have been going on for more than a decade, complicated by questions over whether torture Mohammed and other defendants faced while in US custody taints the evidence.",
      "Following his arrest in Pakistan in 2003, Mohammed spent three years at secret CIA prisons known as \"black sites\" where he was subjected to simulated drowning, or \"waterboarding\", 183 times, among other so-called \"advanced interrogation techniques\" that included sleep deprivation and forced nudity.",
      "Karen Greenberg, author of The Least Worst Place: How Guantanamo Became the World's Most Notorious Prison, says the use of torture has made it \"virtually impossible to bring these cases to trial in a way that honors the rule of law and American jurisprudence\".",
      "\"It's apparently impossible to present evidence in these cases without the use of evidence derived from torture. Moreover, the fact that these individuals were tortured adds another level of complexity to the prosecutions,\" she says.",
      "The case also falls under the military commissions, which operate under different rules than the traditional US criminal justice system and slow the process down.",
      "The plea deal was struck last summer, following some two years of negotiations.",
      "What does the plea deal include?",
      "The full details of the deals reached with Mohammed and two of his co-defendants have not been released.",
      "We do know that a deal means he would not face a death penalty trial.",
      "In a court hearing on Wednesday, his legal team confirmed that he had agreed to plead guilty to all charges. Mohammed did not address the court personally, but engaged with his team as they went over the agreement, making small corrections and changes to wording with the prosecution and the judge.",
      "If the deals are upheld and the pleas are accepted by the court, the next steps would be appointing a military jury, known as a panel, to hear evidence at a sentencing hearing.",
      "In court on Wednesday, this was described by lawyers as a form of public trial, where survivors and family members of those killed would be given the opportunity to give statements.",
      "Under the agreement, the families would also be able to pose questions to Mohammed, who would be required to \"answer their questions fully and truthfully\", lawyers say.",
      "Central to the prosecution agreeing to the deals was a guarantee \"that we could present all of the evidence that we thought was necessary to establish a historical record of the accused's involvement in what happened on September 11th,\" prosecutor, Clayton G. Trivett Jr., said in court on Wednesday.",
      "Even if the pleas go ahead, it would be many months before these proceedings would begin and a sentence ultimately delivered.",
      "Why is the US government trying to block the pleas?",
      "US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin appointed the senior official who signed the deal. But he was travelling at the time it was signed and was reportedly caught by surprise, according to the New York Times.",
      "Days later, he attempted to revoke it, saying in a memo: \"Responsibility for such a decision should rest with me as the superior authority.\"",
      "However, both a military judge and a military appeals panel ruled that the deal was valid, and that Mr Austin had acted too late.",
      "In another bid to block the deal, the government this week asked a federal appeals court to intervene.",
      "In a legal filing, it said Mohammed and the two other men were charged with \"perpetrating the most egregious criminal act on American soil in modern history\" and that enforcing the agreements would \"deprive the government and the American people of a public trial as to the respondents' guilt and the possibility of capital punishment, despite the fact that the Secretary of Defense has lawfully withdrawn those agreements\".",
      "Following the announcement of the deal last summer, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, then the party's leader in the chamber, released a statement describing it as \"a revolting abdication of the government's responsibility to defend America and provide justice\".",
      "What have the victims' families said?",
      "Some families of those killed in the attacks have also criticised the deal, saying it is too lenient or lacks transparency.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Today Programme last summer, Terry Strada, whose husband Tom was killed in the attacks, described the deal as \"giving the detainees in Guantanamo Bay what they want\".",
      "Ms Strada, the national chair of the campaign group 9/11 Families United, said: \"This is a victory for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the other two, it's a victory for them.\"",
      "Other families see the agreements as a path towards convictions in the complex and long-running proceedings and were disappointed by the government's latest intervention.",
      "Stephan Gerhardt, whose younger brother Ralph was killed in the attacks, had flown to Guantanamo Bay to watch Mohammed plead guilty.",
      "\"What is the end goal for the Biden administration? So they get the stay and this drags into the next administration. To what end? Think about the families. Why are you prolonging this saga?\" he said.",
      "Mr Gerhardt told the BBC the deals were \"not a victory\" for the families, but that it was \"time to find a way to close this, to convict these men\".",
      "Families on the base were meeting with the press when news of the delay was made public.",
      "\"It was supposed to be a time of healing. We'll board that plane still with that deep sense of pain \u2013 there's just no end to it,\" one said.",
      "Why are the proceedings happening in Guantanamo?",
      "Mohammed has been held in a military prison in Guantanamo Bay since 2006.",
      "The prison was opened 23 years ago - on 11 January 2002 - during the \"war on terror\" that followed the 9/11 attacks, as a place to hold terror suspects and \"illegal enemy combatants\".",
      "Most of those held here were never charged and the military prison has faced criticism from rights groups and the United Nations over its treatment of detainees. The majority have now been repatriated or resettled in other countries.",
      "The prison currently holds 15 - the smallest number at any point in its history. All but six of them have been charged with or convicted of war crimes.",

      "Canada's Conservative Party leader - now 45 - laid out a low-tax, small government vision for the country in an essay contest on what he would do as prime minister.",
      "\"A dollar left in the hands of consumers and investors is more productive than a dollar spent by a politician,\" he stated.",
      "Poilievre is one step closer to making his vision a reality, and even gave a nod to the essay in a recent interview with conservative psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson.",
      "For months, Poilievre's Conservatives have enjoyed a large lead over the struggling Liberals in national surveys, suggesting they would win a majority government if an election were held today.",
      "Now Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he's standing down, and with an election likely to be called soon, Poilievre is promising a return to \"common sense politics\".",
      "For Canadians frustrated with a sluggish economy and a housing and affordability crisis, he is offering an alternative to what he has labelled as Trudeau's \"authoritarian socialism\".",
      "A win would make him part of a wave of populist leaders on the right who have toppled  incumbent governments in the west.",
      "While it has invited comparisons to Donald Trump - and he has fans like Elon Musk and others in the US president-elect's orbit - Poilievre's story is very much a Canadian one.",
      "A Calgarian with his eyes set on Ottawa",
      "Poilievre was born in Canada's western province of Alberta to a 16-year-old mother who put him up for adoption. He was taken in by two school teachers, who raised him in suburban Calgary.",
      "\"I have always believed that it is voluntary generosity among family and community that are the greatest social safety net that we can ever have,\" he told Maclean's Magazine in 2022, reflecting on his early life.",
      "\"That's kind of my starting point.\"",
      "As a teenager, Poilievre showed an early interest in politics, and canvassed for local conservatives.",
      "Poilievre was studying international relations at the University of Calgary when he met Stockwell Day, who served as a cabinet minister under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper.",
      "At the time, Day was seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance - a right-wing party with Alberta roots that became part of the modern-day Conservatives in a 2003 merger - and he tapped Poilievre to help with campus outreach.",
      "\"He impressed me from the start,\" Day told the BBC in an interview. \"He seemed to be a level-headed guy, but full of energy and able to catch people's attention.\"",
      "Day's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.",
      "Poilievre went on to win a seat in Ottawa in 2004 at the age of 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time. He has held that seat since.",
      "From \"Skippy\" to party leader",
      "In Ottawa, Poilievre was given the nickname Skippy by peers and foes alike due to to his youthful enthusiasm and sharp tongue.",

      "Behind the closed doors of Conservative caucus meetings, Poilievre showed his diplomatic side, Day said.",
      "\"Pierre was always good at saying, 'Okay, you know what? I hadn't thought of that,' or he would listen and say: 'Have you thought of this?'\" said Day.",
      "Still, confrontational politics became a cornerstone of Poilievre's public persona. After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, he would target Trudeau with biting remarks as a way to connect with disaffected voters.",
      "It has landed him in trouble at times. In April, he was expelled from the House of Commons for calling the prime minister a \"wacko\".",

      "\"I think when politesse is in conflict with the truth, I choose the truth,\" he said. \"I think we've been too polite for too long with our political class.\"",
      "His combative style has also been divisive, and he has been criticised for oversimplifying complex issues for political gain.",
      "While Canadians have been open to the opposition leader's message as a change from Trudeau's brand of progressive politics, just over half of them hold an unfavourable opinion of him, according to the latest polls.",

      "He has pledged to deliver \"the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history\", promising to keep repeat offenders behind bars.",

      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",

      "\"Inside Edition\" correspondent Alison Hall is opening up about her breast cancer journey and how actress Olivia Munn's own cancer diagnosis influenced Hall's decision to seek testing. Hall shared her story on \"CBS Mornings,\" explaining how Munn's advocacy for early detection, along with a breast cancer risk assessment tool, led to her life-saving diagnosis.",
      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",
      "\"Wow, OK, that feels high,\" Hall said, after hearing the news.",
      "Hall, whose mother had breast cancer at age 50, had already undergone genetic testing for the BRCA gene in her 20s, which came back negative. She also had never had a mammogram until this year, after taking the risk assessment test.",
      "Following the assessment, Hall was placed on a regular screening schedule, including mammograms and MRIs every six months. After an MRI revealed some abnormalities, Hall underwent biopsies, which confirmed she had breast cancer.",
      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",
      "Hall has chosen to undergo a double mastectomy next week to remove the current cancer and lower her risk of future diagnoses.",
      "\"I want to do whatever I can to prevent that for my future self and my future family,\" Hall said.",
      "Munn sent \"CBS Mornings\" a statement to deliver to Hall, saying, \"You are now on the path to survival ... By telling your story, you are creating a ripple effect of hope and saving lives.\"",
      "Hall expressed deep gratitude for Munn's words and emphasized how sharing her story could help others.",
      "\"By Olivia sharing her story, she had a direct impact on my life,\" Hall said.",
      "As Hall prepares for her upcoming surgery, she is grateful for the support of her family and friends, including her husband, whom she calls her \"human support person.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",
      "Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit \"Torn Between Two Lovers\" for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film \"Puff the Magic Dragon.\"",
      "Later songs include the civil rights anthem \"No Easy Walk to Freedom,\" co-written with Margery Tabankin, and \"Light One Candle,\" calling for peace in Lebanon.",
      "Yarrow, who with Travers and Stookey had supported Democratic Sen. Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential bid, met the Minnesota senator's niece, Mary Beth McCarthy, at a campaign event. The couple married the following year. They had two children before divorcing.",
      "In addition to his ex-wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.",

Vieira's husband was vocal about his multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including in one interview with his wife on \"Today\" in 2018, which appeared in the segment.",
      "\"I was diagnosed when I was 25 years old and essentially told there is no hope,\" said Cohen in that 2018 interview. \"Diagnosed and adios. Nothing much we can do.\"",
      "Sharing his health journey and speaking up for others became intertwined with Cohen's work, as his illness was a focal point of his 2004 autobiography, \"Blindsided: Lifting a Life Above Illness: A Reluctant Memoir,\" as well as his later writing. Cohen also survived two bouts of cancer.",

      "What is Multiple Sclerosis?",
      "Multiple sclerosis, often abbreviated M.S., is a chronic autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks itself. It targets the central nervous system and can affect the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, according\u00a0to the the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Symptoms of the illness can vary in type and severity, but, as M.S. disrupts communication between the brain and body, it can cause problems like fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, mobility issues and impaired vision. Cohen was legally blind.",
      "What causes M.S. is unknown, and why the disease manifests in some people and not others isn't clear. According to the Mayo Clinic, it's thought that genetics and environmental factors may increase an individual's risk of developing the illness.",
      "It is incurable, but there are treatments. The disease is rarely fatal, and most people diagnosed with it have a normal life expectancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",

      "Oprah Winfrey selected Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\" as her latest book club choice. The book encourages readers to find peace and purpose and makes history as the first book to be chosen twice. Read a free excerpt below.",
      "Chapter One",
      "The Flowering of Human Consciousness",
      "EVOCATION Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower probably did not survive for long, and \ufb02owers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread \ufb02owering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet\u2014if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.",
      "Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call \ufb02owers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, \ufb02owers were most likely the \ufb01rst thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the \ufb02owers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a \"silent sermon\" once during which he held up a \ufb02ower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.",
      "Seeing beauty in a \ufb02ower could awaken humans, however brie\ufb02y, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The \ufb01rst recognition of beauty was one of the most signi\ufb01cant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, \ufb02owers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more \ufb02eeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word \"enlightenment\" in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon \ufb02owers as the enlightenment of plants.",
      "Any life-form in any realm\u2014mineral, vegetable, animal, or human\u2014can be said to undergo \"enlightenment.\" It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.",
      "What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.",
      "Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didn't become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.",
      "Since time immemorial, \ufb02owers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special signi\ufb01cance for the human spirit. Like all life forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special signi\ufb01cance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and af\ufb01nity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.",
      "Once there is a certain degree of Presence, of still and alert attention in human beings' perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.",
      "In the case of a \ufb02ower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more there than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an af\ufb01nity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form ob- obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life forms. The exception to this are all newborn life forms\u2014babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet \ufb01rmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.",
      "So when you are alert and contemplate a \ufb02ower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three \"en-lightened\" life forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus \ufb02ower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signi\ufb01es the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.",
      "THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK",
      "Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner \ufb02owering so radical and profound that compared to it the \ufb02owering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale re\ufb02ection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of material-ism and materiality and rise above identi\ufb01cation with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to im- imprisonment within their own personality?",
      "The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers\u2014Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known\u2014were humanity's early \ufb02owers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread \ufb02owering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.",
      "Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",
      "\"You're a mixologist as well?\"",
      "\"Oh, I can hook it up.\"",

    "title": "Many Americans are leaving U.S. states with abortion bans, study finds",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 10:12:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for the first time setting guidelines for levels of lead in processed baby foods such as jarred fruits and vegetables.",
      "Part of an effort to reduce exposure to a toxic metal that causes developmental and neurological issues in children, the action announced on Monday offers only voluntary \u2014 not mandatory \u2014 limits for food manufacturers. But the agency can take enforcement action if it finds foods that surpass its recommended limits.",
      "The FDA guidance caps lead levels for children younger than 2 at 10 parts per billion for fruits, most vegetables, grain and meat mixtures, yogurts, custards and puddings, and single-ingredient meats. It sets a limit of 20 parts per billion for single-ingredient root vegetables and for dry infant cereals.",
      "The directive covers packaged processed foods sold in jars, pouches, tubs or boxes. By contrast, the new limits don't cover grain-based snacks like puffs and teething biscuits, despite some research indicating the products have higher levels of lead. It also doesn't limit other metals like cadmium that have been found in baby foods.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

    "summary": "About 1,600 policies for Pacific Palisades homeowners were dropped by State Farm in July, the state insurance office says.",
    "story": [
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been devastated by the Palisades Fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in an Thursday email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis of insurance data by CBS San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, State Farm said, \"Our No. 1 priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "State Farm's decision reflects a trend of private insurers, including\u00a0Allstate\u00a0and Farmers Insurance, of dropping California policies or halting underwriting, leaving homeowners with the choice of getting coverage through the insurer of last resort, the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or FAIR Plan, or forgo insurance altogether. The FAIR Plan provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not.",
      "As a result, homeowners in Pacific Palisades had increasingly shifted to the FAIR Plan, with roughly 1,400 of the town's 9,000 homes covered by the plan in 2024, more than quadruple the number in 2020, according to data from the insurer. In other words, prior to the disaster, about 1 in 7 homeowners were reliant on the FAIR Plan.",
      "The Palisades Fire could become the costliest wildfire in history because of the number of buildings that have been destroyed and as the structures rank among the nation's most expensive homes, said Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist, on a Wednesday webcast about the disaster. The neighborhood's 9,000 residential units have a median home value of $3.1 million,\u00a0according to real estate data firm ATTOM Data.",
      "While personally and financially devastating to homeowners, the Los Angeles fires \u2014 which include the Eaton Fire and several other wildfires \u2014 are likely to place added stress on the state's already fragile insurance market, experts and lawmakers say. It's an issue that extends beyond California, with similar issues facing homeowners in Florida, Louisiana and other states.",
      "\"We will be watching to see whether the collapse of a trembling home insurance market accelerates after this added shock,\" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, wrote on X Thursday. Whitehouse serves on the Senate Budget Committee, which last month issued a report\u00a0about climate change's impact on the insurance market.",
      "With the fires continuing to rage across the Los Angeles area, the estimated cost of the disaster is surging. The potential property damage and economic losses could amount to as much as $150 billion, according to a Thursday estimate from AccuWeather. That would make these wildfires by far the most destructive in U.S. history.",
      "In California, State Farm last year said it was discontinuing coverage for 72,000 houses and apartments in the state. Since 2019, more than 100,000 Californians have lost their insurance, according to a San Francisco Chronicle\u00a0analysis of insurance data.",
      "\"A full-scale financial crisis\"",
      "With climate disasters increasing in frequency, the insurance industry is grappling with a new calculus amid rising costs and risks. That's prompting some insurers to decide not to renew insurance policies in counties that are most at risk from climate risks \u2014 and it's not only within California and the other usual suspects, the Senate report found.",
      "\"The data confirm that it is climate change that is driving increasing non-renewal rates,\" it noted. \"Second, the data reveal that Florida, Louisiana, California, and Texas are not the only places experiencing spiking non-renewal rates and increasing premiums.\"",
      "Other regions facing rising non-renewal rates are Southern New England, the Carolinas, New Mexico and counties in the Northern Rockies, Oklahoma, and Hawaii, the report found.",
      "The issue isn't just local. \"This is predicted to cascade into plunging property values in communities where insurance becomes impossible to find or prohibitively expensive \u2014 a collapse in property values with the potential to trigger a full-scale financial crisis similar to what occurred in 2008,\" the report stressed.",
      "\"Here's how it works: Climate change makes risk unpredictable; risk makes insurance unaffordable or unavailable; no insurance makes mortgages unavailable; without mortgages property values crash; cascading like 2008 into general economy,\" Whitehouse wrote Thursday on X.",
      "FAIR Plan",
      "Still, there's some potential for near-term relief. Homeowners in California could get help from a new state regulation, announced Monday, that will require insurers to offer coverage in wildfire-prone areas.",
      "The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the FAIR Plan, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said. The average cost of insurance on the FAIR Plan is about $3,200, or more than double the typical homeowner's cost in California, according to Bankrate.",
      "The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, they'd need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said.",
      "In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office.",
      "Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Lara said in a statement.",

When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the jobless rate stood at 6.4%, while inflation was about to soar to 40-year highs, kicking off a flurry of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to tame price increases.",
      "Under the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, the economy has cooled, dampening inflation but also creating some cracks in the labor market. At the same time, the incoming Trump administration's policies, if enacted, are expected to be inflationary, prompting some economists to predict that the central bank may hold off on cutting rates at its January 29 meeting.",
      "Fewer Fed cuts?",
      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",
      "The Fed in December trimmed its benchmark for a third straight month amid signs that the economy was gearing down. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections.",
      "Some economists think the Fed could lower borrowing costs one once in 2025, while others expect more cuts.",
      "\"Our own baseline continues to assume three rate cuts this year, one more than signaled by the Fed, with the first to come in March,\"Vanden Houten said. \"The December report increases the risk that the Fed will remain on hold in March and that we only see two cuts this year, particularly if policies on tariffs and immigration implemented by the incoming Trump administration are more inflationary than currently incorporated in our baseline.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "title": "Many Americans are leaving U.S. states with abortion bans, study finds",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 05:00:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

For those looking to be treated fairly and paid for damage and destruction to their property, speaking up and doing advance research is crucial, experts and consumer advocates say.",

      "Triple-I advises the following\u00a0steps to begin filing a claim:",
      "Contact your insurance carrier or agent as soon as possible to begin the claim-filing process, and make sure to ask about requirements and deadlines. Many insurers have a mobile app where you can file a claim.",
      "Take photos of damaged items (if it is safe to do so) and don't discard damaged items until your assigned insurance adjuster has completed their assessment.",
      "Keep all receipts for out-of-pocket expenses, such as temporary lodging.",

      "Many property owners hit with large and total losses learn the hard way that they are not fully insured. The issue is so common that United Policyholders has an entire section on its website devoted to underinsurance help. \"Many property owners have succeeded in getting the coverage they thought they had but didn't, but many have given up. Insurers count on you giving up,\" according to the nonprofit organization that advocates for policyholders of all types.",
      "Fires that damage but don't completely destroy one's home create their own insurance claim issues, according to United Policyholders. Things to watch out for include hidden damage from water, smoke, ash and mold. Air quality and ducts should also be considered. \"Repairs should return your property to a 'uniform and consistent appearance' even if that means replacing undamaged items such as roof tiles or carpeting,\" it stated.",
      "People living in seemingly unscathed residences alongside homes that burned down should still have their place inspected for possible structural and other damage from extreme heat, smoke or fire retardant. \"If your insurer refuses to conduct or pay for proper inspections, ask again in writing; politely remind them of their legal duty to thoroughly investigate all damage, including hidden damage. If a dispute arises, it's worth finding and paying for your own inspection by an independent reputable specialist,\" United Policyholders said.",
      "Smoke damage is a covered peril in most policies, with disputes often arising over cleaning or replacing exposed items.",
      "Extreme heat and smoke kills most plants and may contaminate soil. Keep your claim open for at least six months and file supplemental claims if necessary, as damaged plants may not die right away. Coverage for landscaping replacement is typically a set amount or percentage of your dwelling coverage. The losses are frequently only partially covered. \"Mature trees can be valued as high as $5,000 yet many policies contact a $500 per tree limit.\"",
      "Another thing to keep in mind: Unreimbursed losses can offset your tax obligations when you claim as a casualty loss deduction.",
      "If one believes they are being treated poorly by their insurance company, the California Department of Insurance has an online\u00a0form that homeowners can use to file complaints.",
      "Steps in preparing to evacuate",
      "For those told to evacuate due to the wildfires, do so immediately. For those preparing to evacuate, here are some tips from United Policyholders:",
      "1. Document your home and possessions. Take pictures or a video of each room and the outside of your house. Build as much of an inventory as time permits including furnishings, artwork, jewelry and appliances. \"After a traumatic loss, it's impossible to remember everything you had, so most people never collect their full insurance benefits,\" United Policyholders noted.",

      "While serving as a representative, Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer,\u00a0co-sponsored legislation\u00a0that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code. After leaving office, he served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, the Employee Retention Tax Credit, or ERTC.",
      "In her Jan. 9 letter to Long, Warren raises questions about Long's tax expertise as well as his promotion of the ERTC, which has been\u00a0flagged\u00a0by the IRS for its high rate of fraud. Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",

      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",

      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines.

      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

      "Problems highlighted in the report echo issues that bedeviled millions of taxpayers during the pandemic, when the IRS shuttered its offices, causing many returns to get caught in a bottleneck, delaying refunds. While the worst of those issues have since been resolved, Collins noted, the IRS continues to struggle in some areas, such as processing paper returns and dealing with taxpayers who have been victims of identity theft, which can lead to lengthy refund delays.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the improvements I have described, taxpayers continue to face challenges in their dealings with the IRS,\" she wrote.",
      "The nearly $80 billion in funding from the IRA has helped the tax agency hire more workers, some of whom have bulked up its customer service support. But almost $6 out of every $10 of the new funding is directed toward enforcement, or boosting audits of wealthy tax cheats and businesses that skirt tax laws, the report noted.",
      "\"I have previously criticized this extreme imbalance in funding priorities,\" Collins wrote in the report, noting that she believes more money should be directed toward taxpayer services, an IRS unit that helps taxpayers with questions, problems and other dilemmas that arise.",
      "The IRS has already made improvements in some of the areas underscored by Collins, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTA report also acknowledges the progress the IRS has made, which Werfel said demonstrates \"what a well-funded IRS can do.\"",
      "\"It's important to continue that momentum because we recognize the agency's work isn't done \u2014not by a long shot,\" he said. \"It's vital that the IRS continue this progress to better serve taxpayers and the nation.\"",
      "Here's who is facing tax refund delays",
      "Collins reiterated one of her earlier\u00a0criticisms\u00a0of the IRS: That paper returns are the agency's \"kryptonite.\" Unfortunately, she said in her most recent return, the IRS continues to receive more than 10 million income tax returns on paper each year \u2014 while it also gets another 75 million paper forms from taxpayers.",
      "While the IRS has made progress in processing paper returns, it's still not up to snuff, she noted. Processing paper returns can still take months for the IRS to complete, she added.",
      "And many people who e-file also face delays if their 1040s are rejected, an issue that impacted 18 million taxpayers in fiscal year 2024, or 12% percent of returns, her report noted. These rejections can happen for issues like a PIN that doesn't match the prior year's return, or an adjusted gross income number that doesn't match up from the prior year.",
      "\"[M]ost rejected returns are valid, requiring taxpayers to jump through additional hoops to resubmit their returns electronically or submit the returns on paper,\" she wrote. \"Most taxpayers receive refunds, and delays in processing both paper-filed and e-filed returns translate into refund delays.\"",
      "People who have been victims of identity theft are another group that often face delays in getting resolution. About half a million taxpayers are still trying to their their issues fixed, although it took the IRS about 22 months on average to resolve the cases and send refunds to the victims, she added.",
      "That can be stressful for taxpayers waiting for their refunds, but it also creates an additional cost to the federal government, which must pay interest on overpayments it doesn't refund on a timely basis, the report pointed out.",
      "Some businesses, meanwhile, are facing delays due to the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit created in the pandemic to help businesses stay afloat. But the IRS has\u00a0flagged the ERC as vulnerable to fraud, leading to delays in processing returns.",
      "The IRS is \"still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024\" for returns that claimed the Employee Retention Credit, the report said. \"Although its aim was to minimize the payment of ineligible claims, there have been lengthy delays in the payment of eligible claims submitted by employers that, in some cases, are depending on ERC refunds to remain in business.\"",
      "When does tax filing open in 2025?",
      "Tax filing typically begins at the end of January, although the IRS hasn't yet announced when it will start accepting all returns.",
      "Some taxpayers can start filing on Jan. 10, however, the IRS said on Tuesday. That's because its Free File service will start accepting returns on Friday, it noted.",
      "The IRS Free File program, which is offered through tax software companies, is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.",
      "It's a different service than the IRS' relatively new Direct File service, which will be available in more than 20 states this tax season, from Alaska to Wyoming.",

      "\"In our experience and that of others, Community Notes on X are often slow to appear, sometimes downright inaccurate and unlikely to appear on controversial posts because of an inability to reach agreement or consensus among users,\" Maarten Schenk, co-founder and chief operating officer at Lead Stories, said in a post Tuesday on the fact-checking site. \"Ultimately, the truth doesn't care about consensus or agreement: the shape of the Earth stays the same even if social media users can't agree on it.\"",

And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",

      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

    "story": [
      "Appearing in court virtually from his Mar-a-Lago home Friday, President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced for his crimes in the\u00a0New York \"hush money\" case\u00a0and released with no restrictions.",
      "Justice Juan\u00a0Merchan\u00a0followed through on a promise made one week ago to give Trump a sentence of unconditional discharge, which includes neither jail time nor any other restriction that might impede Trump after his inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "Merchan said during sentencing Friday that he was granting that sentence because he believed it was the only legal option, just 10 days before Trump assumes the presidency.",
      "Merchan told the court that \"this has been a truly extraordinary case,\" even though once the courtroom doors closed, the trial itself had been in his estimation no more special or unique than any other.",
      "However, he told Trump, the same could not be said about the circumstances surrounding the president-elect's sentencing \"because of the office you once occupied and will soon occupy again.\" Merchan said that it was the legal protections afforded to the office of the president that were extraordinary, \"not the occupant of the office.\"",
      "Those legal protections were a factor that overrode all others, Merchan said, but they were not a mitigating factor. He said they did not reduce the seriousness of the crimes or erase the jury's verdict.",
      "Merchan said he determined that the only lawful sentence he could give, without encroaching on the highest post in the land, was an unconditional discharge.",
      "Donald Trump, the civilian, he said, might not have gotten so lenient a sentence.",

      "Trump was given the opportunity to address the court. He called the trial \"a very terrible experience\" and \"a tremendous setback for New York.\"",
      "\"With all the horrible things that are going on, I got indicted for calling a legal expense a legal expense,\" Trump said, referring to the falsified reimbursements to a former lawyer, for a \"hush money\" payment at the core of the case.",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said on camera. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "\"The fact is I'm totally innocent,\" Trump said. \"I did nothing wrong.\"",
      "Ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said Trump's actions in attacking the judicial system and prosecutors in this case \"constitutes a direct attack on the rule of law itself.\"",
      "\"Far from expressing any kind of remorse for his criminal conduct, the defendant has purposefully bred disdain for our judicial institutions and the rule of law, and he's done this to serve his own ends, and to encourage others to reject the jury verdict that he finds so distasteful,\" Steinglass said.",
      "\"Put simply, this defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system, and has placed officers of the court in harm's way,\" Steinglass said. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was in attendance, in the gallery, but did not address the court.",
      "Blanche said that he strongly disagreed with Steinglass' assessment of the case and Trump's conduct. He claimed it was not just Trump and experts cited by Trump who felt the case should not have been brought, but the majority of the American people, referring to those who voted for the Republican in November.",
      "At every turn, Trump and his lawyers have fought Manhattan prosecutors since the beginning of the \"hush money\" investigation in 2018. They challenged prosecutors' subpoenas and rulings by Merchan, battling all the way to the Supreme Court multiple times, including an effort this week to stave off Friday's hearing.",
      "On Thursday, the Supreme Court said it would not intervene on Trump's behalf, clearing the way for Merchan to issue his decision. Trump, soon after the high court's decision, said he had read it and \"thought it was a fair decision, actually,\" noting the Supreme Court justices pointed out he could appeal and that there would be \"really\u2026no penalty.\"",
      "\"But we're going to appeal anyway,\" he added in his remarks Thursday night.",
      "\"So, I'll do my little thing tomorrow. They can have fun with their political opponent,\" Trump said.",
      "Although there are no cameras in the courtroom, an audio recording of the proceedings will be released after the hearing concludes.",
      "While Trump's trial and arraignment brought crowds and overnight lines, on Friday morning, the general public line was sparse and no onlookers in the park across the street were visible before dawn.",
      "Trump was found guilty in May after a seven-week trial. A unanimous jury concluded he committed 34 felonies in authorizing a scheme in 2017 to falsify records, in order to cover up reimbursements for a \"hush money\" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels.",
      "Daniels testified during the trial, as did Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen, who received the falsified reimbursements for his wire to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen gave Daniels the $130,000 payment in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.",
      "Multiple witnesses testified that Trump was pleased voters did not learn of Daniels' story before the 2016 election.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration on Friday announced it would extend the temporary legal status of nearly 1 million immigrants from El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela, utilizing a program that is expected to be curtailed by the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The announcement will allow Salvadoran, Sudanese, Ukrainian and Venezuelan immigrants who currently have Temporary Protected Status to renew their work permits and deportation protections under the policy, which offers a legal reprieve to foreigners from countries beset by war, natural disasters or other emergencies that make deportations unsafe.",
      "The decision is set to benefit roughly 234,000 Salvadorans; 1,900 Sudanese; 104,000 Ukrainians; and 600,000 Venezuelans, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the programs. The TPS program for El Salvador will be extended through March 2026, while the designations for Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela will be extended through October 2026.",
      "Friday's move is notable since TPS is expected to be scaled back by the President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to dismantle Biden administration immigration policy, enact tougher immigration rules and launch a mass deportation campaign. TPS designations can be revoked by the DHS secretary, as long as the government provides a 60-day notice.",
      "Trump and incoming Vice President JD Vance have both signaled their opposition to TPS, which Republican lawmakers and immigration hawks have long argued has been improperly extended, despite its temporary nature. During Trump's first administration, the government tried to end TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, though its efforts were stalled by legal challenges.",
      "While it announced the TPS extensions, the Biden administration on Friday declined to make new arrivals eligible for the temporary status, despite calls from progressive activists who say the move would make it harder for Trump to carry out his promised mass deportations. Redesignating the TPS program for Venezuela, for example, would make hundreds of thousands of additional migrants eligible for the initiative.",
      "The Biden administration has also faced pressure from advocates to allow hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants to apply for TPS ahead of Trump's inauguration. But officials are leaning against it, two people familiar with internal deliberations told CBS News, in part due to concerns about the move appearing like a politically motivated effort to hinder the incoming administration.",
      "Friday's move affects a diverse population of immigrants, with different legal circumstances.",
      "Salvadorans with TPS have generally been in the U.S. for over two decades, since 2001, when immigrants from El Salvador were first granted the temporary status following devastating earthquakes in the small Central American country.",
      "Most of the Venezuelans enrolled in the TPS program crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally or entered the country under Biden administration programs designed to reduce illegal immigration over the past four years. They have arrived in the U.S. as part of a larger exodus from Venezuela that has seen 8 million people flee economic calamity and government repression in the South American nation.",
      "Ukrainian TPS holders, by and large, were either processed at the California-Mexico border in early 2022 soon after Russia invaded their homeland or flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration initiative that has allowed private citizens to sponsor Ukrainian refugees.",

They're not fine with a foreign adversary, as they've determined it is, gathering all this information about the 170 million people who use TikTok,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said.",
      "Several of the justices raised concerns about TikTok's collection of Americans' data, and the prospect of China having access to that personal information.

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump received a sentence of unconditional discharge in a New York court for his conviction in the \"hush money\" case.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to be released with no restrictions Friday after his criminal conviction in the\u00a0\"hush money\" case in New York.",
      "Though he'll receive no punishment under the unconditional discharge sentence, Trump and his attorney pledged to appeal his conviction as he prepares to take office in 10 days as the 47th president of the United States. Speaking virtually from his residence in Florida, Trump continued to insist during the hearing that he's \"totally innocent.\"",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said on camera. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "Prosecutors had also recommended a sentence of unconditional discharge, given Trump's impending inauguration, but not before blasting Trump's behavior and the precedent it sets.",
      "\"Put simply, this defendant has caused enduring damage to public perception of the criminal justice system, and has placed officers of the court in harm's way,\" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.",
      "Listen to the Trump sentencing hearing audio",
      "Although cameras were not allowed in the courtroom to provide video of the hearing, after its conclusion the court released the audio, which can be heard in the player above.",
      "What was Trump sentenced for?",
      "The case stemmed from a\u00a0$130,000 \"hush money\" payment\u00a0Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election. Prosecutors claimed the payment was made to keep voters unaware of Daniels' allegation that she had sex with Trump years earlier, a claim Trump still denies.",
      "Trump was charged with 34 counts of falsification of business records in the first degree, a felony in New York, and a jury convicted him on all 34 counts.",
      "What is an unconditional discharge?",
      "An unconditional discharge, the sentence Merchan imposed on Trump, allows release without any formal punishment or ability to impose punishment at a further date.",
      "That means no prison time, no community service volunteer time and no fines for his conviction. The maximum sentence, which a first offender would have been unlikely to receive, was four years in prison and several thousand dollars in fines for each of the 34 counts.",
      "\"This court has determined that the only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgment of conviction without encroaching on the highest office in the land, is an unconditional discharge,\" Merchan told Trump, wishing him \"Godspeed\" on his second term.",
      "The sentence is a highly unusual one, which Merchan suggested he had imposed because of legal protections afforded to the office of the president of the United States.",

      "At a court hearing in April, prosecutors argued Vo had already demonstrated a pattern of defiance against the court system. Vo was accused of violating his pretrial release conditions by attending a protest outside of the Washington, D.C., jail in support of Jan. 6 rioters. The judge placed a curfew on Vo during his case, due to violations of court orders, according to the Justice Department's filings.",
      "In a court filing, prosecutors said, \"Vo's complete lack of remorse for his actions on January 6 should also animate the Court's decision regarding his sentence. Within minutes of leaving the Capitol building on January 6, Vo used text messages and social media to brag about intimidating\u00a0police officers, halting the vote count, and storming the building. His lack of contrition continued after his trial when he repeatedly used social media to dispute his guilt, where he called himself a 'J6 wrongful convict.'\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

      "A jury in 2023 awarded Ruby Freeman and daughter Shaye Moss $148 million to be paid by Giuliani for falsely claiming the pair engaged in a fake ballot processing scheme in Fulton County, Georgia, during the 2020 presidential election. The federal judge overseeing the case, Beryl Howell, determined Giuliani was liable for defaming Freeman and Moss after they became focal points of his unfounded claims.",
      "Since the trial, Giuliani has appeared in several separate court proceedings about his ability to pay the fine.",
      "On Monday, a federal judge in Manhattan held him in contempt for failing to turn over information about his assets to contribute to paying off the $148 million he owes. Court papers say he has handed over some possessions, including a car, but the court said he failed to give them access to his other assets and information. The litigation over his finances continues.",
      "Ahead of Friday's hearing in Washington, D.C., Giuliani asked to appear virtually, citing health problems and safety concerns. He ultimately withdrew that request after the judge appeared skeptical of his claims.",
      "Late last year, the women alleged Giuliani continued to defame them, in violation of a court order. They claimed he had said on two broadcast shows that video showed them \"quadruple counting\" ballots and passing hard drives meant to \"fix\" voting machines.",
      "According to court papers, Giuliani said in a Nov. 12, 2024 broadcast, \"I'm sorry they're going to sue me again for saying it, but what am I going to do but tell the truth?\"",
      "\"These statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,\" attorneys for the women wrote in court papers.",
      "Giuliani and his defense team pushed back on the latest claims, alleging Freeman and Moss failed to \"present clear and convincing evidence of a violation,\" adding they did not consider \"Giuliani's substantial compliance with the consent judgment since its entry.\"",

    "summary": "Special counsel Jack Smith submitted his final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Atlanta on Thursday rejected a bid to block the release of a portion of\u00a0special counsel Jack Smith's final report detailing his investigation and prosecution of President-elect Donald Trump stemming from an alleged plan to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denied the request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, who were charged for their role in allegedly obstructing a separate federal investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records.",
      "The 11th Circuit granted Smith's request to drop Trump from the case in late November after he was elected to a second term in the White House because of a Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But federal prosecutors are moving forward with the appeal of a lower court decision dismissing the charges against Nauta and de Oliveira on the grounds Smith was unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "Smith submitted a two-volume final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday evening that detailed his investigations into Trump. The first volume relates to the prosecution stemming from the 2020 election, and the second volume pertains to the president-elect's alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office in 2020.",
      "Garland has pledged to disclose to the public all special counsel reports completed while he was attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into President Biden's handling of documents marked classified.",
      "But lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira earlier this week sought to stop Smith's report from being made public, arguing it would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Defense attorneys simultaneously asked the 11th Circuit and U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw the documents case, to block the Justice Department from releasing the report.",
      "Cannon on Tuesday agreed to temporarily block the report's release until the 11th Circuit resolves the matter, leaving it to the appeals court to decide whether Smith's work should be made public. Her order remains in effect for another three days, though the appeals court said if the Justice Department would like to seek relief, it could file a notice of appeal.",
      "On Thursday night, the Justice Department filed its appeal of Cannon's injunction. That appeal now also goes to the 11th Circuit.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment, as did lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira. Steven Cheung, a spokesperson for Trump, said in a statement that \"It is time for Joe Biden and Merrick Garland to do the right thing and put a final stop to the political weaponization of our Justice system.\"",
      "In filings with the 11th Circuit, the Justice Department asked the court to deny Nauta and de Oliveira's bid to keep the report shielded from the public, but said Garland would not release the portion that deals with the classified documents case while proceedings involving the two co-defendants are ongoing.",
      "Separately, the president-elect's lawyers\u00a0urged Garland\u00a0in a letter to remove Smith from his post as special counsel and stop the preparation and dissemination of his report.",
      "Prosecutors said the attorney general does plan to disclose to Congress and the American people the first volume of Smith's report involving the 2020 election case. They said he would make a redacted version of the second volume about the documents case available for review only by the top lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information from it.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Garland on Wednesday informed the top Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committees that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. The attorney general reiterated his intent to make public the first volume \"in furtherance of the public interest in informing a co-equal branch and the public regarding this significant matter,\" but would not release the second volume \"to avoid any risk of prejudice\" to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "In their own filing with the 11th Circuit, defense lawyers urged the court to send the dispute back to Cannon's court for a hearing and, in the meantime, prevent Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report.",
      "\"A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial,\" they wrote.",
      "Though Trump is not a party before the 11th Circuit, his lawyers submitted a friend-of-the-court brief urging the court to block the release of Smith's report.",
      "The report, they claimed, is \"nothing less than another attempted political hit job which sole purpose is to disrupt the Presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power.\"",

The president also said he'll be asking Congress for more funding to help.",

      "According to the motion, the plea agreements reached over the summer, which are still under seal, would have the three defendants plead guilty to the seven charges against them for their alleged roles in the terrorist attacks, in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty. The charges include murder, conspiracy and terrorism, as well as an eighth charge of intentionally causing serious bodily injury.",

      "Soon after the plea agreements were reached,\u00a0Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin\u00a0tried to revoke them, arguing in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the power to approve the plea deals, rather than the subordinate authority who accepted the deals.",

Austin has since reiterated that he still feels he should be the person who makes the decision on the 9/11 plea deals. On Thursday, during a trip to Germany, Austin was asked again about his decision to revoke the deals.",

      "New York Justice Juan Merchan rejected Trump's latest motions to dismiss the case, and set aside his conviction, which argued a president-elect is entitled to the same protections from criminal proceedings as a president. Trump, who railed against the case for years, also said evidence shown at trial that related to his first presidency violated that same constitutional immunity.",
      "New York prosecutors objected to any further delay of the sentencing hearing, which has now been scheduled four times since Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.",

      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

      "In a 84 to 9 vote, the Senate voted to advance the legislation, with 31 Democrats joining all voting Republicans to clear a 60-vote threshold to begin debate. The bill marks the first policy legislation of the new Congress, and the House approved it in a bipartisan vote of its own on Tuesday.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune will now decide which, if any, amendments will be considered on the floor. Some Democrats who voted to proceed said they did so in order to offer changes to the legislation before deciding how they would vote on final passage.",
      "The bill is named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",
      "Under current law, the Department of Homeland Security is mandated to detain noncitizens convicted of certain crimes, including \"aggravated felonies,\" or serious offenses like murder and sexual assault. The Laken Riley Act would expand mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes.",
      "Whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding is an open question. The agency is currently using roughly 39,000 of 41,000 detention beds funded by Congress.",

This week, 48 House Democrats joined all voting Republicans to approve the measure \u2014 up from 37 who did so last year \u2014 despite pushback from some Democrats who have argued that the bill is merely political posturing.",

      "Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has accepted an invitation from President-elect Donald Trump to meet with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans.",
      "\"That is the plan. Yes, we are going to have a conversation,\" Fetterman told CBS News about the upcoming meeting.",
      "The trip will mark the first known time a sitting Democratic U.S. senator is meeting with Trump at his Palm Beach residence since the election.",
      "\"I think that one, he's the president, or he will be officially,\" Fetterman said. \"And I think it's pretty reasonable that if the president would like to have a conversation \u2014 or invite someone to have a conversation \u2014 to have it. And no one is my gatekeeper.\"",
      "Trump met with the Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C., Muriel Bowser, last month to talk about the inauguration and his second term, her office said in a statement.",

      "Fetterman was the first Democrat to sponsor the Laken Riley Act, which would compel the federal government to detain noncitizens convicted or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting. A version of the legislation passed the House and is now before the Senate for consideration.",

      "Trump also hopes Fetterman will support some of his nominees, including Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, a source said.",
      "Trump won Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes in November, after losing the state to President Biden in 2020. Fetterman won his seat in 2022 and is up for reelection in 2028, when his home state is likely to be a presidential battleground yet again.",
      "Trump campaigned against Fetterman in 2022, at one point falsely claiming that the then-lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania used illegal drugs including cocaine, heroin and fentanyl.",
      "\"I've been very clear that I have ongoing conversations with people that are going to have an impact on Pennsylvania and for the nation,\" Fetterman said. \"And I am a senator for Pennsylvania, not just for Democrats. I am a senator for everyone in Pennsylvania.\"",
      "Fetterman has proven to be open to some proposals Trump has floated, even though most Democrats have immediately dismissed them. When the president-elect proposed this week that the U.S. should control Greenland, Fetterman indicated it was an idea worth talking about.",
      "\"I have no idea what's going to exactly come up. So, I mean, regardless of whatever comes up, that's going to be part of the conversation,\" Fetterman told CBS News.",
      "Trump aides have also talked about meeting with some other Democratic members of Congress about the State and Local tax \u2014 or SALT \u2014 the tax deduction that allows taxpayers to deduct all or part of their state or local tax but is capped for individual taxpayers at $10,000.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Former president Jimmy Carter's vice president, Walter Mondale,\u00a0died in 2021\u00a0but left behind a eulogy that his son Ted read at Carter's memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington Thursday morning.",
      "The eulogy \u2014 which Walter Mondale was believed to have written in 2015 after Carter, who was 90 years old at the time, announced he had brain cancer \u2014 touched on how some issues Carter and his Vice President faced were ahead of their time.",
      "\"The most was climate change. Yeah, I mean Carter staked his presidency on environmental regulation, on deregulation of industries, on conservation,\" Ted Mondale said.",
      "The eulogy also alluded to the relationship Carter and Walter Mondale shared post-presidency. Walter Mondale wrote that, \"unlike a lot of vice presidents and their presidents, our relationship did not blow up.\"",
      "Read the full transcript of Walter Mondale's eulogy below:",
      "\"Today we join in sadness to honor our dear friend, President Carter, for his extraordinary years of principled and decent leadership, his courageous commitment to civil rights and human rights. I think we all remember that day when then-Governor Carter made his famous inaugural address and for the first time a Georgia Governor called for a commitment to the traditions of Martin Luther King and for the decency that his leadership stood for over Dr. King's lifetime.",
      "\"I was surprised when then-candidate Gov. Carter asked me to join him as his running mate in 1976. He amazed me then as he has every year since and following his presidency. He, of course, was brilliant, as we all know. He had a great sense of humor. While we had only 4 years in the White House, he achieved so much in that time. It stood as a marker for Americans dedicated to justice and decency. Today we come to say goodbye to our friend and to deeply thank his partner, Rosalynn, who is with us today. God bless you Rosalynn.",
      "\"Carter was a man of his word. I remember when we talked about his concept of the vice presidency. I told him that I would like to do it and I had only two requests. I wanted to make a real contribution and didn't want to be embarrassed or humiliated as many of my predecessors had been in that office. He agreed, welcomed my full participation, directed his staff to treat me as they would him and, during our 4 years in the White House, he was very careful to protect me from the frustration and too often humiliation that had cursed the lives of many vice presidents. These were good years for Joan and me. Because of that, I want to thank the President for the good choices he made of his key personnel, key advisors and political leaders. We don't have time to mention many of them but Stu Eizenstat comes as close as humanly possible to rivaling President Carter's formidable work ethic. Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell were blessings every day during my time in the White House.",
      "\"One of the things that dawned on me during the course of our time together in the White House is how well we seemed to work together and how we seemed to understand each other and how, unlike a lot of vice presidents and their presidents, our relationship did not blow up. I think one ofthe realities was that Carter was a devout Christian who grew up, as we know, in a small town and was active in his faith for almost every moment of his life. I was also a small-town kid and I grew up in our small Methodist church where my Dad was the preacher and our faith was very basic to me as Carter's faith was to him. That created a bond between us that allowed us to understand each other and to find ways to work together because ofour common commitment to our faith.",
      "\"Joan loved her time as the second lady and we have Jimmy and Rosalynn to thank for helping her champion the public arts while we were together and for being so kind to her. With his leadership, we created the model vice presidency, a real partnership between the President and the Vice President. Working together, we did change how my office acted to provide new levels of support to his presidency. We became very close friends. We often spent hours together throughout the day. We were working on real problems, not wasting time. That model vice presidency that Carter helped create has been followed in one way or another by later administrations of both parties. Our personal relationship we established while we were in office continued throughout our lives. He allowed me to take a leadership role on issues that never would have been allowed before. I worked in a central role in trying to bring decency to the Vietnamese and Southeast Asian boat people who were fleeing their countries. With President Carter's orders, the boat people were picked up by our great Navy from their flimsy boats which were capsizing and took them to safety. Most became good American citizens working for a healthy and prosperous nation. Compare this to how we are tragically dealing with the crisis of immigrants today.",
      "\"Carter was farsighted. He put aside his short-term political interests to tackle challenges that demanded sacrifice to protect our kids and grandkids from harm one or two decades out. Very few people in the 1970's had heard the term \"climate change\". Yet Carter put his presidency on the line to pass laws to conserve energy, deregulate new oil and gas prices and invest in clean, renewable solar, wind and geothermal alternatives to fossil fuels. It wasn't a perfect program but, thanks to Carter, U.S. energy consumption declined 10% between 1979 and 1983. In many ways, he laid the foundation for future presidents to come to grips with climate change. Some thought he was crazy to fight so hard to pass these bills, but he was dead right.",
      "\"All of us know President Carter elevated human rights to the top of his agenda but sometimes we forget how seriously he pushed to advance the rights of women. He proposed and signed the law extending the period for states to approve the Equal Rights Amendment, which now, finally, has been ratified by three quarters of the states. He appointed women to head the Departments of Commerce, Education, HEW and HUD. Women on his White House staff played crucial roles in developing his highest priority energy and environmental proposals and laws deregulating our oil and gas, trucking and airline industries. And he dramatically increased the ranks of female circuit and district court judges, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In all he appointed five times as many women to the federal bench as all of his predecessors combined.",
      "\"Two decades ago, President Carter said he believed income inequality was the biggest global issue. Two years ago, in a speech in Lynchburg, he said \"I think now... it is the discrimination against women and girls in the world,\" including the brutal killing of female infants, sexual abuse, human trafficking, honor killings and the rest. He concluded that, until the stubborn attitudes that foster discrimination against women change, the world cannot advance and poverty and income inequality cannot be solved.",
      "\"Amen!",
      "\"Toward the end of our time in the White House, the President and I were talking about how we might describe what we tried to do. We came up with this sentence which to me remains an important summary of what we were trying to do. \"We told the truth, we obeyed the law and we kept the peace.\" That we did, Mr. President. I will always be proud and grateful to have had the chance to work with you toward these noble ends. It was then and always will be the most rewarding experience of my public career.\"",

      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",

      "While Wednesday's joke quickly ricocheted across social media feeds, it also set the tone for what a Sheinbaum-Trump relationship could look like in the coming years.",
      "\"Humor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\" said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"Although President Sheinbaum knows it won't work on everything - Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",
      "It comes after other stern but collaborative responses by Sheinbaum regarding Trump's proposals.",
      "On Trump's pitch to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, Sheinbaum warned that if the new U.S. administration imposes tariffs on Mexico, her administration would respond with similar measures. She said any sort of tax was \"not acceptable and would cause inflation and job losses for the United States and Mexico.\"",
      "She's taken a more concessionary tone on immigration, falling in line with years of Mexican efforts to block migrants from traveling north amid mounting pressure by the U.S.",
      "After originally saying her government would push the Trump administration to deport migrants directly back to their own countries, in January she said Mexico would be open to accepting deportees from other countries, but Mexico could limit it to certain nationalities or request compensation.",
      "Canada also gave a sarcastic response this week to Trump's recent comments about annexing America's northern neighbor. According to Canada's CTV News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was questioned by a reporter on Monday about Trump's multi-prong threats to\u00a0impose a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico\u00a0in the first hours of his presidency, as well as making Canada the \"51st state.\"",
      "\"You know something, to the president, I'll make him a counteroffer. How about if we buy Alaska, and we'll throw in Minnesota and Minneapolis at the same time,\" Ford said.",

      "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito said Wednesday that he had talked with Donald Trump about a job for one of his former law clerks in the president-elect's administration a day before Trump asked the Supreme Court to delay the sentencing in his New York \"hush money\" case.",
      "Alito said in a statement that the clerk, William Levi, had asked him to take a call from the president-elect \"regarding his qualifications to serve in a government position.\" The conservative justice also said that he and Trump \"did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the President-elect.\"",
      "\"We did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed,\" Alito said.",
      "Justices often recommend former clerks for top government and law firm jobs, but a direct call with a president appears unusual and comes as Trump has business before the court. Trump's lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to delay his sentencing in New York on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records connected to a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. He is currently scheduled to be sentenced Friday, and the judge in the case said he does not intend to sentence Trump to incarceration. He is also allowing him to appear virtually, instead of in person.",
      "Trump's attorneys argue the sentencing could disrupt the presidential transition and would violate the Supreme Court's previous ruling on immunity for former presidents in another case against Trump. The court has not yet responded.",

    "summary": "Disgraced former Rep. George Santos had his February sentencing delayed until April so he can keep making new episodes of his podcast.",
    "story": [
      "NEW YORK --\u00a0Disgraced former Congressman George Santos had his February sentencing delayed until April 25, a judge ruled Wednesday.",
      "That will give Santos, 36, additional time to keep making new episodes of his podcast, \"Pants on Fire with George Santos,\" presumably so that he can pay the money he owes the government.",
      "Back in August, Santos\u00a0pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He owes $578,752.92 as per his plea deal, including $373,749.97 in restitution and $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He is expected to go to prison for at least two years when he is sentenced, although the judge previously said the estimated sentencing range was between 6-8 years.",
      "In a letter to a judge last Friday, Santos' attorneys said their client is required to pay more than $200,000 in forfeiture money 30 days before he is sentenced. They said that, through his podcast, Santos \"now has a viable path to making meaningful progress in satisfying his obligations, requiring only additional time for the quarterly compensation structure to generate sufficient funds.\"",
      "They asked the judge to delay his sentencing from Feb. 7 until a Friday in August, but the judge only moved it 10 weeks.",
      "In a statement, Santos' defense attorney Joseph Murray said, \"It's unfortunate how unnecessarily difficult the government is making this process.\"",
      "Santos' attorneys said the podcast was initially meant to launch in September, but since it didn't actually get off the ground until December, they wanted more time to record more episodes.",
      "Delay sends a message that crime pays, prosecutors say",
      "Prosecutors had responded to the request for a delay in sentencing by saying Santos' claims of needing more time for the podcast to get off the ground were \"facially speculative, and, in any event, entirely insufficient to warrant such a lengthy adjournment.\"",
      "\"His request for delay should be denied, and sentencing should proceed as scheduled,\" they wrote. \"A delay to allow Santos to develop his podcast -- the title of which is a tone-deaf and unrepentant reference to the crimes he committed -- is presumptively unreasonable.\"",
      "Prosecutors also said Santos has already earned more than $400,000 from Cameo appearances and $400,000 for participating in a documentary. All of this is in addition to his $174,000 salary as a congressman. They took issue with a claim he made that he had less than $1,000 in liquid assets.",
      "\"Allowing Santos to stave off sentencing specifically to monetize his infamy would send a message that crime pays,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Delaying sentencing to give him further time to grow his podcast listenership would enable Santos to further use his criminal prosecution for personal benefit.\"",
      "\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"",
      "Constituents in New York's 3rd Congressional District formed an alliance two years ago to fight then-Rep. Santos, whose lies about his career and his past were unravelling before their eyes. They say their battle continues.",

      "When he was asked at a news conference Tuesday about the scope of the pardons for those convicted of assaulting police during the riot, Trump instead argued that there had been no guns among the thousands of his supporters who were part of the Capitol breach.",
      "\"There was never charges of insurrection or anything like that,\" Trump said of the Jan. 6 riot. \"But if there were, this would be the only insurrection in history where people went in as insurrectionists with not one gun.\"",

      "However, at some point before 2:45 p.m. that day, according to the Justice Department, \"Mazza lost possession of the revolver.\" Mazza was sentenced to five years in prison for carrying a gun and assaulting police officers.",
      "Christopher Alberts, who is from the Baltimore area, was convicted by a jury in Washington, D.C., of felony and misdemeanor charges including carrying a loaded gun onto Capitol grounds and assaulting law enforcement in his Jan. 6 case.

      "The government said in its criminal complaint that the photographs in evidence of Ibrahim's alleged firearm \"are of such high resolution that the serrations on the slide of Ibrahim's DEA firearm are visible.\"",
      "Mario Mares of Texas was found guilty in October for his role in the riot. The Justice Department, in announcing the verdict, said evidence was presented at trial that Mares and others had traveled from Texas to Virginia just before Jan. 6, 2021, \"carrying with them various firearms, including both handguns and rifles, as well as ammunition,\" according to a Justice Department news release.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",
      "More information on how X's Community Notes works can be found on X's Community Notes page.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

    "story": [
      "In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok could shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "\"Absent such relief, the Act will take effect on January 19, 2025,\" TikTok said in a Dec. 9 legal filing. \"That would shut down TikTok\u2014one of the Nation's most popular speech platforms \u2014 for its more than 170 million domestic monthly users on the eve of a presidential inauguration.\"",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "The TikTok ban heads to the Supreme Court tomorrow. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \"political resolution\" and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\"Rarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\" lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention,\u00a0experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \"no one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\"",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \"concedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\" TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Trump urges court to pause",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\"President Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\" D. John Sauer, Trump's choice to be his administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump's solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been changed to clarify that TikTok could shut down on Jan. 19 if the Supreme Court rules against its request for a temporary injunction that would overturn or delay a law that could lead to a U.S. ban.",

      "In announcing the social media giant's decision to end fact-checking\u00a0in the U.S. on Facebook, Instagram and other Meta platforms, Zuckerberg said the move would \"dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms.\" In a Facebook post explaining the company's shift to a community-driven moderation approach, Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan also said that \"Too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail'.\"",
      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "As Meta abandons fact-checking, here's how to tell what's real online",
      "But those running the nonpartisan entities behind Meta's third-party fact-checking efforts said they had nothing to do with whether a post was removed from a platform, noting that the company was the final arbiter of what content it published.",
      "\"Facts are not censorship. Fact-checkers never censored anything,\" Neil Brown, president of the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonprofit devoted to media literacy, said in a statement. Poynter's PolitiFact is among the entities that had teamed with Meta on fact-checking.",
      "Meta's official fact-check program launched in 2016 with a number of third-party partners.vFact-checked posts were labeled and then demoted, reducing their distribution. But the posts weren't removed outright, according to Meta. What does get removed are severe content violations like posts supporting terrorism or promoting child sexual exploitation.",
      "The sheer volume of content across Facebook, Instagram and other Meta apps means that most posts were not fact-checked. Further, fact checks were not allowed on politicians' posts.",
      "Fact-checked posts were labeled and then were demoted, reducing their distribution. Fact-checked posts were not removed outright. What does get removed are severe content violations like terrorism or child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"To my knowledge they didn't take anything down just because it was false \u2014 their takedowns were only with false information that could cause harm,\" Angie Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, which also works with Meta, told CBS News. \"My goal is for an internet where people can go on and find information that's accurate and reliable and this is a step back, there's no other way to put it.\"",
      "\"Fact-checking journalism has never censored or removed posts; it's added information and context to controversial claims, and it's debunked hoax content and conspiracy theories,\" Holan added in a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted on social media.",
      "\"Nothing to do with free speech\"",
      "Among Meta's fact-check partners, Poynter's PolitiFact said it offered independent reviews and disclosed its sources, while Meta set the rules about what content was removed.",
      "\"This decision has nothing to do with free speech or censorship,\" Aaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact and Poynter's vice president for sales and strategic partnerships,\u00a0posted\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"The decision to remove or penalize a post or account is made by Meta and Facebook, not fact checkers. They created the rules,\" he added.",
      "Lori Robertson, director of the nonpartisan website FactCheck.org, which also partnered with Meta, also refuted Zuckerberg's notion that fact-checking contributed to a suppression of opinion.",
      "\"Our work isn't about censorship. We provide accurate information to help social media users as they navigate their news feeds. We did not, and could not, remove content. Any decisions to do that were Meta's,\" she said.",
      "Another fact-checking outfit that works with Meta also questioned if shifting to a \"Community Notes\" model in which the technology giant relies on social media users to monitor posts, similar to the approach in use at Elon Musk's X platform (formerly known as Twitter), will reduce bias and improve the quality of content.",
      "\"In our experience and that of others, Community Notes on X are often slow to appear, sometimes downright inaccurate and unlikely to appear on controversial posts because of an inability to reach agreement or consensus among users,\" Maarten Schenk, co-founder and chief operating officer at Lead Stories, said in a post Tuesday on the fact-checking site. \"Ultimately, the truth doesn't care about consensus or agreement: the shape of the Earth stays the same even if social media users can't agree on it.\"",

      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",

      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

      "The Biden administration on Friday announced it would extend the temporary legal status of nearly 1 million immigrants from El Salvador, Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela, utilizing a program that is expected to be curtailed by the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The announcement will allow Salvadoran, Sudanese, Ukrainian and Venezuelan immigrants who currently have Temporary Protected Status to renew their work permits and deportation protections under the policy, which offers a legal reprieve to foreigners from countries beset by war, natural disasters or other emergencies that make deportations unsafe.",
      "The decision is set to benefit roughly 234,000 Salvadorans; 1,900 Sudanese; 104,000 Ukrainians; and 600,000 Venezuelans, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the programs. The TPS program for El Salvador will be extended through March 2026, while the designations for Sudan, Ukraine and Venezuela will be extended through October 2026.",
      "Friday's move is notable since TPS is expected to be scaled back by the President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to dismantle Biden administration immigration policy, enact tougher immigration rules and launch a mass deportation campaign. TPS designations can be revoked by the DHS secretary, as long as the government provides a 60-day notice.",
      "Trump and incoming Vice President JD Vance have both signaled their opposition to TPS, which Republican lawmakers and immigration hawks have long argued has been improperly extended, despite its temporary nature. During Trump's first administration, the government tried to end TPS protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, though its efforts were stalled by legal challenges.",
      "While it announced the TPS extensions, the Biden administration on Friday declined to make new arrivals eligible for the temporary status, despite calls from progressive activists who say the move would make it harder for Trump to carry out his promised mass deportations. Redesignating the TPS program for Venezuela, for example, would make hundreds of thousands of additional migrants eligible for the initiative.",
      "The Biden administration has also faced pressure from advocates to allow hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan immigrants to apply for TPS ahead of Trump's inauguration. But officials are leaning against it, two people familiar with internal deliberations told CBS News, in part due to concerns about the move appearing like a politically motivated effort to hinder the incoming administration.",
      "Friday's move affects a diverse population of immigrants, with different legal circumstances.",
      "Salvadorans with TPS have generally been in the U.S. for over two decades, since 2001, when immigrants from El Salvador were first granted the temporary status following devastating earthquakes in the small Central American country.",
      "Most of the Venezuelans enrolled in the TPS program crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally or entered the country under Biden administration programs designed to reduce illegal immigration over the past four years. They have arrived in the U.S. as part of a larger exodus from Venezuela that has seen 8 million people flee economic calamity and government repression in the South American nation.",
      "Ukrainian TPS holders, by and large, were either processed at the California-Mexico border in early 2022 soon after Russia invaded their homeland or flew to the U.S. under a Biden administration initiative that has allowed private citizens to sponsor Ukrainian refugees.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has been sentenced in his New York \"hush money\" trial. Here's what happened with the case.",
    "story": [
      "NEW YORK --\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump was sentenced to unconditional discharge Friday, a symbolic end to his New York \"hush money\" case.",
      "The sentence carries neither jail time nor any other restrictions that might impede his inauguration on Jan. 20.",
      "In May, a jury\u00a0found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts\u00a0of falsifying business records.",
      "What happened in the courtroom",
      "The president-elect appeared virtually for the hearing from his Mar-a-Lago home, side by side with defense attorney Todd Blanche.\u00a0 They were seated with American flags behind them.",
      "Just prior to the proceeding, Trump and Blanche could be seen being jovial, appearing to laugh and joke with one another, CBS News New York's Alice Gainer reported.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg was present in court for the sentencing. The courtroom itself was bitterly cold, due to an apparently broken window in a nearby restroom that was open.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump supporters and anti-Trump demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse in Manhattan.",
      "When proceedings began, prosecutors spoke, saying they too recommended a sentence of unconditional discharge. They said Trump was found guilty, that he falsified 34 separate entries with the intent to defraud to promote his own election, Gainer reported. As they said that, Trump shook his head \"no,\" crossed his arms, and appeared to take notes.",
      "Prosecutors went on to say that Trump was far from expressing remorse, and engaged in a campaign to undermine the court's legitimacy. Prosecutors said Trump attacked the rule of law itself, Gainer reported.",
      "Then Blanche spoke, calling Friday a sad day, saying they intend to pursue an appeal, and that Trump and his family were very upset about the entire thing.",
      "Trump then addressed the court, repeating much of what he said to cameras during the trial.",
      "\"It's been a political witch hunt,\" Trump said. \"It was done to damage my reputation so that I'd lose the election, and obviously, that didn't work.\"",
      "Trump also spoke about the gag order he was under, said he was treated very unfairly, and called the case an embarrassment to New York, Gainer reported.",
      "\"The fact is, I'm totally innocent,\" he added. \"I did nothing wrong.\"",
      "Before imposing the sentence, Judge Juan Merchan had the last word.",
      "\"Never before has this court been presented with such a unique and remarkable set of circumstances,\" he said. \"The protections afforded the office of the president are not a mitigating factor, they do not reduce the seriousness of the crime... The only lawful sentence that permits entry of a judgement of conviction without encroaching on highest office in land is an unconditional discharge.\"",
      "The judge also wished Trump godspeed as he begins his second term.",
      "Trump's attorneys are appealing the verdict.",
      "Gainer covered the trial from the start and breaks down the timeline of what led up to sentencing.",
      "From the National Enquirer to \"Access Hollywood\"",
      "In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for president.",
      "In August 2015, his then-personal attorney Michael Cohen and American Media Inc. CEO David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer, met at Trump Tower. Prosecutors say they formed a conspiracy to bury negative information about Trump in order to help get him elected.",
      "Pecker testified about two \"catch and kill\" deals, where he bought and then did not publish accusations against Trump \u2014 one, with Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Trump.",
      "In August 2016, Pecker paid McDougal $150,000, structuring the agreement to get around campaign finance law, telling the jury, \"We didn't want the story to embarrass Mr. Trump or embarrass or hurt the campaign.\"",
      "In September 2016, Cohen secretly recorded a conversation with Trump, allegedly about paying him back. \"We'll have to pay him something,\" Trump was heard saying. Pecker testified he ultimately did not need to be paid back.",
      "On Oct. 7, 2016, the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, where Trump is caught on a hot microphone talking about groping women, was released. Former Trump aide Hope Hicks testified it was a \"damaging development\" for the campaign.",
      "\"Hush-money\" payments for Playboy model, adult film star",
      "On Oct. 27, 2016, days before the election, Cohen paid adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. Cohen testified that before paying her, Trump was polling very poorly with women and if Daniels' story got out, Trump thought \"women will hate me.\"",
      "In February 2017, Cohen says he met Trump at the White House and talked about reimbursement. Cohen said he submitted false invoices for legal services, and Trump signed off on monthly checks of $35,000.",
      "The defense countered Cohen was his attorney and did work for Trump and his family in 2017. But Cohen maintained he did less than 10 hours of work that year for them and never billed them.",
      "Trump faced\u00a034 felony counts of falsifying business records, and the jury found him guilty on all counts.",
      "Question of presidential immunity",
      "Sentencing was set for July 11, but was postponed at the defense's request after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on presidential immunity. It was again postponed to September, and then again to after the election.",
      "It was pushed back again after Trump won, so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on how to proceed. Trump's attorneys filed to dismiss, saying it was unconstitutional to hold criminal proceedings related to a president-elect.",
      "Judge Merchan denied the motion, writing, the \"defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",
      "His attorneys tried multiple times to request a stay of the sentencing while they appeal, taking it all the way to the Supreme Court. All requests were denied.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

      "Ming Pan, a hydrologist at the University of California-San Diego's Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes, tracks the state's water supplies. He put Southern California's dryness into perspective using charts and maps.",
      "How dry is Southern California right now?",
      "In early January, the soil moisture in much of Southern California was in the bottom 2% of historical records for that day in the region. That's extremely low.",
      "Hydrologists in California watch the sky very closely starting in October, when California's water year begins.",
      "The state gets very little rain from May through September, so late fall and winter are crucial to fill reservoirs and to build up the snowpack to provide water. California relies on the Sierra snowpack for about one-third of its freshwater supply.",
      "However, Southern California started out the 2024-25 water year pretty dry. The region got some rain from an atmospheric river in November, but not much. After that, most of the atmospheric rivers that hit the West Coast from October into January veered northward into Washington, Oregon and Northern California instead.",
      "When the air is warm and dry, transpiration and evaporation also suck water out of the plants and soil. That leaves dry vegetation that can provide fuel for flying embers to spread wildfires, as the Los Angeles area saw in early January.",
      "So, while Northern California's water and snowpack conditions are in good shape, Southern California is much drier and its water storage is not doing so well.",
      "The Southern Sierra snowpack was starting to dip below normal in early January.",
      "What can California expect for the rest of 2025?",
      "The U.S. Climate Prediction Center's seasonal outlook through March suggests that drought is likely to develop in the region in the coming months.",
      "The outlook takes into account forecasts for La Ni\u00f1a, an ocean temperature pattern that was on its way to developing in the Pacific Ocean in early 2025. La Ni\u00f1a tends to mean drier conditions in Southern California. However, not every La Ni\u00f1a affects California in the same way.",
      "One or two big rain events could completely turn the table for Southern California's water situation. In 2023, California saw atmospheric rivers in April.",
      "So, it's hard to say this early in the season how dry Southern California will be in the coming months, but it's clear that people in dry areas need to pay attention to the risks.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 11:57:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Renard Spivey was found not guilty of his wife's murder, but he says he still can't sleep at night.",
    "story": [
      "Former Texas sheriff's deputy Renard Spivey had a long television career as the courtroom bailiff on the show \"Justice for All with Judge Cristina Perez.\" In 2019, his life changed drastically when he was arrested for his wife's murder.",
      "Shortly after 3 a.m. on July 28, 2019, police were called to the Houston home of Renard and his 52-year-old wife Patricia. When first responders arrived, they found Patricia dead in the closet with multiple gunshot entry and exit wounds. Renard, 63, had a bullet wound in his leg. He told first responders that he and his wife had been arguing and were tussling over his gun when it fired. Officers doubted Renard's claims.",
      "They wondered why a man of Renard's size \u2014 6'3\" and around 290 pounds \u2014  would need to struggle with his wife, who was just 5'6\", over a gun. They also questioned how a gun could go off multiple times by accident. Renard was charged with his wife's murder. CBS News consultant and former prosecutor Lisa Andrews explains, \"The multiple shots is definitely what gives everyone a lot of pause as to why it's not an accident.\"",
      "In his first-ever interview, Renard Spivey sat down with \"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales to tell his story in \"Deputy Spivey On Trial,\" airing Saturday, Jan. 11 at 10/9c on CBS and Paramount+.",
      "On the evening of July 27, 2019, Renard says he and his wife were having a quiet night at their Houston home. But, he says, they soon began arguing and Patricia confronted him, asking if he was having an affair.",
      "\"I told her no, that's crazy,\" says Renard.",
      "Renard says Patricia's suspicions stemmed from the recent lack of intimacy in their relationship. Still, Renard says, he tried to give Patricia a kiss before bed, but she was not interested in affection. He said when he approached her, she turned her phone away so he couldn't see it.",
      "\"And every time I walk over to her, she turned her phone down and then I was trying to kiss her. She said, 'I'm not kissing you.'\"",
      "Renard says he was disturbed by this and curious about what was on Patricia's phone. When he thought Patricia was asleep, he says, he grabbed her phone from her nightstand and took it into the closet. He says, moments later, Patricia appeared in the doorway holding his gun and demanding her phone.",
      "\"And then when I turned around and saw her finger on the trigger, I was scared for my life,\" Renard says.",
      "Renard, then a deputy with the Harris County Sheriff's Office, says he thought the best plan was to try to get the weapon out of his wife's hands. He says he tried and, during the struggle, the gun went off.",
      "\"Everything happened so fast,\" says Renard. \"When I grabbed the top of the weapon, she pulled back with a finger on the trigger and it went off and shot me in the leg.\"",
      "The gun fired two more times, Renard says, hitting Patricia in the arm and the chest. Renard called 911 and told the operator, \"Shots fired.\" According to Renard, Patricia was still breathing. He attempted chest compressions as the operator guided him. On the 911 call, Renard can be heard struggling.",
      "\"It was really emotional because the thing is that it's my wife, you know?\" Renard says. \"And you try to save your wife and you've been shot.\"",
      "Patricia was declared dead at the scene.",
      "Renard was detained and transported to a local hospital for treatment for the gunshot wound in his leg. At the hospital, detectives wanted to interview Renard, but he refused. Renard told \"48 Hours\" that at the time, he had been advised against providing a statement by his union rep, who was an attorney.",
      "While he waited for trial, Renard's attorneys requested bail, which was set at $50,000. Renard made bail and was released on the judge's conditions, which included barring Renard from attending Patricia's funeral.",
      "\"That's my wife. I was in love with my wife. Why not be there?\" Renard said. \"I just wanted to pay my respects. That's all.\"",
      "Four-and-a-half years passed between Patricia's death and Renard's trial for her murder. During that time, Renard said he mostly spent time with family, exercised at the gym and went to church.",
      "Renard's trial began in November 2023. He was represented by the famed DeGuerin family of lawyers \u2014  led by Dick DeGuerin. His attorneys presented a case that Patricia's death was not intentional. Renard took the stand and testified in his own defense.",
      "\"I was instructed by my \u2014  my attorneys to do so, because if I didn't, it felt like I was, you know, guilty of something, trying to hide something, which I wasn't,\" Renard says.",
      "DeGuerin showed Morales just how plausible an accidental shooting would be with this type of gun.",
      "\"There is no external safety on this gun,\" DeGuerin says. \"So, if someone's finger is on that trigger, all it takes is a slight pressure and it goes off.\"",
      "The case went to the jury. As a former bailiff, seeing a jury enter a courtroom was nothing new for Renard. But this jury would decide his fate. After 12 hours of deliberations over two days, they came back with a verdict: not guilty.",
      "\"I fall to the floor crying. Boohoo crying. My attorneys help pick me up,\" says Renard.",

    "story": [
      "Employers added 256,000 jobs in December, blowing past economists' expectations and signaling that the job market remains resilient in the face of still-high borrowing rates and stickier-than-expected inflation.",
      "The economy was expected to add 153,000 jobs last month, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate in December stepped down to 4.1%, lower than the forecast that the rate would remain steady at 4.2%.",
      "Hiring was strongest in the health care, government and social assistance industries, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday. Retail companies also added jobs last month, after a decline in November.",
      "The Jan. 10 jobs report marks the last monthly employment snapshot of the Biden administration, which inherited an economy scarred by the pandemic. When Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, the jobless rate stood at 6.4%, while inflation was about to soar to 40-year highs, kicking off a flurry of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve to tame price increases.",
      "Under the Fed's restrictive monetary policy, the economy has cooled, dampening inflation but also creating some cracks in the labor market. At the same time, the incoming Trump administration's policies, if enacted, are expected to be inflationary, prompting some economists to predict that the central bank may hold off on cutting rates at its January 29 meeting.",
      "Fewer Fed cuts?",
      "The robust jobs report may also ease pressure on the Fed to continue to cut rates, given the Fed Chair Jerome Powell had cited some earlier signs of weakness in the labor market as one reason why the central bank began cutting rates in September.",
      "\"The solid December employment report will solidify the Fed's intentions to proceed with the slower pace of interest rate cuts it signaled at its December meeting,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"Officials have been a bit disappointed at the uneven pace of progress in lowering inflation, and the data should ease any fears that keeping rates on hold will pose a significant risk to the labor market.\"",
      "The Fed in December trimmed its benchmark for a third straight month amid signs that the economy was gearing down. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September when it last issued economic projections.",
      "Some economists think the Fed could lower borrowing costs one once in 2025, while others expect more cuts.",
      "\"Our own baseline continues to assume three rate cuts this year, one more than signaled by the Fed, with the first to come in March,\"Vanden Houten said. \"The December report increases the risk that the Fed will remain on hold in March and that we only see two cuts this year, particularly if policies on tariffs and immigration implemented by the incoming Trump administration are more inflationary than currently incorporated in our baseline.\"",

      "Rudy Giuliani is set to appear in a Washington, D.C., federal courtroom Friday as a federal judge considers a request from two Georgia election workers to hold the former New York City mayor in contempt for allegedly continuing to defame them in violation of a court order.",
      "A jury in 2023 awarded Ruby Freeman and daughter Shaye Moss $148 million to be paid by Giuliani for falsely claiming the pair engaged in a fake ballot processing scheme in Fulton County, Georgia, during the 2020 presidential election. The federal judge overseeing the case, Beryl Howell, determined Giuliani was liable for defaming Freeman and Moss after they became focal points of his unfounded claims.",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Israeli military strikes killed more than 600 people in the Gaza Strip in the first 10 days of 2025, pushing the death toll over 46,000 since the war began on Oct. 7, 2023, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian territory's health ministry, and one new estimate suggests it could be much higher. Israel launched the war after Hamas carried out its unprecedented terrorist attack, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "The total number of dead in Gaza represents a little more than 2% of the tiny enclave's population, with an average of about 3,000 people killed each month or 100 killed each day since Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel 15 months ago.",
      "Israel has rejected the figures provided by Palestinian officials and blames Hamas for all deaths in Gaza, accusing the group of using civilians as human shields. But new research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests the figure provided by the Gazan health ministry for the first nine months of the war could have been understated by as much as 40%.",
      "Gaza death toll an underestimate, Lancet study suggests",
      "From the beginning of the war through June 30, 2024, Gaza's heath ministry said just under 38,000 people had been killed by traumatic injuries, but the Lancet's estimate \u2014 published in a peer-reviewed study based on data from health authorities, social media obituaries and an online survey \u2014 was that more than 64,000 people had been killed during that time.",
      "CBS News is unable to independently verify the numbers, and Israeli authorities have prevented Western journalists from entering Gaza to report independently since the war started.",
      "The Lancet noted that its estimate does not include thousands more people still believed to be buried under rubble, or those who have died from a lack of access to food, water or medical care during the war.",
      "\"I am broken inside after losing my family,\" 21-year-old Mahmoud Sukkar told CBS News' local team in Gaza. All 17 members of his family were killed, including his mother, father and twin brother, when an Israeli strike hit their home in Gaza City in the first month of the war.",
      "Sukkar, the only survivor, now lives alone in a tent camp in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.",

      "Israel continues attacking Houthis in Yemen",
      "As Israel continues its strikes against the remnants of Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces said Friday that its naval and air forces had struck multiple Houthi rebel targets on Yemen's west coast and inland, including ports and a power station.",
      "The Houthis, like Hamas, are backed by Iran, and they've launched repeated missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping, U.S. and Israeli military vessels and Israeli territory in support of their allies since the war in Gaza began. The U.S. has also carried out many strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen over the last year.",
      "\"The Houthi terrorist regime is a central part of the Iranian axis of terror, and their attacks on international shipping vessels and routes continue to destabilize the region and the wider world,\" said the IDF in a statement.",
      "\"As we promised \u2014 the Houthis are paying, and will continue to pay, a heavy price for their aggression against us,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a separate statement.",
      "Progress, but no breakthroughs in ceasefire talks",
      "Iin Doha, Qatar, meanwhile, American and Arab negotiators have made \"real progress\" this week toward a deal between Israel and Hamas for a ceasefire and hostage release in the waning days of the Biden administration, the U.S. president said Thursday, but it has not appeared sufficient for any major breakthrough to be announced, or to warrant higher-level officials flying back to the region.",
      "\"We're making some real progress, I met with negotiators today,\" Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House. \"I'm still hopeful that we will be able to have a prisoner exchange. Hamas is the one getting in the way of that exchange right now, but I think we may be able to get that done, we need to get it done.\"",
      "U.S. envoys Amos Hochstein and Brett McGurk had been working to hammer out the technical details of a proposal, but Israeli intelligence chief David Barnea did not fly to Doha this week as Israeli media had said he might, and there was no indication that CIA chief William Burns was in Qatar, either. Both men have joined the talks repeatedly when there's been hope of a potential agreement.",
      "One apparent sticking point in the talks has been the unconfirmed condition of 34 Israeli hostages in Gaza who were listed on a document that Hamas resurfaced this week after it first emerged last summer. Israel has demanded to know who on the list is still alive and who is dead. Hamas demanded a four-day ceasefire to contact its network of militants across Gaza to confirm the hostages' condition, saying Israel's ongoing operations made it impossible for the group to assess otherwise.",
      "Family members and friends of the hostages have protested regularly in Israel to demand that Netanyahu's government strike a deal to bring them all home at the same time. Israeli officials believe about 100 hostages are still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza, though at least 30 are believed to be dead.",
      "If a ceasefire does take shape, the first phase would involve a swap of hostages for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, along with a surge in humanitarian assistance into Gaza.",
      "But another major hurdle is Hamas' consistent demand that Israeli forces completely withdraw from the Gaza Strip \u2014 something Israel has thus far refused to accept.",
      "Some Israelis and Palestinians hope for \"help from Donald Trump\"",
      "If a deal is not achieved by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, some Israelis \u2014 and Palestinians \u2014 hope he will bring a needed change to the negotiations, potentially for the better.",
      "\"He is unpredictable and he is brave,\" Ilay David, brother of 24-year-old hostage Eyvatar David, told CBS News at a rally in Jerusalem on Friday afternoon. \"We have to think out of the box, and Trump can bring that change.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump is known for being mostly a businessman,\" said 19-year-old Palestinian cybersecurity student Ameen Abu Fkheida at Birzeit University in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. \"I don't think he will be a friend [of Palestinians], but I do think there will be some sort of help from Donald Trump regarding the case of Gaza, which could probably be a ceasefire or an exchange of prisoners or something to deescalate the current situation in Gaza.\"",

      "Zelenskyy spoke at a meeting of about 50 allies at the American military's Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the last such gathering before Trump takes office on January 20. His imminent return to the White House has cast doubt on future American support for Ukraine's war effort, given previous favorable remarks about Russia's authoritarian President Vladimir Putin and Trump's vow to quickly end the war nearly three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "While he's offered no clear indication as to how he intends to achieve that, many in Ukraine and across Europe are concerned Trump could make good on the promise by withholding aid to Ukraine and pushing Zelenskyy to negotiate a truce that lets Russia maintain control over some of the vast territory is has occupied in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.",
      "\"It's clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world \u2014 just 11 days from now, a time when we have to cooperate even more, rely on one another even more, and achieve even greater results together,\" said Zelenskyy, adding that he saw it \"as a time of opportunities.\"",
      "As the grinding war nears the three-year mark, which it will hit on Feb. 24, Zelenskyy repeated a call for Western allies to send troops to help Ukraine.",
      "\"Our goal is to find as many instruments as possible to force Russia into peace,\" he told the meeting. \"I believe that such deployment of partners' contingents is one of the best instruments.\"",

      "Standing before a 17th-century world map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" or \"Mexican America,\" because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",

      "Prosecutors say Ebisawa didn't know he was communicating in 2021 and 2022 with a confidential source for the Drug Enforcement Administration along with the source's associate, who posed as an Iranian general. Ebisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting.",
      "DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a release that the prosecution demonstrated the DEA's \"unparalleled ability to dismantle the world's most dangerous criminal networks.\"",

      "\"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma,\" he added.",
      "Court papers said Ebisawa \u2014 who U.S. prosecutors say is a leader of Japan's notorious Yakuza mafia \u2014 told the DEA's confidential source in 2020 that he had access to a large quantity of nuclear materials that he wanted to sell. To support his claim, he sent the source photographs depicting rocky substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation, claiming they contained thorium and uranium, the papers said.",
      "The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an \"ethnic insurgent group\" in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, prosecutors said. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege.",
      "Prosecutors said samples of the alleged nuclear materials were obtained and a U.S. federal lab found they contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that the \"the isotope composition of the plutonium\" was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon.",
      "Last year, prosecutors posted photos of the purported nuclear materials allegedly sent by Ebisawa.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Ebisawa conspired to sell 500 kilograms of methamphetamine and 500 kilograms of heroin to an undercover agent to be distributed in New York. He also allegedly worked to launder $100,000 in purported narcotics proceeds from the U.S. to Japan.",
      "\"As he admitted in federal court today, Takeshi Ebisawa brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York. \"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma and laundered what he believed to be drug money from New York to Tokyo.\"",

      "Some Iranian analysts who are critical of the government and spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said the drills may be a demonstration of power by Iran prompted by the dramatic changes in the balance of power in the Middle East \u2014 with Israel severely disabling Iranian-backed groups in Gaza and Lebanon, and long-time Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad being toppled by rebel forces.",

      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",

In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of fentanyl \u2014 a synthetic opioid 50 times more potent than heroin \u2014 as well as chemical precursors.

      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 An Italian journalist detained in Iran for three weeks and whose fate became intertwined with that of an Iranian engineer wanted by the United States was freed Wednesday and is heading home, Italian officials announced.",
      "A plane carrying Cecilia Sala took off from Tehran after \"intensive work on diplomatic and intelligence channels,\" Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said, adding that Meloni had informed Sala's parents of the news.",
      "Iranian media acknowledged the journalist's release, citing only the foreign reports. Iranian officials offered no immediate comment.",
      "Sala, a 29-year-old reporter for the Il Foglio daily, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, three days after she arrived on a journalist visa. She was accused of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic, the official IRNA news agency said, but no details of her purported transgressions were ever provided by Iranian officials.",
      "Word of Sala's release was met with cheers in Italy, where her plight had dominated headlines, as lawmakers hailed the successful negotiations to bring her home.",
      "It came after Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida last weekend to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Meloni tweeted Sala's return in a statement on X in which she thanked \"all those who helped make Cecilia's return possible, allowing her to reembrace her family and colleagues.\"",
      "Italian commentators had speculated that Iran was holding Sala as a bargaining chip to ensure the release of Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport three days before on Dec. 16, on a U.S. warrant. Iranian analysts who spoke with CBS News on the condition they remain anonymous said the same thing.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department accused Abedini and another Iranian of supplying drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. He remains in detention in Italy.",

      "Genetically engineered mosquitoes with toxic semen could be a new weapon against tropical disease, Australian scientists said after trialing the novel pest control method.",
      "The \"toxic male technique\" aims to breed mosquitoes that express venomous proteins in their semen, killing off females after mating.",
      "Female mosquitoes are targeted because only they bite and drink blood, thereby spreading diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.",
      "Scientist Sam Beach from Australia's Macquarie University said the method \"could work as quickly as pesticides without also harming beneficial species.\"",
      "\"This innovative solution could transform how we manage pests, offering hope for healthier communities and a more sustainable future,\" Beach said.",

      "\"We still need to implement it in mosquitoes and conduct rigorous safety testing to ensure there are no risks to humans or other non-target species,\" he said.",
      "The mosquitoes would need to be genetically modified so they only expressed the toxic semen once they were released into the wild, the researchers said.",
      "This could be done through so-called \"conditional expression\" techniques, which use chemicals or other biological triggers to turn specific genes on or off at will.",
      "This would allow venomous males to successfully mate with females in lab conditions, producing enough viable offspring for the technique to be scaled up.",
      "Genetic engineering has been used for years to control populations of disease-spreading mosquitoes.",

      "\"The RSF and RSF-aligned militias have continued to direct attacks against civilians. The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys \u2014 even infants \u2014 on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,\" Blinken said. \"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "In May 2024, the Human Rights Watch organization said the RSF and its allies could have been guilty of genocide against non-Arab ethnic communities over a specific series of attacks in the western region of Darfur. The RSF has been widely accused of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and war crimes since the war broke out.",
      "The International Criminal Court has been investigating ethnic-based killings in Darfur and has said it has \"grounds to believe\" that both the paramilitaries and the Sudanese army have committed unspecified \"Rome Statute crimes,\" which include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The ICC's investigation continues.",
      "Why is there a civil war in Sudan?",
      "Fighting broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF in April 2023 after months of tension between the two top generals who had been running the country. The former allies in charge of the SAF and the RSF had been negotiating to fully integrate the RSF into the army before the formation of a new transitional government. Those negotiations broke down and the two sides went to war.",
      "After war broke out, the U.S. government, along with international partners, unsuccessfully tried to broker a peace agreement.",
      "Journalists and aid officials have largely been blocked from traveling to the country to report on the conflict first-hand, but independent researchers say the number of deaths from the war has been vastly unreported.",
      "According to a study published in November by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, an estimated 61,000 people were killed in Khartoum State alone, home to the capital city of the same name, between April 2023 and June 2024.",
      "The study found that more than 90% of those deaths went unrecorded, but the estimated toll was considerably higher than previously believed.",
      "\"Our findings reveal the severe and largely invisible impact of the war on Sudanese lives, especially of preventable disease and starvation, said the report's lead author Dr. Maysoon Dahab, adding that \"the overwhelming level of killings\" in the central Kordofan and western Darfur regions \"indicate wars within a war.\"",
      "\"Today's action is part of our continued efforts to promote accountability for all warring parties whose actions fuel this conflict,\" Blinken said Tuesday. \"The United States does not support either side of this war.\"",
      "What is genocide?",
      "The United Nations adopted the\u00a0Genocide Convention\u00a0in 1948 after the Holocaust committed by Nazi Germany. In it, genocide is defined as any one of a series of acts, \"committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\" Those acts include:",

      "U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy warned in a recent advisory about alcohol use increasing cancer risk.",

      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",

      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke to the experts to get the skinny on this latest trend.",
      "What is microdosing?",
      "Microdosing Ozempic refers to using smaller amounts compared to the\u00a0standard therapeutic doses that are traditionally prescribed for managing type 2 diabetes and aiding weight loss, experts say.",
      "This practice is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "IS EATING ONCE A DAY A GOOD IDEA? EXPERTS SHARE VARYING OPINIONS ON THE \u2018OMAD DIET\u2019",

      "\"Health care clinicians do not typically recommend this approach.\"",

      "Benefits of microdosing",
      "The primary reason for microdosing is to reduce costs, according to McGowan.",
      "For example, he said, a patient might think that if a full prescription costs over $250 per week, they may be able to achieve some benefit with just $25 worth of the medication.",
      "With approximately 70% of American adults meeting the criteria for being obese or overweight, more people are turning to weight loss medications to help them shed pounds. (iStock)",
      "The average monthly retail price of Ozempic ranges from $1,000 or more without insurance, per GoodRx.",
      "People may also pursue microdosing to reduce the incidence or severity of side effects such as nausea, vomiting or stomach discomfort, according to Stanford.",

      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "Any potential benefit of the medication, however, will likely wane proportionally with lower doses, experts noted.",
      "Individuals may also microdose due to supply challenges, according to Dr. Amy Rothberg,\u00a0clinical professor of medicine in the Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes at the University of Michigan.",
      "\"Some individuals might start with microdoses to gradually acclimate their body to the medication, potentially easing into the full therapeutic dose over time.\" (iStock)",

      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",
      "\"Microdosing Ozempic or other [weight-loss] medications is entirely off-label and unproven, with no supporting clinical studies,\" he cautioned.",
      "OZEMPIC COULD HELP REDUCE ALZHEIMER\u2019S RISK FOR SOME, STUDY SUGGESTS: \u2018SHIFTING THE PARADIGM\u2019",

      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "People who microdose often use a \"compounded\" version of the medication,\u00a0which the FDA does not regulate.",
      "\"This introduces risks such as contamination, inconsistent formulations and uncertainty about the actual strength of the product being injected,\" McGowan stated.",
      "Without changes to diet and physical activity patterns, the long-term benefits will disappear once the drug is stopped, one doctor noted. (iStock)",
      "Additionally, these compounded versions are usually dispensed in vials, which requires a syringe to draw it up, in contrast to the FDA-approved versions that are simpler to use.",
      "Using the compounded versions through vials runs the risk of drawing up too much medication \u2014 so instead of\u00a0microdosing, it's possible to macrodose, Sowa warned.",
      "Medical supervision is key",

The mandates restrict how much water can be diverted to storage, even during wet years.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from fake apps",
      "1. Download apps only from official stores:\u00a0Always use trusted app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store to download apps. These platforms have security measures to detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it. Look at the developer's name and ensure it matches the official company behind the app. Fake apps often copy the names of popular apps but use slightly altered spellings or extra characters. For example, a fake might be called \"PayPaal\" instead of \"PayPal.\"",

      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

It charges your devices while you're chilling outdoors. What makes it special? Perovskite solar cells that are seriously impressive. These cells are about 30% more powerful than traditional solar cells in bright sunlight and perform twice as well in low light. The umbrella can pump out 80 watts of power through USB-C and even has an XT-60 connection to power things like Anker's new EverFrost electric cooler. So you could literally keep your drinks cold and your phone charged at the same time. While they haven't announced the price yet, you can expect to see this tech to hit stores sometime in spring or summer.",

Samsung Food can track your grocery deliveries, build shopping lists from your fridge contents and even suggest meal plans. Samsung's calling it the \"ultimate AI sous chef,\" and honestly, they might be onto something. Sure, the AI won't actually cook for you (bummer, right?). But for wannabe home chefs who get inspired by every cooking show and movie, this could be a total game-changer. Just don't blame Samsung if you end up spending more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking. Of course, you'll need a 2025 Samsung TV to access this culinary magic. Samsung Food will be available on the QN90F, QN80F and QN70F model TVs.",

      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",
      "The first company to shed light on the campaign was cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven, one of whose employees were targeted by a phishing attack on December 24, allowing the threat actors to publish a malicious version of the extension.",
      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",
      "In some cases, developers themselves may unknowingly include data-gathering code as part of a monetization software development kit, which stealthily exfiltrates detailed browsing data. This makes it difficult to determine whether a compromise is the result of a hacking campaign or an intentional inclusion by the developer.",

      "1) Verify emails and links before clicking:\u00a0Many attacks begin with\u00a0phishing emails that impersonate trusted entities like Google Chrome Web Store Developer Support. These emails often create a false sense of urgency, urging you to click on malicious links. Always verify the sender\u2019s email address and avoid clicking on links without double-checking their authenticity. When in doubt, go directly to the official website rather than using a provided link.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Having strong antivirus software is an essential line of defense against malicious software. These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

It allows you to share your exact position with specific contacts, along with useful details like your device\u2019s battery level or your estimated arrival time if you\u2019re navigating.",

      "1. Stick to official app stores:\u00a0Always download apps from trusted platforms like the App Store for iOS or the Google Play Store for Android. These stores have built-in security measures that help detect and remove fake or harmful apps. Avoid downloading apps from random websites or third-party stores, as they are more likely to host malicious software. Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "3. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement\u00a02FA for your VPN accounts to add an extra layer of security beyond just a password.",
      "4. Keep software updated: Regularly update all VPN-related software, including clients, servers and associated networking hardware, to benefit from the latest security patches and improvements.",
      "5. Use strong encryption: Look for VPN services that use robust encryption protocols like AES-256 to protect your data.",
      "6. Monitor VPN traffic: Continuously monitor VPN traffic and logs for unusual patterns that might indicate security issues.",
      "7. Invest in strong antivirus software: A strong antivirus program can help detect and remove malware before it compromises your device. Many antivirus apps also come with features like web protection, anti-phishing tools and the ability to scan new apps for threats. While there are free options, premium versions often provide more comprehensive protection. Look for a trusted name in cybersecurity when choosing an antivirus solution.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

    "story": [
      "You'll wonder how you functioned without an AirTag.",
      "Apple AirTags can be a great way to outsmart car thieves, but there are some drawbacks to consider. A key limitation is that thieves who also have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are trying to steal. This makes hiding an AirTag tricky.",
      "That\u2019s why we were intrigued by Brian\u2019s inquiry about using other ways to make Apple AirTags undetectable to car thieves or outsmarting them twice.",
      "\"If an AirTag is put in an RFID wallet and hidden in a car, can the AirTag be located by a thief using a locator? I know the AirTag will function in the wallet, but will it be undetectable by the thief?\" \u2014 Brian, LaSalle, Illinois",

      "Illustration of a car thief checking to see if the vehicle has an AirTag. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",
      "Some thieves use RFID readers, which use radio waves, to scan and read data such as credit cards in wallets. The function of RFID wallets and bags is to protect items or devices from these radio waves by blocking them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",
      "A person holding an RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DO EMF BLOCKERS REALLY PROTECT US?",
      "What can block AirTag technology?",
      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

      "Multiple security experts have told Fox News' Garrett Tenney the current bollard system, even if in place, would not have been strong enough to stop Jabbar\u2019s attack because of the low crash ratings of the system being installed and the size and high speeds the F-150 truck reached.",

    "title": "Lebanon's new president strikes a nationalistic tone amid regional shifts, further weakening of Hezbollah",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 06:21:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Lebanese parliament finally voted on a new president on Thursday following two years of deadlock. Joseph Aoun the head of the country&apos;s armed forces won a majority of the votes.",
    "story": [
      "Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari says Hezbollah was planning to use bunker to stage attack on Israel. (Credit: IDF)",
      "Lebanon\u2019s political landscape has undergone a dramatic shift with the election of Joseph Aoun as president. After more than two years of political deadlock, the Lebanese Parliament elected the army commander on Thursday with 99 out of 128 votes.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election represents a significant achievement for the anti-Hezbollah camp, reflecting the weakening influence of the powerful Shia terrorist organization within Lebanon\u2019s political system. Despite this, experts say Hezbollah remains a formidable force in the country, and the challenges Aoun faces in balancing Lebanon's internal politics and foreign relations remain immense.",
      "For much of the past two years, Hezbollah worked tirelessly to block any movement toward the election of a new president. The group had strongly opposed Aoun\u2019s candidacy. However, as the political situation evolved and the ousting of Assad from Syria unfolded, Hezbollah was ultimately forced to accept Aoun, who secured the presidency.",
      "\"Hezbollah had been opposed to his election for the last two and a half years and had blocked any process toward electing a president for all that time. Now, they\u2019ve voted for him in the second round, which indicates they are in a bind, that they are weaker, and their leverage is not what it was,\" Vice President for International Engagement at the Middle East Institute Paul Salem told Fox News Digital.",

      "Salem points to the broader shift in regional politics, notably the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria, which has left Hezbollah increasingly isolated. \"They are now not only cut off from Iran, but they're also isolated in the region. They're the only Shiite community between here and Basra, and it\u2019s a Sunni takeover of Damascus, which used to be dominated by a friendly Alawite, pro-Iranian regime. It\u2019s a huge historic shift that leaves the Shiites and Hezbollah deeply isolated. Hezbollah\u2019s future is worse than its present,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. and Israel, along with other Western and Arab powers, have long sought to distance Lebanon from Hezbollah\u2019s influence, and Aoun\u2019s election could be a step in that direction.",
      "Aoun, a Maronite Christian and the commander of the Lebanese army, took office with a strong message focused on Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty. In his inaugural speech, he emphasized the necessity for the state to have a monopoly on the use of force.",
      "David Schenker, former head of the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department under the first Trump administration, remarked that Aoun\u2019s speech was both a positive and pragmatic step for Lebanon. \"He talked about disarming all groups and ensuring that weapons are under the control of the state,\" Schenker said. \"This was a good move, as it shows a commitment to sovereignty and the rule of law.\"",

      "An updated graphic detailing the members of Hezbollah's leadership who have been eliminated by the Israeli Defense Forces. (IDF Spokesman's Unit)",
      "However, Schenker, who is currently the Taube Senior Fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Linda and Tony Rubin Program on Arab Politics, cautioned that Aoun\u2019s position as president does not grant him absolute power in Lebanon\u2019s political system. \"The president is not the most powerful position in Lebanon. The key position will be the prime minister. It remains to be seen whether Aoun will show the same courage in his new role that he demonstrated as chief of staff,\" Schenker noted.",
      "Though Hezbollah has been militarily weakened by recent Israeli campaigns and the assassination of its leader Hassan Nasrallah, among other key leaders, it still retains significant influence, particularly in southern Lebanon. However, Schenker says the organization\u2019s ability to intimidate Lebanon\u2019s population is diminishing. \"Hezbollah isn\u2019t the force it was. It can still reactivate its killing machine if needed, but it no longer dominates the way it did before,\" he said.",
      "\"Hezbollah has calculated that they\u2019ve lost this battle against Israel, and then they lost another battle in Syria. So their interest now is to lay low, have a president and government that\u2019s acceptable to the U.S. and the region, which, at the end of the day, they hope will protect them from any further Israeli incursions and help their people,\" Salem explained. \"They need a functioning government to secure international aid for the millions displaced by their actions in southern Lebanon. It\u2019s about survival for them, not just politically, but financially.\"",

      "Aoun\u2019s election is not only significant for Hezbollah\u2019s position in Lebanon, but also for the country\u2019s relations with external powers like the U.S. and Israel. Lebanon has faced economic collapse, with its currency devalued by over 99%, and nearly 80% of the population now living below the poverty line. Hezbollah\u2019s previous resistance to international pressure now seems less tenable.",
      "The U.S. has long supported Lebanon\u2019s military and is expected to strengthen its ties with Aoun, given his role in the army and his pro-sovereignty stance. Schenker said that Lebanon\u2019s future alignment with the U.S. and regional allies such as Saudi Arabia could provide the country with much-needed international support.",

      "\"The U.S. military has been close to the Lebanese military for many years,\" Salem told Fox News Digital. \"That has been the strongest link between the U.S. and Lebanon. So to have the head of the military come to power, he\u2019s a known figure in Washington. He\u2019s known to the military, and now, he\u2019s known to the diplomats and politicians, and will be known to President Trump and others over time. This realignment could put Lebanon on a much more natural path of cooperation with the U.S., Saudi Arabia, and other regional allies.\"",
      "Israel will also be closely monitoring Aoun\u2019s presidency. Schenker said that Aoun\u2019s commitment to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for disarmament in southern Lebanon, could lead to a more cooperative stance from Lebanon toward Israel. \"Israel will be invested in Lebanon\u2019s implementation of 1701,\" Schenker said. \"Aoun\u2019s stance will influence Israel\u2019s position toward Lebanon, as the Trump administration has clearly signaled a desire to end the wars in the region.\"",

Her aides later confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner had been detained, and international condemnation immediately poured from leaders in Latin America and beyond demanding her release.",
      "But about an hour later, a 20-second video of Machado was posted online by a Maduro supporter in which the opposition leader said she was followed after leaving the rally and that she had dropped her purse. \"I'm good, I'm safe,\" Machado said in a raspy voice, adding \"Venezuela will be free.\"",

      "Her aides later said in a social media post that the proof-of-of-life video message had been coerced, and that after recording it she was freed. They said she would provide details of her \"kidnapping\" later.",
      "Meanwhile, Maduro supporters denied that she was detained and gloated that government opponents were trying to spread fake news to generate an international crisis. \"Nobody should be surprised,\" Communications Minister Freddy Nanez said. \"Especially since it's coming from the fascists, who were the architects of the dirty trick.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, Machado addressed hundreds of supporters who heeded her call to take to the streets a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly was scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election.",
      "\"They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united, we are not afraid,\" Machado shouted from atop a truck in the capital minutes before she was reported detained.",
      "Machado, 57, is a hardliner former lawmaker who stayed and fought against Maduro even after many of her allies in the opposition leadership fled, joining an exodus of some 7 million Venezuelans who\u2019ve abandoned their homeland in recent years.",
      "Loyalists who control the country's judiciary banned her from running against Maduro last year. In a deft move, she backed an unknown outsider \u2014 retired diplomat Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 who crushed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin, according to voting machine records collected by the opposition and validated by international observers.",

      "\"To the security forces, I warn you: don't play with fire,\" he said in a social media post from the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America.",
      "There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who\u2019ve witnessed Maduro\u2019s security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past.",

      "Those demonstrators that did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado\u2019s call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president.",
      "The deployment of security forces as well as pro-government armed groups known as \"colectivos\" to intimidate opponents betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College.",
      "Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people \u2014 including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners \u2014 who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school.",
      "\"It\u2019s an impressive show of force but it\u2019s also a sign of weakness,\" said Corrales, who co-authored this month an article, \"How Maduro Stole Venezuela\u2019s Vote,\" in the Journal of Democracy.",
      "\"Maduro is safe in office,\" said Corrales, \"but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.\"",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than two-to-one margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate.",
      "The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonz\u00e1lez as Venezuela\u2019s president-elect. Even many of Maduro\u2019s former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday\u2019s swearing-in ceremony.",

    "title": "Panama Canal CEO denies Trump claim that China in control, says end of Carter neutrality treaty means 'chaos'",
    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 13:17:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The Panama Canal Authority leader denied that China controls the waterway, warning President-elect Trump against ending the Neutrality Treaty.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News contributor Joey Jones joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how President-elect Trump has put the world on 'notice' as he eyes the Panama Canal, Greenland and Canada.",
      "The CEO of the Panama Canal has denied President-elect Trump's allegation that the waterway built by the U.S. over a century ago is now under the control of China.",
      "\"The accusations that China is running the Canal are unfounded,\" Panama Canal Authority leader Ricaurte V\u00e1squez Morales told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. \"China has no involvement whatsoever in our operations.\"",
      "\"Rules are rules and there are no exceptions,\" V\u00e1squez Morales reportedly added. \"We cannot discriminate for the Chinese, or the Americans, or anyone else. This will violate the neutrality treaty, international law, and it will lead to chaos.\"",
      "In the 1970s, then-President Jimmy Carter negotiated what became known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which agreed the U.S. could use military force to defend the waterway against any threat to its \"neutrality.\" That aspect was considered crucial for the U.S. at the time amid the threat of Soviet-aligned states. Carter also agreed that the Panama Canal itself would be turned over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.",

      "On Tuesday, a reporter asked Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, if he would assure the world he would not use \"military or economic coercion\" to gain control of the Panama Canal, as well as Greenland.",
      "\"No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But, I can say this. We need them for economic security. The Panama Canal was built for our military,\" Trump said. \"Look, the Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China. And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China. And they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made.\"",
      "While former President Carter was lying in state at the Capitol, Trump said he liked the man but disagreed with the deal he struck regarding the canal.",
      "\"Giving the Panama Canal is why Jimmy Carter lost the election, in my opinion, more so maybe than the hostages. The hostages were a big deal. But if you remember, nobody wants to talk about the Panama Canal because, you know, it's inappropriate, I guess. But, because it's a bad part of the Carter legacy,\" Trump added later. \"But, he was a good man. Look, he was a good man. I know him a little bit, and he was a very fine person. But that was a big mistake.\"",

Among the chilling testimonies, two children revealed they were bound and beaten throughout their captivity, with scars and marks of trauma evident on their bodies. Others reported deliberate burning with heated objects, leaving permanent injuries.",
      "Women detailed horrifying sexual violence, including assaults at gunpoint and forced undressing in front of captors. Men also endured sexual abuse, prolonged starvation, severe beatings, and torture involving branding with hot metal.",

      "Levy expressed deep frustration with the international community, particularly the United Nations, and said he holds little hope for meaningful action after the report. \"For some reason, the Israeli side is not counted as human,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The U.N. ignores the fact that Hamas is committing crimes against humanity.\" Levy represented the hostages\u2019 families in a briefing to the U.N. Security Council last month. \"When I addressed the Security Council, I wanted them to hear a personal story. They need to understand that there cannot be lives that are worth more than others.\"",
      "\"When you see how inhumane and horrible the conditions that the hostages are in, and knowing that my brother is one of them\u2026 it kills me,\" he said. \"Thinking about my brother, who is almost six feet three, trying to stand up in dark, airless tunnels less than six feet tall \u2013 it\u2019s unbearable.\"",

      "Negotiations to free the hostages are ongoing, after President-elect Trump vowed that there would be \"all hell to pay\" if the hostages are not released before he enters office. However, Levy's brother Or is reportedly not \"on the lists\" because he is a young man and therefore not considered a \"humanitarian case.\" Michael explained that his brother has a 3-year-old son who, after losing his mother on Oct. 7, has only his father left. \"If this is not a humanitarian case, I don\u2019t know what is,\" he said.",

Many remain unable to adjust to normal life, haunted by the horrors they endured.",

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 14:16:43 GMT",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump inaccurately blamed water shortages in Los Angeles on policies meant to preserve an endangered fish called the Delta smelt.",
    "story": [
      "According to some politicians and influencers, a small fish called the Delta smelt is to blame for the wildfires that have devastated the Los Angeles area this week.",
      "Prominent figures, including President-elect Donald Trump, said policies related to the endangered Delta smelt affect how much water can be pumped out of the fish\u2019s habitat in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. They added that\u2019s the cause of water supply issues faced by firefighters laboring to stop the blazes. Three water tanks and some fire hydrants temporarily lost water because of high demand Tuesday, local officials said.",
      "The small fish isn\u2019t alone in being the target of blame for the multiple wildfires that had burned across 45 square miles of the city as of Thursday, forcing more than 180,000 people out of their homes. Other people have criticized diversity, equity and inclusion, California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s immigration policies or the influence of billionaires on climate change policy.",
      "It\u2019s not clear what initially sparked the fires, and in the absence of reliable information, some of the allegations being made online are misinformed or wrong, experts say. All of them ignore the complexities that caused the fires to spread and the nuanced solutions that would be required to address similar urban wildfires in the future, they add.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "Trump was among the most notable leaders to call out the Delta smelt, writing Wednesday on Truth Social that Newsom \u201crefused to sign the water restoration declaration\u201d that would have allowed millions of gallons of water to flow into parts of California, \u201cincluding the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wanted to protect an essentially worthless fish called a smelt, by giving it less water (it didn\u2019t work!), but didn\u2019t care about the people of California,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNow the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO CALIFORNIA! He is the blame for this. On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not firefighting planes. A true disaster!\u201d",
      "In a statement in response, Izzy Gardon, Newsom\u2019s director of communications, accused Trump of \u201cplaying politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no such document as the water restoration declaration \u2014 that is pure fiction,\u201d Gardon said Tuesday. \u201cThe Governor is focused on protecting people, not playing politics, and making sure firefighters have all the resources they need.\u201d",
      "Trump wasn\u2019t alone in blaming the Delta smelt. Roger Stone, a Republican operative whom Trump pardoned for multiple felony convictions, shared a photo of the smelt on X on Wednesday, writing, \u201cThis is the fish Gavin Newscum burned California down in order to save.\u201d",
      "James Woods, the actor, who said his home in Pacific Palisades burned down, criticized Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley\u2019s mention of DEI in her bio on the department website.",
      "\u201cRefilling the water reservoirs would have been a welcome priority, too, but I guess she had too much on her plate promoting diversity,\u201d Woods wrote on X next to a photo of the last paragraph of Crowley\u2019s bio. The paragraph says: \u201cCreating, supporting, and promoting a culture that values diversity, inclusion, and equity while striving to meet and exceed the expectations of the communities are Chief Crowley\u2019s priorities, and she is grateful for the opportunity to serve the City of Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "Targeting DEI initiatives after or during attention-grabbing news incidents has become a predictable political tactic in the last year for Republicans, who have responded to everything from bridge collapses to midair accidents with such attacks.",
      "Others have suggested that Newsom also didn\u2019t refill California\u2019s reservoirs or that he returned its water to the ocean.",
      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who owns X, agreed with a post from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that said the fires are part of a \u201clarger globalist plot to wage economic warfare and deindustrialize\u201d the United States before \u201ctriggering total collapse.\u201d",
      "Experts say that most of the takes are inaccurate or miss the point and that they don\u2019t make room for conversations about real solutions to worsening natural disasters.",
      "\u201cI think the blame game isn\u2019t useful,\u201d said Faith Kearns, director of research communications at the Arizona Water Initiative at Arizona State University and co-author of a 2021 report published by UCLA on wildfire and water supply in California.",
      "\u201cThis is a really complex, complicated and emergent issue that just hasn\u2019t been on the radar for mostly anyone, and so I just don\u2019t think that there is individual blame to go around at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThose were exceptional fire conditions that we\u2019re seeing in L.A., drought, climate change and then these high winds.\u201d",
      "Kearns said one of the takeaways of the 2021 report she co-authored was that it\u2019s unclear who would start to address issues with water management related to wildfires. In California, for example, there are thousands of water providers, she said, and some aren\u2019t well-resourced.",
      "\u201cIs it their issue to try to deal with? Is it the fire service? Is it a county, a city?\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that we don\u2019t even know who\u2019s totally responsible for all these things makes me feel like we certainly don\u2019t know where to put blame, either.\u201d",
      "Kearns pointed to a statement from Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who said Wednesday, \u201cWe are fighting a wildfire with urban water systems, and that is really challenging.\u201d",
      "Kearns said that statement highlights a serious issue \u2014 that experts have seen wildland fires move into urban areas only in the last 10 to 15 years and that they\u2019re still figuring out how to address it.",
      "\u201cThe way that firefighting has traditionally been, there are wildland firefighters and agencies, and then there are urban firefighters and agencies,\u201d she said. \u201cAre we having wildland firefighters fighting fires in urban areas or the reverse? And sometimes the approaches are really different.\u201d",
      "The \u201cblame game\u201d ignores the nuances of addressing urban fires, experts said, but it also spreads misinformation.",
      "Caleb Scoville, an assistant professor of sociology at Tufts University who studies the dynamics of environmental controversies, pointed to the California Department of Water Resources website, which shows that most of the state\u2019s major reservoirs are at or above their historic levels for this time of year. He added that that is especially true of reservoirs in Southern California, refuting claims that Newsom or Crowley didn\u2019t refill them.",
      "Scoville added that the Delta smelt, in particular, has repeatedly been blamed by politicians, including Trump, for environmental problems in California. Scoville said the policies that protect the smelt and other species, like salmon, sometimes affect the amount of water that can be pumped at a particular time from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which is the heart of California\u2019s water distribution system, \u201cbut this is not a factor that\u2019s relevant at all to the wildfire situation or the ability of Los Angeles to handle the wildfires.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt plays to a long-standing trope that liberals or people in cities or people in places like California or environmentalists care more about small, uncharismatic species than they care about their fellow Americans,\u201d Scoville said of Trump\u2019s allegations against the smelt, which he called a distraction from the climate crisis and the complexities of water policy in California.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of turning a set of concrete environmental challenges into a kind of culture war,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about dividing people, so it can have sort of short-term political wins, but it\u2019s corrosive to our ability to respond to really serious environmental problems.\u201d"

      "For the Los Angeles area, the recent string of wildfires represents a worst-case scenario \u2014 unusually powerful and prolonged Santa Ana winds struck after months without significant rain. But the steep consequences of the blazes are not a surprise, according to an NBC News review of after-action reports following previous fires, wildfire risk maps, public meetings about wildfire risk and interviews with fire experts.",
      "\u201cEntirely foreseeable,\u201d said Char Miller, a professor of environmental analysis and history at Pomona College.",
      "The fires have forced nearly 180,000 people to evacuate, cut power to nearly half a million customers and burned thousands of homes.",
      "\u201cWe have been building homes deep into the fire zones. We know they\u2019re fire zones, we know they\u2019re dangerous, and yet City Hall and county government has constantly greenlit development in places of greater and greater risks,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAll of the factors you don\u2019t want to see combined combined.\u201d",
      "The risk of wildfire to homes in Los Angeles County is higher than in 99% of counties in the United States, according to a federal analysis. Pacific Palisades, the Hollywood Hills and Altadena, three areas where blazes are burning, have \u201cvery high fire hazard severity,\u201d according to mapping from the the Los Angeles Fire Department and the state.",
      "\u201cIt was not if, it was when\u201d said Joe Scott, the chief fire scientist at Pyrologix, a wildfire risk consultancy that worked on the federal analysis. \u201cBut this is at the high end of what could have happened.\u201d",
      "After the Woolsey Fire in November 2018, an after-action review described problems that resemble those firefighters face today.",
      "That blaze raced across the Santa Monica Mountains toward homes on the Malibu coast, casting embers up to a mile from its front line and forcing 250,000 people to evacuate. More than 1,000 homes in Ventura and Los Angeles counties were destroyed.",
      "The report described it as a \u201cperfect storm.\u201d",
      "The fire\u2019s speed and intensity \u201coverwhelmed the resources on the scene,\u201d it said, noting that dead-end canyon roads made for challenging evacuations and firefighting access. Given the weather and the fire department\u2019s limitations, the review said, the initial response in Malibu and along Pacific Coast Highway had to focus on preserving lives and providing safety \u2014 not protecting property. But the public and policymakers did not fully grasp that reality, it said.",
      "\u201cThe public has a perception that public agencies can always protect them. As an incident the size of the Woolsey Fire shows, this is not always possible,\u201d the report said, lauding first responders for limiting the number of deaths to three.",
      "Even adding more fire engines and taking steps to better prepare homes for potential fires, it concluded, may not be enough to protect new developments in fire-prone areas.",
      "\u201cEven if the current fire weather cycle stops, it will return,\u201d it said.",
      "The predictions were borne out this week: Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday that there simply were not enough firefighters to handle the situation, given the weather conditions.",
      "\u201cL.A. County and all 29 fire departments in our county are not prepared for this type of widespread disaster. There are not enough firefighters in L.A. County to address four separate fires of this magnitude,\u201d Marrone said, noting that firefighters had been pre-positioned in the Santa Monica Mountains ahead of the blazes. \u201cThis is not a normal red flag alert.\u201d",
      "Part of the difficulty of fighting fires in the areas affected by the Woolsey Fire and the current blazes has to do with geography.",
      "Pacific Palisades is a meeting point between suburbs and wildland hillsides often battered by winds. High-end homes \u2014 median values in the ZIP code were over $3.4 million last year, according to data provided by Zillow \u2014\u00a0are nestled into an ecosystem with fire-prone chaparral plants like manzanita, scrub oak and chamise, which is sometimes called greasewood.",
      "Before European settlement, those ecosystems could be expected to burn once every 30 to 130 years. Today, blazes are expected in populated areas every 20 years or less because of ignitions caused by human activity, according to the California Wildfire & Forest Resilience Task Force.",
      "Chaparral ecosystems are known for intense, wind-whipped fires, said Robert Gray, a Canadian wildfire ecologist and former wildland firefighter.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a long list of these chaparral-driven fires, causing immense damage to built-up areas,\u201d Gray said, adding that the plants contain volatile chemicals that can increase the height of flames.",
      "In Los Angeles County, sprawl in the foothills now means that \u201cwhen a fire roars through, as it does, it is leaping from one roof to another,\u201d Miller said.",
      "At the city, county and state levels, California has invested in programs to decrease fire risk and devoted more resources and staffing to fight fires year-round. The Legislature in July extended the peak firefighting staffing season from five to nine months.",
      "The city and county of Los Angeles have implemented brush removal programs designed to ensure homeowners have \u201cdefensible space\u201d\u00a0 for firefighting. Because Pacific Palisades and the Hollywood Hills are in areas considered \u201cVery High Fire Hazard Severity Zones,\u201d homeowners are required to clear brush, trim trees and maintain clean roofs. State code also requires an inspection before a house can be sold.",
      "Those interventions and others, like installing fire-resistant roofs, can work, Gray said \u2014 if everyone in the neighborhood is committed.",
      "\u201cIf your neighbor doesn\u2019t do it and your neighbor\u2019s house catches on fire, the radiant heat alone will negate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Insurers have become increasingly leery given the high risk. In March, State Farm did not renew coverage for about 30,000 property insurance policyholders in California, including more than 1,600 in Pacific Palisades. As of September, more than 1,400 homeowners in Pacific Palisades had policies from California\u2019s FAIR plan, an insurer of last resort.",
      "To that already vulnerable situation, add exceptionally dry conditions \u2014 Los Angeles had not had significant rain since July \u2014\u00a0and a dangerous windstorm. That is the cocktail behind this week\u2019s fires, a confluence of dangers that fire officials had voiced fears about for months.",
      "\u201cRight now, Southern California \u2014 especially that coastal part \u2014 has not received much rain, so it was very vulnerable with those low humidities and fast winds to be receptive to a wildfire,\u201d Anale Burlew, chief deputy of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said at a meeting of California\u2019s wildfire task force after the Franklin Fire scorched more than 4,000 acres near Malibu last month.",
      "Wade Crowfoot, California\u2019s natural resources secretary, said at the meeting that the state\u2019s \u201cfire season has turned into the fire year.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now face wildfire conditions across the state that really never relent through 12 months,\u201d he said.",
      "Winter wildfires in California are often driven by the Santa Ana winds, which sweep down mountain slopes and draw moisture out of coastal areas. The winds can rapidly push any fires that start, particularly when the landscape is dry.",
      "Typically, the San Gabriel Mountains trap high pressure, so the Santa Ana winds are produced as the pressure leaks through canyons and passes. But on Tuesday, the Santa Anas were able to surmount the mountains and send a downslope windstorm toward Pacific Palisades and Pasadena.",
      "\u201cThese are areas that are usually better protected,\u201d said Robert Fovell, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany.",
      "He added that forecasters accurately predicted the wind event: \u201cIt would be fair to characterize this as well-anticipated from a meteorological standpoint.\u201d",
      "Once the Santa Ana winds reach high speeds, options to protect property are limited, said Miller, the Pomona College professor.",
      "\u201cWhen that happens and a fire is ignited, there is no stopping it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s being driven by winds 40, 50, 60, 70 miles an hour, there\u2019s almost nothing that a firefighter can do.\u201d",
      "Research does not suggest that Santa Ana wind events are becoming likelier because of climate change. But rising temperatures and longer droughts mean a higher likelihood of conditions ripe for fire when the winds strike, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA.",
      "\u201cClimate change is increasing the overlap between extremely dry vegetation conditions later in the season and the occurrence of these wind events,\u201d he said in a recent YouTube address.",
      "Swain was the lead author of a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature Reviews, which suggests that \u201chydroclimate whiplash\u201d \u2014 a term for quick swings between intensely wet and dry weather \u2014 has accelerated around the globe. California offers a prime example, since it experienced major flooding during the past two winters.",
      "\u201cThis whiplash sequence in California has increased fire risk twofold,\u201d Swain said in a news release. \u201cFirst, by greatly increasing the growth of flammable grass and brush in the months leading up to fire season, and then by drying it out to exceptionally high levels with the extreme dryness and warmth that followed.\u201d"

    "summary": "Luma Energy, which oversees Puerto Rico's power transmission and distribution system, said the islandwide blackout on New Year's Eve was due to the failure of an underground cable.",
    "story": [
      "Luma Energy, the company in charge of Puerto Rico's power transmission and distribution system, said on Friday that the islandwide blackout on New Year's Eve was due to the failure in an underground cable that had long been out of order.",
      "Juan Rodr\u00edguez, vice president of capital projects at Luma Energy, said that the cable is so old the company that manufactured it closed its doors 25 years ago, Puerto Rican national newspaper El Nuevo D\u00eda reported. He added that they are still investigating how exactly that cable triggered the blackout.",
      "Half of Puerto Rico remained in the dark on New Year's Day, drawing frustration and ire from residents as it coincided with a new increase in the price of electricity attributed to rising fuel costs.",
      "Puerto Ricans, who\u00a0already pay twice as much\u00a0for electricity as those in the U.S. mainland, are now paying more for\u00a0unreliable service provided by an antiquated and patched-up electrical grid.",
      "The grid has not been permanently rebuilt since Hurricane Maria decimated it in 2017. It remains flimsy and prone to breakdowns as outdated fossil fuel plants continue working way past their lifespan to power the grid, and distribution cables fail to transmit electricity. These have caused power outages to become longer and more recurrent.",
      "It took 40 years to build the grid Hurricane Maria destroyed in one day, Sergio Marxuach, policy director of the Puerto Rico-based think tank Center For A New Economy, told NBC News. \"I'm not saying it will take 40 more years to fix it, but the magnitude of the work we have to do is huge.\"",
      "In 2022, exactly five years after Maria, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Fiona. Since then, more than 200 outages have been reported in the U.S. territory due to lack of systems that provide backup energy when the grid fails, according to exiting U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.",
      "\"Band-Aid solutions aren't going to cut it,\" Granholm said in a news conference in Puerto Rico Friday morning. \"Progress is being made and more progress needs to be made.\"",
      "Even though much of the work ahead will fall on the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, Granholm said that under President Joe Biden, \"the ground has been set\" to improve Puerto Rico's grid and transition to renewable energy.",
      "Most of the funds allocated to rebuild the electrical grid, about $17 billion, are coming from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A little over a third of that money, about $6 billion, has been designated to than 200 projects to improve the grid. At least 125 of those are already under construction in partnership with Luma Energy and Genera PR, the private company in charge of power generation, Granholm said.",
      "The secretary said her office assisted Puerto Rico in its race to comply with\u00a0local policies\u00a0that seek to achieve\u00a0100% renewable\u00a0electricity by 2050. Under the Biden administration, Puerto Rico increased its capacity to generate power from renewable energy from less than 4% to 6%.",
      "But great challenges remain ahead as officials in Puerto Rico struggle to simultaneously coordinate short-term repairs to stabilize power services with the grid's long-term reconstruction and a transition to renewable energy sources.",
      "New Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez campaigned on the promise to fix the issue that has been plaguing the U.S. territory. In one of her first acts in office, Gonz\u00e1lez named engineer Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n as the new \u201cenergy czar.\u201d While also serving as director of the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority, Col\u00f3n will serve as the point person in charge of coordinating herculean efforts to improve and rebuild the power grid.",
      "Marxuach, the think tank director, pointed out that it's still unclear what kind of budget and resources will be provided to Col\u00f3n.",
      "Stabilizing the grid and reducing the number of outages in the short-term should still be the top priority, Marxuach said. For this, additional sources of energy need to be added to the grid. Genera PR and Luma Energy plan to install more electric backup units to provide temporary power when the grid fails. They also plan on installing new electrical transformers, as well as repairing several substations in the next 18 months.",
      "Granholm said the Department of Energy \"added 350 megawatts of temporary generation to provide additional backups, but we need to do more.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the grid needs to be fully reconstructed for Puerto Rico to have reliable power in the long term. That process started under Trump's first presidential term. The administration then notoriously blocked Puerto Rico from receiving aid and implemented additional requirements that slowed down the disbursement of reconstruction funds. It remains to be seen if any of these practices will be brought back after Trump takes office for a second time.",
      "A combination of a multitude of factors, Marxuach said, \"have converged so that we will continue, in 2025, to have a system that is still fragile.\""

    "summary": "Bryant was perhaps most well-known for her 1977 \u201cSave Our Children\u201d campaign that painted gays and lesbians as a threat to the country\u2019s youth.",
    "story": [
      "Anita Bryant, a Grammy-nominated singer and former beauty queen who became known for her advocacy against gay rights in the 1970s, died Dec. 16. She was 84.",
      "Bryant died surrounded by family and loved ones at her home in Edmond, Oklahoma, according to an obituary posted Thursday in The Oklahoman, a newspaper in Oklahoma City. She started her promising music career as a child before being crowned Miss Oklahoma at age 18.",
      "As an adult, her career in music blossomed, with Bryant singing at both Democratic and Republican national conventions in 1968 and the Super Bowl in 1971. She sang \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic\u201d at President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s graveside. Bryant again achieved national prominence in the 1970s, serving as the TV spokesperson for Florida orange juice and for Coca-Cola.",
      "Bryant was perhaps most well-known for her advocacy against gay rights in 1977 and foray into Florida politics. Her \u201cSave Our Children\u201d campaign painted gays and lesbians as a threat to the country\u2019s youth. The effort at the time successfully overturned a then-newly passed Miami-Dade County law that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment and public services.",
      "\u201cHomosexuals cannot reproduce, so they must recruit. And to freshen their ranks, they must recruit the youth of America,\u201d Bryant famously declared.",
      "Nearly half a century later, Bryant\u2019s campaign drew parallels to Florida\u2019s Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill by its opponents. The law, which passed in 2022, prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in \u201ckindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\u201d A year later it was expanded to apply through eighth grade.",
      "Bryant\u2019s anti-gay rhetoric ultimately led to the downfall of her promising music and television career. The Florida Citrus Commission stopped running her orange juice ads and she was dropped by her booking agent, forcing her to file for bankruptcy twice. And the antidiscrimination ordinance she helped repeal in 1977 was ultimately restored in 1998.",
      "Bryant\u2019s granddaughter Sarah Green, who married a woman, told Slate in 2021 that she came out to her grandmother on her 21st birthday. Green told Slate that Bryant responded by saying homosexuality isn\u2019t real.",
      "At the end of her life, Bryant led Anita Bryant Ministries International, \u201can organization encouraging others to live with faith and purpose,\u201d Bryant\u2019s obituary reads."

    "summary": "Maduro extends his increasingly repressive rule until 2031 despite protests and credible evidence that his opponent won the election.",
    "story": [
      "CARACAS, Venezuela  \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn in Friday to serve a third six-year term, extending his increasingly repressive rule until 2031 despite protests and credible evidence that his opponent won the election.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by police, military and intelligence officers. Crowds of people, many sporting pro-Maduro T-shirts, gathered in adjacent streets and a nearby plaza.",
      "Maduro accused the opposition of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war,\u201d and said the faction\u2019s failure to stop the inauguration was \u201ca great Venezuelan victory.\u201d He accused external powers of \u201cattacking\u201d Venezuela, specifically the U.S. government, and promised to guarantee \u201cpeace and national sovereignty.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday more than ever I feel the weight of commitment, the power that I represent, the power that the constitution grants me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America.\u201d",
      "The opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines following the July 28 election, posted the tallies online and said they show Gonz\u00e1lez won twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election on the government\u2019s invitation, declared the opposition-published tallies legitimate. Other election experts that the government allowed to witness the vote said polling records posted online by the opposition appear to exhibit all of the original security features.",
      "On Friday, the European Union imposed sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials who had a role in the country\u2019s 2024 election, including the president and vice president of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, the electoral agency and others. The 27-nation bloc said those officials have put the nation\u2019s democracy at risk. The U.S. Treasury Department also slapped a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials, including the president of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, Maduro\u2019s transportation minister and state-owned airline, among others.",
      "On Thursday, as hundreds of anti-Maduro protesters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas, aides to opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she was briefly detained by security forces and coerced into recording videos.",
      "The popular former lawmaker, whom the government has barred from running for office, had emerged from months of hiding to join the rally to demand Gonz\u00e1lez be sworn in instead of Maduro.",
      "Machado addressed the rally then left on a motorcycle with her security convoy. Machado\u2019s press team later announced on social media that security forces \u201cviolently intercepted\u201d her convoy. Her aides confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner was detained.",
      "Leaders in the Americas and Europe condemned the government for suppressing opposition voices and demanded her release. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his support for Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "\u201cThese freedom fighters should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Maduro\u2019s supporters denied that Machado was arrested, saying government opponents were spreading fake news to generate an international crisis.",
      "The brouhaha ahead of Maduro\u2019s inauguration added to the litany of allegations of electoral fraud and brutal repression to silence dissent.",
      "Electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court \u2014 also filled with allies of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela \u2014 to audit the election results. The court reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory without providing thorough evidence and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But neither the council nor the ruling party produced any evidence that Maduro had won, even though their voting center representatives also were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine.",
      "The dispute over the results prompted international outrage and nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary. More than 20 people were killed during the unrest and many protesters reported being tortured in custody.",
      "Outside Friday\u2019s inauguration ceremony, Maduro\u2019s supporters were overjoyed. One of them was Maricarmen Ruiz, 18, who couldn\u2019t hold back her tears.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have words to express my emotion, I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said, expressing relief that opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez wasn\u2019t \u201cimposed\u201d instead as president.",
      "It is unclear how many heads of state attended Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, hosted by the ruling party-controlled National Assembly. Cameras showed Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega and Cuba\u2019s Miguel Diaz-Canel, and Maduro greeted delegates from what he said numbered more than 120 nations.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a close Maduro ally, said he would skip the event citing the detentions earlier in the week of another longtime Venezuelan opposition member and a human rights defender.",
      "Maduro\u2019s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba\u2019s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales. The 2018 election was widely considered a sham after his government banned major opposition parties from participating.",
      "And it remains unclear if Gonz\u00e1lez, who left for exile in Spain in September, will fulfill his promise to return to Venezuela by Friday.",
      "Government officials have repeatedly threatened Gonz\u00e1lez with arrest should he step on Venezuelan soil. On Tuesday, Gonz\u00e1lez said his son-in-law Rafael Tudares had been kidnapped in Caracas. Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s daughter, Mariana Gonz\u00e1lez de Tudares, suggested in a statement that the government was behind her husband\u2019s disappearance.",

      "Haitians who are in the U.S. legally under temporary programs say they are concerned about their ability to remain in the country as President-elect Donald Trump plans to end the programs and carry out mass deportations on Day One of his administration.",
      "Warrens Dolcine, 23, was a political science and international relations student at the Universit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Ha\u00efti, when gang violence began to spread through Port-au-Prince, the capital, and the surrounding area, putting her and her mother in constant peril.",
      "\u201cThe gangs didn\u2019t take over in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was gradual. They worked on your mind first. They started kidnapping people in 2021, and I had to keep leaving my house to stay with my family. Eventually, it wasn\u2019t safe for me or my mom anymore.\u201d",
      "The mother and daughter spent two years shuttling between their home and staying with family members outside of Port-au-Prince. As the violence escalated, they fled Haiti. After a tumultuous escape, Dolcine and her mother came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s Humanitarian Parole Program, which currently creates a legal pathway for temporary visas for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Eligible individuals are granted permission to stay in the country for up to two years, allowing them also work. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including passing security screenings, and are required to have a U.S.-based sponsor. The program, known as the CHNV, aims to address the growing refugee crises in countries like Haiti.",
      "By the end of August 2024, about half a million people from the four countries came to the U.S. under Humanitarian Parole during the Biden administration and 210,000 were Haitian, according to the National Foundation for American Policy.",
      "Sponsored by her great-aunt, Dolcine and her mother entered the U.S. legally in December 2023. She now works full time as an assistant at her church in New York City, while caring for her mother, who is disabled.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump announced plans to launch an unprecedented deportation initiative targeting undocumented criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers. During a NewsNation interview, Trump also mentioned his intention to end programs like Temporary Protected Status, which is set to expire in 2026 and would need to be renewed.\u00a0The program has been adopted by administrations going back to George H.W. Bush.",
      "However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emphasizes that potential beneficiaries of the program undergo rigorous background checks to ensure they pose no security threat to the U.S. Trump\u2019s team did not specifically address the impact of these plans on Haitian migrants when reached by NBC News.",
      "Dolcine said she is determined to stay in the U.S., but is worried about her mother, who depends on her both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIf my mom has a problem, I have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cShe asks, \u2018What will happen to us?\u2019 I don\u2019t have the answers, but I have faith that God will work it out.\u201d",
      "Orilas Jean Francois was also forced to leave Haiti, under extenuating circumstances, he said. Back home he owned construction and finance businesses, which provided a stable life for his family, he said. But in early 2024, Francois started to conceive an escape plan from the violence and economic collapse that define the island nation today.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to leave to find safety and a way to provide for my wife and children.\u201d",
      "Port-au-Prince is facing a surge in violence, with at least 5,600 killings and nearly 1,500 kidnappings reported last year, according to the United Nations. A December massacre in Cit\u00e9 Soleil claimed at least 207 lives, with victims mutilated, burned or dumped at sea by the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie gang.",
      "Political unrest and gang violence delayed his departure from Haiti multiple times, even after he was authorized to enter the U.S. under the Humanitarian Parole Program.",
      "\u201cIn March, I had my ticket and my documents ready to travel, but a massive prison break left the streets unsafe and flights were canceled,\u201d Francois said. His trip was delayed so many times that his initial authorization expired, forcing him to petition USCIS for an extension. \u201cThe stress was unbearable.\u201d",
      "Francois finally arrived in the U.S. in July under the program.After living with his family in New York City for a few months, Francois said he is focused on learning English and finding steady work.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to rely on others for support,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to work, provide for my family and show my gratitude to those who sponsored me.\u201d",
      "Francois and Dolcine both emphasized their commitment to self-sufficiency, pushing back on rhetoric about migrants relying on government aid.",
      "The temporary programs, however, come with issues. Last year, the Humanitarian Parole Program was briefly paused after at least 101,000 applications were filed by so-called serial sponsors, repeatedly using the same contact information and Social Security numbers, according to USCIS.",
      "Nonetheless, Dolcine highlighted the contributions of Haitian migrants in the United States, who are predominantly employed in service-related occupations, with a significant presence in health care support roles. According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 71% of Haitian immigrants aged 16 and older participate in the civilian labor force, compared to 66% of the overall foreign-born population.",
      "\u201cEvery Haitian I know is a skilled worker,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work in the medical field, construction, and other professions. I plan to study nursing while working full-time and helping my mom.\u201d",
      "For Francois, deportation would mean extreme risk. \u201cWe left because we had no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no life in Haiti. If we\u2019re sent back, we\u2019ll be at even greater risk.\u201d",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, which provides help for Haitians locally and in their home country, underscored the emotional toll of living in limbo.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a clear plan is devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need stability to rebuild their lives. At the very least, the government must provide clarity and extend protections for those who have already proven they are contributing to society.\u201d",
      "As Trump threatens to dismantle programs that provide a lifeline for migrants like Dolcine and Francois, they remain steadfast, drawing strength from their faith and dreams. \u201cHe talks a lot,\u201d Dolcine said with a smile, referring to the president-elect. \u201cI\u2019m just going to live in the moment and let things be.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 19:43:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Luma Energy, which oversees Puerto Rico's power transmission and distribution system, said the islandwide blackout on New Year's Eve was due to the failure of an underground cable.",
    "story": [
      "Luma Energy, the company in charge of Puerto Rico's power transmission and distribution system, said on Friday that the islandwide blackout on New Year's Eve was due to the failure in an underground cable that had long been out of order.",
      "Juan Rodr\u00edguez, vice president of capital projects at Luma Energy, said that the cable is so old the company that manufactured it closed its doors 25 years ago, Puerto Rican national newspaper El Nuevo D\u00eda reported. He added that they are still investigating how exactly that cable triggered the blackout.",
      "Half of Puerto Rico remained in the dark on New Year's Day, drawing frustration and ire from residents as it coincided with a new increase in the price of electricity attributed to rising fuel costs.",
      "Puerto Ricans, who\u00a0already pay twice as much\u00a0for electricity as those in the U.S. mainland, are now paying more for\u00a0unreliable service provided by an antiquated and patched-up electrical grid.",
      "The grid has not been permanently rebuilt since Hurricane Maria decimated it in 2017. It remains flimsy and prone to breakdowns as outdated fossil fuel plants continue working way past their lifespan to power the grid, and distribution cables fail to transmit electricity. These have caused power outages to become longer and more recurrent.",
      "It took 40 years to build the grid Hurricane Maria destroyed in one day, Sergio Marxuach, policy director of the Puerto Rico-based think tank Center For A New Economy, told NBC News. \"I'm not saying it will take 40 more years to fix it, but the magnitude of the work we have to do is huge.\"",
      "In 2022, exactly five years after Maria, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Fiona. Since then, more than 200 outages have been reported in the U.S. territory due to lack of systems that provide backup energy when the grid fails, according to exiting U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.",
      "\"Band-Aid solutions aren't going to cut it,\" Granholm said in a news conference in Puerto Rico Friday morning. \"Progress is being made and more progress needs to be made.\"",
      "Even though much of the work ahead will fall on the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, Granholm said that under President Joe Biden, \"the ground has been set\" to improve Puerto Rico's grid and transition to renewable energy.",
      "Most of the funds allocated to rebuild the electrical grid, about $17 billion, are coming from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. A little over a third of that money, about $6 billion, has been designated to than 200 projects to improve the grid. At least 125 of those are already under construction in partnership with Luma Energy and Genera PR, the private company in charge of power generation, Granholm said.",
      "The secretary said her office assisted Puerto Rico in its race to comply with\u00a0local policies\u00a0that seek to achieve\u00a0100% renewable\u00a0electricity by 2050. Under the Biden administration, Puerto Rico increased its capacity to generate power from renewable energy from less than 4% to 6%.",
      "But great challenges remain ahead as officials in Puerto Rico struggle to simultaneously coordinate short-term repairs to stabilize power services with the grid's long-term reconstruction and a transition to renewable energy sources.",
      "New Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez campaigned on the promise to fix the issue that has been plaguing the U.S. territory. In one of her first acts in office, Gonz\u00e1lez named engineer Josu\u00e9 Col\u00f3n as the new \u201cenergy czar.\u201d While also serving as director of the Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority, Col\u00f3n will serve as the point person in charge of coordinating herculean efforts to improve and rebuild the power grid.",
      "Marxuach, the think tank director, pointed out that it's still unclear what kind of budget and resources will be provided to Col\u00f3n.",
      "Stabilizing the grid and reducing the number of outages in the short-term should still be the top priority, Marxuach said. For this, additional sources of energy need to be added to the grid. Genera PR and Luma Energy plan to install more electric backup units to provide temporary power when the grid fails. They also plan on installing new electrical transformers, as well as repairing several substations in the next 18 months.",
      "Granholm said the Department of Energy \"added 350 megawatts of temporary generation to provide additional backups, but we need to do more.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the grid needs to be fully reconstructed for Puerto Rico to have reliable power in the long term. That process started under Trump's first presidential term. The administration then notoriously blocked Puerto Rico from receiving aid and implemented additional requirements that slowed down the disbursement of reconstruction funds. It remains to be seen if any of these practices will be brought back after Trump takes office for a second time.",
      "A combination of a multitude of factors, Marxuach said, \"have converged so that we will continue, in 2025, to have a system that is still fragile.\""

    "story": [
      "The New Orleans Police Department on Friday released body camera footage of the shootout between three officers and the attacker who rammed his truck into pedestrians on Bourbon Street in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day, killing 14 people.",
      "The roughly 10 seconds of footage shows two officers with their guns drawn in front of the open driver\u2019s side door of a white pickup truck. A voice can be heard yelling \u201cput your hands up\u201d before shooting erupts and officers and some pedestrians run away from the vehicle. The police department also released a slower version of the same video, as well as a still image showing what appears to be a muzzle flash from the attacker's weapon.",
      "It was the first time details of the shootout, including the names of the officers who killed the attacker,\u00a0Shamsud-Din Jabbar, were released.",
      "Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick identified the officers who fired on the attacker as Sgt. Nigel Daggs and Officers Christian Beyer and Jacobie Jordan. She called them \u201cnational heroes\u201d and said they \u201cclearly\u201d acted within the law and department policy during the shooting. The bodycam footage is from the camera of another officer, who does not appear to have fired his weapon.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear the officers were well within policy,\u201d she said at a news conference Friday morning. \u201cSo we have no concerns about that.\u201d",
      "Kirkpatrick said that Daggs is a 21-year police veteran. Beyer has been an officer for a year and 11 months, and Jordan for a year and nine months, she said.",
      "A person who answered the phone at a number listed for Daggs directed a reporter to the department\u2019s press office.",
      "Jordan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\u00a0Beyer could not be reached.",
      "Kirkpatrick said that Jordan and a fourth officer, Joseph Rodrigue, a 10-year veteran who did not shoot his firearm, both sustained wounds to their thighs and have since been released from the hospital.",
      "Kirkpatrick could not answer whether the officers may have been struck by friendly fire, saying that was something the FBI will investigate.",
      "This week, Kirkpatrick announced that the department is bringing on William Bratton, who has been the top cop in Boston, New York and Los Angeles, to counsel the city on its security measures after the deadly attack.",
      "Bratton, 77, a veteran of more than 50 years in law enforcement, was brought on as a tactical expert on assessing security in the city after criticism about the security measures in place during the New Year's celebrations.",
      "At a news conference Thursday to formally introduce Bratton in his new position, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said, \u201cThis is moving in the right direction in terms of improving public safety measures in the city of New Orleans as we are preparing to host national events such as the Super Bowl and even Mardi Gras.\u201d",
      "Cantrell said New Orleans was \u201ctaking action to ensure that our city is safe for our residents, our city is safe for our visitors and for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Bratton said that he and his partners will be looking into \u201chow can we identify problems that need to be addressed, new ones that arose out of that event in the area of counterterrorism. The area of terrorism threat is constantly evolving and changing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe idea is a learning experience here, but that learning experience is then focused on prevention, preventing anything like that from happening again,\u201d he said.",
      "The circumstances of the terrorist attack are under investigation. The heavily trafficked thoroughfare of Bourbon Street did not have vehicle security barriers, known as bollards, in place at the time of the attack. The barriers, which at times malfunctioned, had been in use for several years and were removed for replacement ahead of the city\u2019s hosting of the Super Bowl in February. The city also had access to but failed to deploy the 700-pound steel Archer barriers it had previously used to protect crowded streets.",
      "Cantrell and Kirkpatrick have defended the city\u2019s response, saying there were temporary security measures, police vehicles and a large law enforcement presence throughout the French Quarter.",
      "\u201cThis man was going to do his best, and if it hadn\u2019t been on Bourbon, he was going to go somewhere else,\u201d Kirkpatrick said last week."

      "Haitians who are in the U.S. legally under temporary programs say they are concerned about their ability to remain in the country as President-elect Donald Trump plans to end the programs and carry out mass deportations on Day One of his administration.",
      "Warrens Dolcine, 23, was a political science and international relations student at the Universit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Ha\u00efti, when gang violence began to spread through Port-au-Prince, the capital, and the surrounding area, putting her and her mother in constant peril.",
      "\u201cThe gangs didn\u2019t take over in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was gradual. They worked on your mind first. They started kidnapping people in 2021, and I had to keep leaving my house to stay with my family. Eventually, it wasn\u2019t safe for me or my mom anymore.\u201d",
      "The mother and daughter spent two years shuttling between their home and staying with family members outside of Port-au-Prince. As the violence escalated, they fled Haiti. After a tumultuous escape, Dolcine and her mother came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s Humanitarian Parole Program, which currently creates a legal pathway for temporary visas for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Eligible individuals are granted permission to stay in the country for up to two years, allowing them also work. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including passing security screenings, and are required to have a U.S.-based sponsor. The program, known as the CHNV, aims to address the growing refugee crises in countries like Haiti.",
      "By the end of August 2024, about half a million people from the four countries came to the U.S. under Humanitarian Parole during the Biden administration and 210,000 were Haitian, according to the National Foundation for American Policy.",
      "Sponsored by her great-aunt, Dolcine and her mother entered the U.S. legally in December 2023. She now works full time as an assistant at her church in New York City, while caring for her mother, who is disabled.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump announced plans to launch an unprecedented deportation initiative targeting undocumented criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers. During a NewsNation interview, Trump also mentioned his intention to end programs like Temporary Protected Status, which is set to expire in 2026 and would need to be renewed.\u00a0The program has been adopted by administrations going back to George H.W. Bush.",
      "However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emphasizes that potential beneficiaries of the program undergo rigorous background checks to ensure they pose no security threat to the U.S. Trump\u2019s team did not specifically address the impact of these plans on Haitian migrants when reached by NBC News.",
      "Dolcine said she is determined to stay in the U.S., but is worried about her mother, who depends on her both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIf my mom has a problem, I have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cShe asks, \u2018What will happen to us?\u2019 I don\u2019t have the answers, but I have faith that God will work it out.\u201d",
      "Orilas Jean Francois was also forced to leave Haiti, under extenuating circumstances, he said. Back home he owned construction and finance businesses, which provided a stable life for his family, he said. But in early 2024, Francois started to conceive an escape plan from the violence and economic collapse that define the island nation today.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to leave to find safety and a way to provide for my wife and children.\u201d",
      "Port-au-Prince is facing a surge in violence, with at least 5,600 killings and nearly 1,500 kidnappings reported last year, according to the United Nations. A December massacre in Cit\u00e9 Soleil claimed at least 207 lives, with victims mutilated, burned or dumped at sea by the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie gang.",
      "Political unrest and gang violence delayed his departure from Haiti multiple times, even after he was authorized to enter the U.S. under the Humanitarian Parole Program.",
      "\u201cIn March, I had my ticket and my documents ready to travel, but a massive prison break left the streets unsafe and flights were canceled,\u201d Francois said. His trip was delayed so many times that his initial authorization expired, forcing him to petition USCIS for an extension. \u201cThe stress was unbearable.\u201d",
      "Francois finally arrived in the U.S. in July under the program.After living with his family in New York City for a few months, Francois said he is focused on learning English and finding steady work.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to rely on others for support,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to work, provide for my family and show my gratitude to those who sponsored me.\u201d",
      "Francois and Dolcine both emphasized their commitment to self-sufficiency, pushing back on rhetoric about migrants relying on government aid.",
      "The temporary programs, however, come with issues. Last year, the Humanitarian Parole Program was briefly paused after at least 101,000 applications were filed by so-called serial sponsors, repeatedly using the same contact information and Social Security numbers, according to USCIS.",
      "Nonetheless, Dolcine highlighted the contributions of Haitian migrants in the United States, who are predominantly employed in service-related occupations, with a significant presence in health care support roles. According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 71% of Haitian immigrants aged 16 and older participate in the civilian labor force, compared to 66% of the overall foreign-born population.",
      "\u201cEvery Haitian I know is a skilled worker,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work in the medical field, construction, and other professions. I plan to study nursing while working full-time and helping my mom.\u201d",
      "For Francois, deportation would mean extreme risk. \u201cWe left because we had no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no life in Haiti. If we\u2019re sent back, we\u2019ll be at even greater risk.\u201d",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, which provides help for Haitians locally and in their home country, underscored the emotional toll of living in limbo.",
      "\u201cThe lack of a clear plan is devastating,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople need stability to rebuild their lives. At the very least, the government must provide clarity and extend protections for those who have already proven they are contributing to society.\u201d",
      "As Trump threatens to dismantle programs that provide a lifeline for migrants like Dolcine and Francois, they remain steadfast, drawing strength from their faith and dreams. \u201cHe talks a lot,\u201d Dolcine said with a smile, referring to the president-elect. \u201cI\u2019m just going to live in the moment and let things be.\u201d"

      "\u201cWith your voice and that monkey, I\u2019m going to see you and relate to you in a way that is going to be more engaging than yet another musical biopic,\u201d Gracey added.",

      "On Jan. 10, her last day on TODAY, Hoda thanked her fans and looked back at her NBC News career in a letter that she also called a \"thank you note.\"",
      "\"To our viewers, who have been my extended TV family for the last 16 years here on the fourth hour of TODAY, this is a letter for you,\" she said on TODAY with Hoda & Jenna, which will be called TODAY with Jenna & Friends after Hoda's departure.",
      "\"This is not a goodbye letter. This is a love letter, a love letter to you. It\u2019s actually kind of a thank you note as well. So how do I say it? How do I say thank you for more hugs and more love than one person deserves?\" she said.",
      "Hoda then recalled co-hosting the fourth hour of TODAY alongside Kathie Lee Gifford from 2008 to 2019.",
      "\"Sixteen years ago, I sat next to Kathie Lee, and she changed my life,\" Hoda said. \"She chose me. And truth be told, I was scared. I had never done anything like this before. I was a hard-news person, a 'Dateline' person, and then one day she called me 'Hoda Woman.' I ripped off that news corset. We poured ourselves a glass of wine. And so it began.",
      "\"It went from 'Hoda Woman' to 'Hoda Mama' when Haley was born. I held Haley, and you held me. You supported me, the cards, the comments, the letters, I read them all, and then Hopey came too,\" she added of her two kids, Haley, 8, and Hope, 5.",
      "While recalling her \"new era\" with Jenna Bush Hager, Hoda said they had \"six unforgettable years\" together with \"uncontrollable laughter and pure friendship.\"",
      "\"I can hardly even say her name without laughing out loud. But that is not the part I fell in love with. I fell in love with her tears, her vulnerable, lovable self, and as I say in my cards to her, you\u2019re all mine and we\u2019re all ours,\" she said.",
      "Hoda ended her letter by recalling her 60th birthday celebration. When she announced her TODAY exit in September, Hoda said that turning 60 was a pivotal moment in her life because that was when she knew it was time for her to \"try something new.\"",
      "\"When I turned 60, you threw me one hell of a party. I reached the mountaintop so high on that day, I knew in that very moment there was no greater peak,\" she said in her letter. \u201cAnd along the way, you invited me into your lives, your triumphs, your special moments and your celebrations. Having a front-row seat to all of this truly helped shape who I am. Thank you so much for letting me be part of your journey.",
      "\"I have become who I am on this hour of this show, and you are there with me every step of the way. So as I sit here today in my final moments, on this final day in this chapter of my career, I want to say thank you from the bottom of my very full heart for the ride of a lifetime. I love you.\"",
      "Earlier in the episode, Jenna read aloud a letter that she prepared for Hoda as part of her co-host's last day at TODAY. In the letter, Jenna thanked Hoda for everything she's learned from her.",
      "\"You have taught me to\u00a0really look\u00a0into the eyes and the hearts of our guests and listen, how to really listen!\" she said. \"And now, my dearest, you are teaching us the most important lesson of all: how to say goodbye with grace.\"",
      "\"Thank you, Hoda, for everything you have taught me, everything you\u2019ve given me: all the hugs, all the heart, all the laughs, all the love. I will miss you, my friend, but I love you and I am so proud,\" Jenna concluded. \"Love always and forever, Jenna.\"",
      "In September, Hoda announced that\u00a0she would be leaving TODAY\u00a0after spending 26 years\u00a0at NBC News. Hoda explained that she felt it was time for her to spend more time with her daughters.",
      "\u201cObviously I had my kiddos late in life, and I was thinking that they deserve a bigger piece of my time pie that I have,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like we only have a finite amount of time.\u201d",

      "The 36-year-old mother of three told People that she and a friend were picking out Boss' outfit for his funeral when they found a \"cornucopia\" of drugs, including \"substances I had to look up on my phone,\" hidden in shoeboxes.",
      "\u201cIt was a\u00a0really triggering moment\u00a0for me because there were a lot of things I discovered in our closet that I did not know existed. It was very alarming to me to learn that there was so much happening that I had no clue (about),\u201d she told the outlet.",
      "Holker explained that while it was a \"really scary moment in my life,\" the discovery also led her to \"process what he was going through\" at that time.",
      "\u201cHe was hiding so much, and there must have been a lot of shame in that,\u201d she added.",
      "Boss' mother, Connie Boss Alexander, seemingly responded to Holker's statements about the drugs in an Instagram post shared Jan. 9.",
      "\"Our family is absolutely appalled by the misleading and hurtful claims made about my son, Stephen Boss. The recent publications spreading untruths about Stephen have crossed every line of decency,\" she wrote. \"As his mother, I will not let these accusations go unanswered. We will not stand by while his name and legacy are tarnished. He doesn\u2019t deserve this, and the kids don\u2019t deserve this.\"",
      "\"For the last two years, I have remained quiet and away from the public eye to protect my family. My primary focus has been on healing\u00a0and attempting to remain connected to my grandchildren. But when I read these dreadful claims about my baby, our beloved Stephen, I realized I could not stay silent any longer. Our family will ensure his name and memory are protected, and we are committed to defending his honor.\"",

      "\u201cThat was his alone time. It was his time to recharge, and that was OK,\u201d she said in the interview.",
      "\u201cHe was wrestling with a lot inside himself, and he was trying to self-medicate and cope with all those feelings because he didn\u2019t want to put it on anyone because he loved everyone so much,\u201d Holker continued. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want other people to take on his pain.\u201d",
      "Holker explained that she gained more clarity from reading Boss\u2019 journal entries after his death, which gave her a \u201cbetter perspective of where he was in life and the type of things he was struggling with.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt did have me feel a lot of empathy towards him and sadness for all the pain that he was holding,\u201d she said.",
      "At the time, Holker said she thought of Boss as two separate people: an exceptional performer on \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\u201d and who he was when relaxed at home.",
      "\u201cWhen I would think about my husband at the time, I would think, \u2018Oh, I love that tWitch is such a great performer, but then when he comes home he feels safe enough to be Stephen,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI was with him for so long, and that\u2019s how he\u2019s been the entire relationship. I was like, \u2018It\u2019s a beautiful thing that he can be both.\u2019\u201d",
      "Not until after his death did Holker explain that she now views the \u201ctwo very different personalities\u201d as \u201cbattling\u201d each other.",
      "\u201cWhat if he felt safe being this one individual that has different kind of energies,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a completely different person and put them aside from each other.\u201d",
      "Holker shared children Weslie, 16, Maddox, 8, and Zaia, 5, with Boss.",
      "Since her former husband's death just over two years ago, Holker has been open about sharing her experience as dealing with loss as a now-single mother.",
      "In March 2024, Holker explained that she felt comfortable about expressing her own emotions around her journey with grief because she saw her kids \u201crediscover joy.\u201d",
      "In an essay for \u201cGlamour,\u201d Holker revealed two affirmations that she continues to tell her kids \u201cevery single day\u201d: \u201cI\u2019ll always show up,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m capable of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI also tell myself that every season \u2014 whether it\u2019s good or bad \u2014 has an expiration date,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cAnd if you can just get past those hard moments, you\u2019ll find yourself.\u201d"

      "What happened in Part 1 of the crossover?",
      "According to a description of the episode, Ava (Janelle James) \"announces the school district is sending a group of volunteers to help out at Abbott.\" Unfortunately, \"things don't go as planned\" when they arrive.",

      "\u201cI think just by nature of the schedule. In some ways, you look at the \u2018Abbott\u2019 episode, and it stands on its own, and it\u2019s so great, and it\u2019s a fully realized story,\" McElhenney said.",

    "story": [
      "When Zendaya walked the Golden Globes red carpet on Jan. 5, it wasn\u2019t her and long-time stylist Law Roach\u2019s ability to perfect a look that caught people\u2019s attention.",
      "It was the diamond rock perched on her left ring finger.",
      "Fans began speculating Zendaya was wearing an engagement ring, indicating she and Tom Holland had decided to take the next step in their relationship.",
      "TMZ and People reported the engagement on Jan. 6, citing sources close to the couple. TODAY.com has reached out to Zendaya and Holland for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Zendaya is keeping mum \u2014 but her ring tells a story, jewelry experts say.",
      "Laura Taylor, an engagement ring specialist at the U.K. based jewelry brand Lorel Diamonds, estimates the diamond in Zendaya\u2019s ring comes in at about five carats. The stone has a horizontal, or \u201ceast-west,\u201d orientation and is set a Georgian-style cut-down, also called a button-back setting. The ring is two-tone, featuring both gold and silver-hued metals.",
      "The effect, Taylor says, is the perfect example of \u201cOld Hollywood glamour with a modern twist.\u201d The cushion-cut diamond and the button-back setting give the ring vintage familiarity, whereas the east-west orientation and mixed metals make it feel edgy.",
      "Typically found in antiques, the button-back setting is unique because the jewel is fully encircled with metal and prongs (in this case, six), allowing it to sit lower on the band. Taylor calls the low setting a \u201cpractical\u201d choice with an heirloom feel.",
      "The east-west orientation, an alternative to the more typical vertical style, also gives the ring an edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle yet confident way to say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this our way,\u2019\u201d Taylor says.",
      "The east-west orientation also symbolizes \u201cequal partnership and commitment,\u201d Julia Briggs Parsons, founder and CEO of luxury jewelry brand Incredible Rising, says.",
      "Jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 believes the ring was designed by Jessica McCormack. TODAY.com has reached out to the jeweler for comment. \u201cShe\u2019s giving quiet luxury \u2014 Jessica McCormack is very, \u2018If you know, you know,\u2019\u201d Chaf\u00e9 says.",
      "Based on the brand and the size of the stone, Chaf\u00e9 estimates the ring cost over $200,000.",
      "Initially, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised the ring was not designed by Bulgari, as Zendaya is an ambassador for the luxury brand. In fact, Zendaya and Bulgari\u2019s long relationship was a clue into the engagement. At the Golden Globes, Bulgari took credit for all of Zendaya\u2019s jewelry \u2014 except the ring on her left hand.",
      "The seemingly deliberate choice by the couple makes the ring all the more personal. \u201cThis engagement ring looks like it\u2019s been handed down through generations of love stories,\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Uniquely theirs, jewelers also predict features in Zendaya's ring, like the button-back setting and east-west orientation, will rise in popularity, just like Selena Gomez's recent engagement ring may do for marquise cuts.",

      "The \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d star recently spoke to People about living separately from her husband, who lives on the East Coast as a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania State Senate. Ralph lives thousands of miles away on the West Coast, where her hit comedy is partly filmed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very fortunate. The man that I am married to is Senator Vincent Hughes, seventh Senatorial district of Pennsylvania,\u201d she told the publication.",
      "She continued, \u201cYou fall in love with somebody and you realize he\u2019s not leaving his career. He\u2019s not leaving Philadelphia. I\u2019m not leaving Hollywood. When you have children, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d",

      "Ralph went on to explain the benefit of having two homes. She added, \u201cHe has his own life. I have my own life. He has his own real career, I have my own real career. He has his light to stand in, I have my light to stand in. He is not looking at me thinking about status or this or that. He\u2019s doing his thing. I get to do my thing.\u201d",
      "Even though the two don\u2019t live together, they still make sure to communicate and tackle any problems that arise.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve evolved into (saying), \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it.\u2019 If you sit in problems, you get anxious, depressed, and all the juiciness in life starts to dry up,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t have that, because all of that will mess with my good looks!\u201d",

How does that work?\u2019\u201d Ralph recalled. \u201cI say, \u2018Dolly Parton knows how it works.\u2019 She\u2019s been married for 50 years. You have never seen her husband one time. You know why? Because they plan on staying married.\u201d",

      "The project comprises the Dutch National Archives; the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies; the WO2Net Foundation; and the Huygens Institute \u2014\u00a0which implements AI-software that makes typed, printed and handwritten documents text searchable.",
      "The online archive is \u201can extraordinary resource, and one that is very timely in terms of the Dutch debates about World War II and levels of collaboration,\u201d said Dan Stone, a professor of modern history at Royal Holloway, University of London.",
      "\u201cAt the very least, it shows that huge numbers of people were accused of collaborating with the Nazi occupier,\u201d Stone told NBC News by email. \u201cAnd the fact that relatively few were imprisoned probably tells us as much about postwar Dutch society as it does about the wartime facts.\u201d",
      "Of those in the database, only a fifth ever appeared in court, with most cases concerning more minor offenses such as membership in the Nazi party, Reuters reported. According to the Dutch central statistics bureau, in 1939 \u2014 the year World War II broke out \u2014 the country\u2019s population was 8.7 million. That would make just under 5% of the country suspected collaborators.",
      "Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940 and occupied the country until the allied liberation in 1945.",
      "During that period, more than 100,000 Dutch Jews \u2014 around three-quarters of those in the country \u2014 were killed in the Holocaust, with approximately 6 million Jews murdered overall alongside the Nazis\u2019 political opponents and members of other groups declared to be inferior, such as Roma and LGBTQ people."

      "Haitians who are in the U.S. legally under temporary programs say they are concerned about their ability to remain in the country as President-elect Donald Trump plans to end the programs and carry out mass deportations on Day One of his administration.",
      "Warrens Dolcine, 23, was a political science and international relations student at the Universit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019Ha\u00efti, when gang violence began to spread through Port-au-Prince, the capital, and the surrounding area, putting her and her mother in constant peril.",
      "\u201cThe gangs didn\u2019t take over in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was gradual. They worked on your mind first. They started kidnapping people in 2021, and I had to keep leaving my house to stay with my family. Eventually, it wasn\u2019t safe for me or my mom anymore.\u201d",
      "The mother and daughter spent two years shuttling between their home and staying with family members outside of Port-au-Prince. As the violence escalated, they fled Haiti. After a tumultuous escape, Dolcine and her mother came to the United States under the Biden administration\u2019s Humanitarian Parole Program, which currently creates a legal pathway for temporary visas for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.",
      "Eligible individuals are granted permission to stay in the country for up to two years, allowing them also work. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including passing security screenings, and are required to have a U.S.-based sponsor. The program, known as the CHNV, aims to address the growing refugee crises in countries like Haiti.",
      "By the end of August 2024, about half a million people from the four countries came to the U.S. under Humanitarian Parole during the Biden administration and 210,000 were Haitian, according to the National Foundation for American Policy.",
      "Sponsored by her great-aunt, Dolcine and her mother entered the U.S. legally in December 2023. She now works full time as an assistant at her church in New York City, while caring for her mother, who is disabled.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump announced plans to launch an unprecedented deportation initiative targeting undocumented criminals, drug traffickers and human traffickers. During a NewsNation interview, Trump also mentioned his intention to end programs like Temporary Protected Status, which is set to expire in 2026 and would need to be renewed.\u00a0The program has been adopted by administrations going back to George H.W. Bush.",
      "However, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services emphasizes that potential beneficiaries of the program undergo rigorous background checks to ensure they pose no security threat to the U.S. Trump\u2019s team did not specifically address the impact of these plans on Haitian migrants when reached by NBC News.",
      "Dolcine said she is determined to stay in the U.S., but is worried about her mother, who depends on her both financially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cIf my mom has a problem, I have a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cShe asks, \u2018What will happen to us?\u2019 I don\u2019t have the answers, but I have faith that God will work it out.\u201d",
      "Orilas Jean Francois was also forced to leave Haiti, under extenuating circumstances, he said. Back home he owned construction and finance businesses, which provided a stable life for his family, he said. But in early 2024, Francois started to conceive an escape plan from the violence and economic collapse that define the island nation today.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a choice I made lightly,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to leave to find safety and a way to provide for my wife and children.\u201d",
      "Port-au-Prince is facing a surge in violence, with at least 5,600 killings and nearly 1,500 kidnappings reported last year, according to the United Nations. A December massacre in Cit\u00e9 Soleil claimed at least 207 lives, with victims mutilated, burned or dumped at sea by the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie gang.",
      "Political unrest and gang violence delayed his departure from Haiti multiple times, even after he was authorized to enter the U.S. under the Humanitarian Parole Program.",
      "\u201cIn March, I had my ticket and my documents ready to travel, but a massive prison break left the streets unsafe and flights were canceled,\u201d Francois said. His trip was delayed so many times that his initial authorization expired, forcing him to petition USCIS for an extension. \u201cThe stress was unbearable.\u201d",
      "Francois finally arrived in the U.S. in July under the program.After living with his family in New York City for a few months, Francois said he is focused on learning English and finding steady work.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to rely on others for support,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to work, provide for my family and show my gratitude to those who sponsored me.\u201d",
      "Francois and Dolcine both emphasized their commitment to self-sufficiency, pushing back on rhetoric about migrants relying on government aid.",
      "The temporary programs, however, come with issues. Last year, the Humanitarian Parole Program was briefly paused after at least 101,000 applications were filed by so-called serial sponsors, repeatedly using the same contact information and Social Security numbers, according to USCIS.",
      "Nonetheless, Dolcine highlighted the contributions of Haitian migrants in the United States, who are predominantly employed in service-related occupations, with a significant presence in health care support roles. According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, 71% of Haitian immigrants aged 16 and older participate in the civilian labor force, compared to 66% of the overall foreign-born population.",

      "For Francois, deportation would mean extreme risk. \u201cWe left because we had no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no life in Haiti. If we\u2019re sent back, we\u2019ll be at even greater risk.\u201d",
      "Yolette Williams, CEO of the Haitian American Alliance of New York, which provides help for Haitians locally and in their home country, underscored the emotional toll of living in limbo.",

      "As Trump threatens to dismantle programs that provide a lifeline for migrants like Dolcine and Francois, they remain steadfast, drawing strength from their faith and dreams. \u201cHe talks a lot,\u201d Dolcine said with a smile, referring to the president-elect. \u201cI\u2019m just going to live in the moment and let things be.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "CARACAS, Venezuela  \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was sworn in Friday to serve a third six-year term, extending his increasingly repressive rule until 2031 despite protests and credible evidence that his opponent won the election.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislative palace, where he was sworn in and delivered a fiery speech, was heavily guarded by police, military and intelligence officers. Crowds of people, many sporting pro-Maduro T-shirts, gathered in adjacent streets and a nearby plaza.",
      "Maduro accused the opposition of trying to turn his inauguration into a \u201cworld war,\u201d and said the faction\u2019s failure to stop the inauguration was \u201ca great Venezuelan victory.\u201d He accused external powers of \u201cattacking\u201d Venezuela, specifically the U.S. government, and promised to guarantee \u201cpeace and national sovereignty.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday more than ever I feel the weight of commitment, the power that I represent, the power that the constitution grants me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not been made president by the government of the United States, nor by the pro-imperialist governments of Latin America.\u201d",
      "The opposition collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines following the July 28 election, posted the tallies online and said they show Gonz\u00e1lez won twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, which observed the election on the government\u2019s invitation, declared the opposition-published tallies legitimate. Other election experts that the government allowed to witness the vote said polling records posted online by the opposition appear to exhibit all of the original security features.",
      "On Friday, the European Union imposed sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials who had a role in the country\u2019s 2024 election, including the president and vice president of Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, the electoral agency and others. The 27-nation bloc said those officials have put the nation\u2019s democracy at risk. The U.S. Treasury Department also slapped a new round of sanctions on Venezuelan officials, including the president of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, Maduro\u2019s transportation minister and state-owned airline, among others.",
      "On Thursday, as hundreds of anti-Maduro protesters took to the streets of the capital, Caracas, aides to opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado said she was briefly detained by security forces and coerced into recording videos.",
      "The popular former lawmaker, whom the government has barred from running for office, had emerged from months of hiding to join the rally to demand Gonz\u00e1lez be sworn in instead of Maduro.",
      "Machado addressed the rally then left on a motorcycle with her security convoy. Machado\u2019s press team later announced on social media that security forces \u201cviolently intercepted\u201d her convoy. Her aides confirmed to The Associated Press that the opposition hardliner was detained.",
      "Leaders in the Americas and Europe condemned the government for suppressing opposition voices and demanded her release. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump expressed his support for Machado and Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "\u201cThese freedom fighters should not be harmed, and MUST stay SAFE and ALIVE!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Maduro\u2019s supporters denied that Machado was arrested, saying government opponents were spreading fake news to generate an international crisis.",
      "The brouhaha ahead of Maduro\u2019s inauguration added to the litany of allegations of electoral fraud and brutal repression to silence dissent.",
      "Electoral authorities loyal to the ruling party declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28, but unlike in previous presidential elections, they did not provide detailed vote counts.",
      "Global condemnation over the lack of transparency prompted Maduro to ask the country\u2019s high court \u2014 also filled with allies of his United Socialist Party of Venezuela \u2014 to audit the election results. The court reaffirmed Maduro\u2019s victory without providing thorough evidence and encouraged the electoral council to release the vote counts. But neither the council nor the ruling party produced any evidence that Maduro had won, even though their voting center representatives also were entitled to tally sheets from every voting machine.",
      "The dispute over the results prompted international outrage and nationwide protests. The government responded with full force, arresting more than 2,000 demonstrators and encouraging Venezuelans to report anyone they suspect to be a ruling-party adversary. More than 20 people were killed during the unrest and many protesters reported being tortured in custody.",
      "Outside Friday\u2019s inauguration ceremony, Maduro\u2019s supporters were overjoyed. One of them was Maricarmen Ruiz, 18, who couldn\u2019t hold back her tears.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have words to express my emotion, I\u2019m happy,\u201d she said, expressing relief that opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez wasn\u2019t \u201cimposed\u201d instead as president.",
      "It is unclear how many heads of state attended Maduro\u2019s swearing-in, hosted by the ruling party-controlled National Assembly. Cameras showed Nicaragua\u2019s Daniel Ortega and Cuba\u2019s Miguel Diaz-Canel, and Maduro greeted delegates from what he said numbered more than 120 nations.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro, a close Maduro ally, said he would skip the event citing the detentions earlier in the week of another longtime Venezuelan opposition member and a human rights defender.",
      "Maduro\u2019s last inauguration, in 2019, was attended by Cuba\u2019s President Miguel Diaz-Canel and then-Bolivian President Evo Morales. The 2018 election was widely considered a sham after his government banned major opposition parties from participating.",
      "And it remains unclear if Gonz\u00e1lez, who left for exile in Spain in September, will fulfill his promise to return to Venezuela by Friday.",
      "Government officials have repeatedly threatened Gonz\u00e1lez with arrest should he step on Venezuelan soil. On Tuesday, Gonz\u00e1lez said his son-in-law Rafael Tudares had been kidnapped in Caracas.

Trump said he is keeping the option of using the military to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal on the table while saying he will exert \u201ceconomic force\u201d to pressure Canada to join the United States. He has also said he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico and Denali, North America\u2019s tallest peak.",

Democrats and Republicans who spoke to NBC News, including close Trump allies, said some of his recent demands are serious and some are ways to gain leverage for other parts of his agenda, while others are just trolling.",
      "Greenland is an island Trump very much desires. A person familiar with the discussions said Trump has never given up on acquiring Greenland, which he tried to purchase during his first term for defense reasons and was rebuffed.",

On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., took a trip to Nuuk, the largest population center on the island of about 57,000 people, and the president-elect called in to deliver a message to Greenlanders.",

But John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser who has since broken with him, told NBC News in an interview that while he served under Trump he didn\u2019t hear any talk of acquiring the Panama Canal (or making Canada the 51st state). The person familiar also said reclaiming the canal was not a focus during Trump\u2019s first term in office.",

The second person familiar with the discussions said Trump\u2019s threat to take the canal is \u201ca negotiating tool\u201d to get Panama to get more favorable treatment for U.S. shipments.",

Last month, Canadian officials announced a plan to increase spending on border security, which was a focus of the Republican presidential primary campaign last year.",

Feeley, who was the U.S. ambassador to Panama under President Barack Obama and Trump before he resigned over policy disagreements with Trump, said Trump\u2019s public push will put incoming ambassadors behind the eight ball.",
      "\u201cIf Trump attempts to operationalize the threats made to Panama, Canada and Greenland \u2026 it\u2019s going to put any ambassador in the most difficult position I can conceive of: telling a treaty ally your boss plans to take their sovereign homeland,\u201d Feeley said.",
      "Countering China's influence",
      "Trump and his allies have pointed to national security as the rationale for why the U.S. should acquire Greenland, with Trump posting on his Truth Social platform last month that American \u201cownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\u201d The island, which has been under Denmark\u2019s control since the 14th century, was fully integrated into Denmark in 1953 under the country\u2019s constitution, and it became a self-governing territory in 1979. Greenlanders have full citizenship in Denmark.",
      "Greenland is closer to New York than Copenhagen, and the United States briefly occupied it during World War II. It is home to a large U.S. Air Force base and major mineral reserves. In recent years, China has sought to make inroads on the island.",
      "Carla Sands, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to Denmark, said the Danes simply do not have the capacity to properly defend the island, while China\u2019s attempts to boost ties with Greenland have had American officials on high alert.",
      "\u201cWe are great partners and allies with Denmark,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had diplomatic relations with them for 200 years. They\u2019re founding members of NATO. So we\u2019re good friends, but good friends sometimes have to have tough conversations. And one of the conversations was, \u2018How are you going to defend Greenland, part of your kingdom, when you can\u2019t even defend Denmark proper?\u2019\"",
      "\u201cThe only capabilities that Denmark controls for Greenland are defense and foreign policy; everything else Greenland controls,\u201d Sands added. \u201cAnd that makes Greenland really, really vulnerable to bad actors, because they want economic growth.\u201d",
      "But Rufus Gifford, the ambassador to Denmark in the Obama administration and finance chair of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 campaign, said gaining Greenland would not be anywhere near as simple as Trump may make it seem.For starters, Gifford said, \u201cany Danish prime minister that loses Greenland in this day and age would be the laughingstock of the country, and would be forever.\u201d And, he added, Greenlanders may not want to give up their \u201cfairly privileged place in Danish society.\u201d",
      "As far as national security concerns go, Gifford said any military incursion into Greenland would invoke NATO\u2019s Article Five, which requires the alliance\u2019s members to defend it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly concern about Chinese influence in Greenland, and there should be,\u201d he said, adding, though, \u201cthe only reason why you would say that, for national security reasons, Greenland needs to be American would be if you\u2019re threatening to pull out of NATO. And that part is all the scarier.\u201d",
      "When it comes to the Panama Canal, Trump has framed his own focus on U.S. ships being \u201covercharged\u201d to use the waterway, as he said Tuesday, while he believes Chinese ships are getting preferential treatment. Trump also said he long believed Carter was mistaken to have negotiated treaties that turned over control of the canal to Panama.",

      "The presidency, reserved for a Maronite Christian in Lebanon\u2019s sectarian power-sharing system, has been vacant since Michel Aoun\u2019s term ended in October 2022, with deeply divided factions unable to agree on a candidate able to win enough votes in the 128-seat parliament.",
      "Aoun fell short of the 86 votes needed in a first round vote, but crossed the threshold with 99 votes in a second round, according to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, after lawmakers from Hezbollah and its Shi\u2019ite ally the Amal Movement backed him.",
      "Momentum built behind Aoun on Wednesday as Hezbollah\u2019s long preferred candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, withdrew and declared support for the army commander, and as French and Saudi envoys shuttled around Beirut, urging his election in meetings with politicians, three Lebanese political sources said.",
      "\u201cThere is a very clear message from the international community that they are ready to support Lebanon, but that needs a president, a government,\u201d Michel Mouawad, a Christian lawmaker opposed to Hezbollah who voted for Aoun, told Reuters before the vote. \u201cWe did get a message from Saudi of support,\u201d he added.",

      "Lebanon, its economy still reeling from a devastating\u00a0financial collapse\u00a0in 2019, is in dire need of international support to rebuild from the war, which the World Bank estimates cost the country $8.5 billion.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s system of government requires the new president to convene consultations with lawmakers to nominate a Sunni Muslim prime minister to form a new cabinet, a process that can often be protracted as factions barter over ministerial portfolios.",
      "Aoun has a key role in shoring up a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0between Hezbollah and Israel which was brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces.",
      "He told lawmakers on Thursday that he will work to ensure the state has the exclusive right to carry arms, in his first speech at parliament after he was elected.",
      "His comments were seen partly as a reference to Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal, which he had not commented on publicly as the former army commander.",
      "Aoun, 60, has been commander of the U.S.-backed Lebanese army since 2017. On his watch, U.S. aid continued to flow to the army, part of a long-standing U.S. policy focused on supporting state institutions to curb Hezbollah\u2019s influence."

      "Hazari drank water from a creek and survived on food he foraged around the mountains, Broadfoot told reporters separately. That included some berries and \u201ca couple of muesli bars in a hut.\u201d",
      "Hazari was \u201cin such good spirits\u201d and \u201cin such great condition,\u201d he said, adding that he was being assessed by paramedics at the search base camp, where cheers were heard and his family was seen hugging him.",
      "Hazari and his two friends, ages 23 and 24, had planned to meet at a campground after they split up, police said in their statement. When he failed to arrive, his friends began searching for him.",
      "The search evolved into a multiagency effort with more than 300 rescuers and volunteers tracking Hazari\u2019s movements in the mountains.",
      "Hope for his survival grew when trash and hiking poles thought to belong to him were found by a river on New Year\u2019s Eve, followed by a campfire, a lighter, a camera and a camera bag on Sunday.",
      "Then, on Wednesday, a hiking group passing near the search zone heard Hazari calling for help.",
      "\u201cMy mate James looked down towards the shouting and we shouted back. We heard him saying, \u2018I need help,\u2019\u201d Joshua Dart, 30, told the Australian broadcaster ABC.",
      "Dart said that he had seen the missing person alert for Hazari but that his group was not actively searching for him.",
      "When they found him after almost two weeks, Hazari appeared to have lost track of time, believing it had been only seven days.",
      "\u201cHe really had good survival instincts,\u201d Dart said."
