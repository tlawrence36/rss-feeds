      "This year's major events include five NBA games and three NFL games, with games spanning more than 12 hours.",
      "Here's a look at the premier matchups \u2014 as well as a few you can probably skip \u2014 while preparing to navigate the holiday.",
      "Spurs at Thunder, 2:30 p.m., ESPN/ABC \u2014 Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs are one of the league's up-and-coming teams, making the NBA Cup final before losing to the Knicks last week. The Thunder won a championship last season and have the league's best record this year at 25-3. Adding a little spice: The Spurs knocked the Thunder out of the NBA Cup in the semifinals earlier this month.",
      "Rockets at Lakers, 8 p.m., ESPN/ABC \u2014 Savor this one, because it's hard to believe we'll have many more opportunities to watch Kevin Durant vs. LeBron James, particularly on Christmas Day. The 37-year-old Durant keeps pouring in buckets for the Rockets while the 40-year-old James is still playing at a high level in his 23rd NBA season.",
      "Timberwolves at Nuggets, 10:30 p.m., ESPN/ABC \u2014 Nothing wrong with this game between two of the better teams in the NBA's Western Conference. Three-time MVP Nikola Jokic is turning in another ridiculous season, averaging a triple-double for the Nuggets. They'll face the Timberwolves, who have the high-flying and always entertaining Anthony Edwards.",
      "Lions at Vikings, 4:30 p.m., Netflix \u2014 This is the best game of a disappointing NFL slate, featuring a Lions team that must win if they want to keep their slim playoff hopes alive. The division rival Vikings have had a frustrating season, but would love to play spoiler and have won their past three games.",

They'll face a Cavaliers team that's faded back to .500 this season after leading the Eastern Conference with 64 wins last year.",
      "Broncos at Chiefs, 8:15 p.m., Prime Video \u2014 Well, this one looked enticing a few months ago, but the fact that Kansas City is eliminated from the playoff race and lost its top two quarterbacks to knee injuries has put a damper on the mood. On the positive side, the Broncos have been one of the best teams in the NFL and are trying to stay ahead of the Los Angeles Chargers and win the AFC West.",

The problem is Dallas is still not playing well, through rookie Cooper Flagg's improvement is an encouraging sign. Warriors veteran star Stephen Curry is capable of big nights like his 48-point performance against the Blazers earlier this month, but Golden State's glory days feel like they're coming to a close.",
      "Cowboys at Commanders, 1 p.m., Netflix \u2014 There will be plenty of eyeballs on this game just because it's the Cowboys and the Commanders, but there's not much here in terms of stakes. Both teams have been eliminated from the playoff race and Washington's starting QB Jayden Daniels is out for the season after aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14.",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a federal appeals court in New York late Tuesday to order his immediate release from prison and reverse his conviction on prostitution-related charges or direct his trial judge to lighten his four-year sentence.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan that Combs was treated harshly at sentencing by a federal judge who let evidence surrounding charges he was acquitted of unjustly influence the punishment.",
      "Combs, 56, incarcerated at a federal prison in New Jersey and scheduled for release in May 2028, was acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at a trial that ended in July.

      "Lawyers for Combs said Judge Arun Subramanian acted like a \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d in October when he sentenced Combs to four years and two months in prison. They said he erred by letting evidence surrounding the acquitted charges influence the sentence he imposed.",

      "Leaves and bodies fall in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d Park Chan-wook\u2019s masterfully devilish satire with a chilling autumnal wind blowing through it.",
      "\u201cCome on, fall,\u201d urges You Man-su (Lee Byung-hun) as he grills an eel for dinner for his family in the opening moments of Park's film. He's eager for the season to start but unprepared for the amount of cyclical collapse \u2014 familial, economic, even existential \u2014 that Park has in store.",
      "Man-su pronounces the very thing no movie protagonist ever should: \u201cI've got it all.\u201d He lives with his wife, Miri (Son Ye-jin), and two children (Kim Woo Seung, Choi So Yul) in a handsome modernist house in the woods, with two golden retrievers. But almost as soon as he says that, Man-su's fortunes turn. After 25 years at a paper mill, Man-su is laid off, as are many others, with little fanfare or apology. Desperation begins to set in. He's forced to sell the home he loves so dearly, including the attached greenhouse where he tends to plants and bonsai trees. They even have to, horror of horrors, cancel Netflix.",
      "Another movie might have sunk with Man-su into bankruptcy and midlife struggle, following his quest to find a new line of work and restart his life. This is not that movie. Man-su, considering his prospects, decides he needs to better his odds of new employment. After posting a fake job listing and comparing all the incoming resumes, he decides he's about the fifth best option for any new paper mill managerial jobs. He decides to kill the ones with better credentials.",
      "The concept, a Grade-A barnburner of a movie idea, is not new. \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d South Korea's Oscar submission, is based on Donald Westlake\u2019s 1997 crime novel \u201cThe Ax,\u201d which Costa-Gavras also made into a film in 2005. But Park, the filmmaker of such diabolical movies as \u201cOldboy,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d and \u201cDecision to Leave,\u201d is exquisitely suited to the material. This is a director capable of conjuring menacing brutality with nothing but a hallway and hammer.",
      "And in \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d he remains at the peak of his powers, archly and elegantly spinning a yarn about a murderous rampage that accumulates wider and wider reverberations. \u201cHitchcockian\u201d is a term that often, understandably, finds Park. He is, like Hitch, a seemingly polite and erudite man with a latently dark imagination. But for more than two decades, Park has cut his own bloody, unyieldingly meticulous path in movies that are rarely predictable, very funny and sneakily revelatory.",

      "Much of the delight of \u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d which Park co-wrote with Lee Kyoung-mi, Don McKellar and Jahye Lee, isn't just seeing how Man-su's scheme goes but how Park frames it. He is probably the preeminent filmmaker of putting wild, outrageous happenings into cleverly formal, eminently stylish imagery. As Man-su bumbles from target to target, each potential murder is a window into another family reckoning with unemployment. The way Man-su spies on them (or worse) adds delicious layers of satire. Relish, especially, the way Park uses reflections and trees.",
      "How \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d puts capitalism in the crosshairs, with a handsome house in the center, will no doubt bring to mind another Korean satire: Bong Joon Ho's \u201cParasite.\u201d Park had been wanting to make his film for almost two decades. Either way, the two movies would make one hell of a destabilizing double feature.",
      "If \u201cParasite\u201d was the feat of an ensemble, \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d belongs to Lee. His Man-su is no killer at heart, and his attempts to become one are as comical as they are Dostoyevskian. The tone is so farcical that the gruesomeness of some of Man-su's acts come slyly. How many movies have we seen about a parent driven, heroically, to extremes to defend their family? Man-su's circumstance is frightfully understandable. \u201cOur family is in a war,\u201d he says. To keep them happy \u2014 in particular Miri \u2014 Man-su thinks whatever it takes is necessary.",
      "But what makes \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d brilliant is how it shows that perceived predicament as a ubiquitous mistake of modern life. I won't spoil the incredible final minutes of Park's film, but they expand the notion of necessary termination \u2014 of a job, of a life \u2014 to automation, AI and beyond. The leaves falling in \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d aren't coming back in the spring.",
      "\u201cNo Other Choice,\u201d a Neon release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for violence, language and some sexual content. In Korean with English subtitles. Running time: 139 minutes. Four stars out of four.",

      "Jim Jarmusch invites audiences into three family gatherings of adult children in his gentle tryptic \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d starring Adam Driver, Cate Blanchett and Tom Waits",
      "Jim Jarmusch invites audiences into three family gatherings of adult children in his gentle tryptic \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother.\u201d",
      "Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t be resentful you\u2019re not part of any of them, not even the one where Tom Waits plays Adam Driver\u2019s dad. To be fair, all the groupings are pretty cool on paper. In the first chapter, siblings Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Mayim Bialik) drive together to visit their father (Waits) for the first time in a while. In the second, a mother (Charlotte Rampling) awaits her grown daughters Tim ( Cate Blanchett ) and Lilith ( Vicky Krieps ) for their annual tea. And in the third, all that\u2019s left of Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy\u2019s (Luka Sabbat) parents are things.",
      "But these are awkward and strained hangouts, none connected to one another literally, and all in different parts of the world. Yet there are little threads throughout \u2014 Rolex watches, toasting with water, red clothing, and the idiom \u201cbob\u2019s your uncle,\u201d for instance. And then there\u2019s the more cosmically haunting realization that familiarity and closeness are not always in the cards when it comes to family. In \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother,\u201d everyone would rather be anywhere but where they are. Same same, but different, you know?",
      "The film opens with \u201cFather,\u201d and siblings Jeff and Emily reluctantly doing a kind of wellness check on theirs. They\u2019re both very buttoned up and formal, both in appearance (blazers, sweaters, combed hair) and demeanor. Waits, as their father, is very much the opposite \u2014 one might imagine that he doesn\u2019t even own a blazer, or a comb for that matter. His home is as rumpled as his zip up hoodie sweatshirt and he is a little bumbling himself, rattling off all the drugs he\u2019s not taking (anymore). The chasm between him and his children is vast and growing. Besides the death of their mother, it doesn\u2019t even seem like there was even some inciting incident that might explain some level of estrangement \u2014 they\u2019re just very, very different. And the father might not be as helpless and destitute as he\u2019s presenting to his children. After they leave, he tidies the place up and calls a friend to go out to a nice dinner.",
      "Blame it on the age of the people who get to make the movies, but the parents are often the afterthoughts, the supporting characters in the children\u2019s stories. Jarmusch slyly inverts this in the \u201cFather\u201d segment, which perfectly tees up expectations for his next entry, \u201cMother,\u201d in which Rampling is on the phone, presumably with a therapist, mentally preparing for her daughters to arrive. They all live around Dublin, but rarely see one another, making this tea a bit of a dreaded ritual. Blanchett\u2019s Tim, a quintessential first born, is very stressed about being late. Krieps\u2019 Lilith, meanwhile, is all about posturing \u2014 bragging about material things and accomplishments that she doesn\u2019t have the receipts for and knows on some level no one believes anyway. These women aren't connecting either.",
      "In the final segment, the parents are gone. They\u2019ve died and left behind only mementos in a Parisian apartment that\u2019s three months overdue on rent. This is both a puzzle and a mess that their children now have to clean up and make sense of. \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d is in some ways deeply cynical about family bonds and the possibility of ever really knowing ones' parents. It\u2019s devoid of warm, fuzzy sentiment and trite revelations, just the crushing idea that no matter what bloodlines might exist, we\u2019re all fundamentally strangers.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet squints as he gazes out at the Manhattan shoreline. It\u2019s a few hours before the premiere of his new movie, \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d but at this moment, he\u2019s sitting on a quiet bench at the end of a West Side pier.",
      "It\u2019s brisk and there\u2019s snow on the ground, but it\u2019s sunny and Chalamet, dressed warmly in a parka, is enjoying the perspective looking back at the city. For him, it\u2019s like looking back on himself.",
      "\u201cNow in my late 20s, there should be every reason to go, \u2018All right, career\u2019s good. Let me start shilling out,\u2019\u201d says Chalamet, who turns 30 just after Christmas. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I\u2019ve quadrupled down on the original pursuit of my life. I\u2019ve gotten out of the pool and redived from a higher board.\u201d",
      "That high dive is \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d Josh Safdie\u2019s hyperkinetic 1950s-set New York tale of a singular striver. Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a Jewish kid working at a shoe store who aspires to be the best table tennis pro in the world. The character is loosely based on a real-life player, Marty Reisman, but the movie is just as much a reflection of Chalamet and Safdie\u2019s own whatever-it-takes ambitions.",
      "\u201cThe gift of my life is this work,\u201d Chalamet says while seagulls fly overhead. \u201cYou want to honor it. Not in some Keynesian way \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right economist to cite. Capitalistic is not what I mean. I mean: If you\u2019re not going up, you\u2019re kind of going down. \u2018He not busy being born is busy dying,\u2019 the great Dylan quote. Ooh, is that on the money.\u201d",
      "Since his breakthrough performance in 2017\u2019s \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d Chalamet has been on an ever-ascending path that seemed to reach a culmination when he, soon after finishing shooting on \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d declared that he\u2019s \u201cin pursuit of greatness\u201d while accepting the best actor award from the Screen Actors Guild for his performance as Bob Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d",
      "But \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is yet another new level for Chalamet. His Marty, far from a period-piece study, is a blur of forward motion. (To shoot the film\u2019s sprinting poster, Safdie closed down two blocks, so Chalamet would be up to full speed.) To make his dreams a reality, Marty uses every desperate scheme and every bit of grandiose swagger. He's a quintessentially American hustler, and it\u2019s probably the defining performance of Chalamet\u2019s young career. A year after he came so close, it may win him his first Academy Award.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like a long arc thing for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m chasing a feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d which opens wide Thursday, is a big test. A24 spent some $70 million on it, making it one of the indie studio\u2019s biggest budgeted movies ever. To build the hype, Chalamet has unveiled some very Marty-esque stunts, including an 18-minute video of a pseudo-Zoom call about the movie\u2019s marketing. That led to a real orange blimp, emblazoned with \u201cDream Big,\u201d flying over Los Angeles.",
      "When The Associated Press caught up with Safdie at his Chelsea office, he had recently returned from promoting the movie in London, Brazil and Los Angeles. For him, \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d could hardly be more personal. Pingpong paddles filled his office, as did an old piece of awning scrounged from Rodney Dangerfield\u2019s New York comedy club. Safdie once tried to turn pro at table tennis, himself, before moviemaking became his obsession.",
      "\u201cMy dad is the ultimate dreamer,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cHe still dreams to this day. When I was a kid, I\u2019d ask him where I came from. And he\u2019d say, \u2018You came from the stars.\u2019 It put this intense feeling inside me that there was huge future ahead of me.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother, Benny, set out to make films, they had a New York hustler mentality. For their second feature, \u201cDaddy Longlegs,\u201d they approached the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, then working as a projectionist, and told him he had to star in the film. Bronstein wasn't even an actor.",
      "\u201cI thought: This guy is made out helium and I\u2019ve had my feet stuck in lead for six years,\u201d recalls Bronstein, who co-wrote \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "The hardscrabble life of independent filmmaking made Safdie accustomed to giving everything to get his movies made. To convince a potential financier to pay for the basketball portions of 2019's \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d Safdie, a non-drinker, remembers downing half a dozen whiskies during a meeting.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re in a position where you\u2019re at their beck and call,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d",
      "When Safdie and his brother finished \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d years of pouring everything into Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler\u2019s character in the film) left him feeling purposeless. \u201cYou start to ask yourself: What is the purpose of a dream?\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the guy. Some agent told me he was the next big superstar. And you hear that a lot from agents,\u201d says Safdie. \u201cBut you got the sense that he saw it. And he had a vision for it. He had this energy to him. He was Timmy Supreme.\u201d",
      "Safdie sent Chalamet a video of table tennis players from 1948 set to Peter Gabriel\u2019s \u201cI Have the Touch.\u201d The suggestion was: This is a period movie told with contemporary topspin. For years, while working on other movie sets, Chalamet built up his table tennis skills.",
      "\u201cJosh wanted me to tap into a period of my life when my audacity was all I had,\u201d Chalamet says. Immediately, he saw himself in Marty. \u201cI was singularly driven starting at 14.\u201d",
      "Safdie and Chalamet are now launching something almost anathema in theaters this holiday season: a wholly original, big-budget, R-rated movie fronted by star power. Signs suggest audiences aren\u2019t just ready, they\u2019re hungry for it. The limited opening of \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d in six cinemas, set per-screen records. There were 92 sellouts.",
      "\u201cI said this when I went to (former high school) LaGuardia last year: Don\u2019t act for other actors. Act for real audiences,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cWhile we were shooting \u2018Dune 3\u2019 over the summer, Denis (Villeneuve) said at some point he realized it was more about pleasing real people. You look at the business structure of the film industry, how it\u2019s been contracting since the \u201980s, it\u2019s ludicrous to be focused on anything but real audiences.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to see more original movies made,\u201d adds Chalamet. \u201cThey\u2019re the most exciting ones to see. Every original film I\u2019ve seen this year, I like it before I even start it. That\u2019s a whole new mentality I\u2019ve had, just feeling like we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is also a part of the proud lineage of New York movies, and self-consciously crafted in an American movie tradition. It may feel like a millennial watershed, but its production design is by a legend of an earlier era, Jack Fisk. The 74-year-old Bronx filmmaker Abel Ferrara appears in it. They're veterans of a grittier, more handcrafted time stretching back to the 1970s that's been particularly influential to Safdie. Robert Altman\u2019s 1902-set 1971 film \u201cMcCabe and Mrs. Miller,\u201d he notes, is the exact same time difference between when it takes place and when it was shot as \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe tradition, particularly of New York filmmaking, movies like \u2018French Connection,\u2019 I try to let them seep into me,\u201d Safdie says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m casting Abel Ferrara. I\u2019m trying to at least cultivate those influences.\u201d",
      "That \u201cMarty Supreme\u201d is a deeply New York film, and maybe a new classic one, is also a special point of pride for Chalamet, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen. Leaning forward as the afternoon winter light brightens the waterfront, Chalamet remembers he used to play soccer as a kid on this pier.",
      "\u201cJust to be here, back where I\u2019m from. What a dream,\u201d Chalamet says. \u201cI also feel like my artistry has grown, not as a talking point or as hyperbole, but as a humble fact of foundation.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the kind of thing Marty might say. Indeed, some of Chalamet\u2019s recent declarations have struck some like he\u2019s still in character. Asked whether he\u2019s sincere or engaging in a little Method marketing, Chalamet takes a long pause and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d",

      "According to research from the 506 Sports Archive, the Christmas night game between the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs on Prime Video will be his 779th NFL broadcast.",
      "\u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a fantastic ride. I mean, it\u2019s unbelievable because it came out of nowhere back in 1986,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking 40 years, you don\u2019t think in those terms when you\u2019re 40 years old, but here we are. It\u2019s hard to believe, but I am blessed and thankful.\u201d",
      "Except for two years in 1974 and \u201875, when Michaels did afternoon games for NBC and CBS, Michaels\u2019 broadcasts have been mostly in prime time. He has also called 11 Super Bowls, tying him with Pat Summerall.",
      "Michaels was the play-by-play voice for ABC\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d from 1986 until 2005. He was then traded to NBC when it launched \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d in 2006, and he called that package until 2021. This is his fourth season doing Prime Video\u2019s \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d",
      "Michaels is the dean of NFL announcers in terms of games called. CBS\u2019 Kevin Harlan is the closest among active announcers, with 542, and would need at least 13 seasons to catch Michaels whenever he decides to retire.",
      "Michaels, who turned 81 in November, has shown no signs of slowing down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all done so many big games at this point, but he truly gets excited when he has the opportunity to do a big game. And you can\u2019t say that for a lot of people in our business,\u201d said Fred Gaudelli, who was Michaels\u2019 producer for 23 seasons. \u201cAfter a certain amount of time, you lose that fire in your belly to really do it, and he\u2019s never lost that.\"",
      "Kirk Herbstreit, who is in his fourth season as Michaels\u2019 partner, said he has grown to appreciate Michaels\u2019 ability to manage a broadcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always noticed that the bigger the moment, when you really feel urgency as a broadcaster, Al gets calmer and just waits for the right time to bring his voice to that crescendo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve just been blown away by how he does his job, how organized and prepared he is, and how much he loves it. That\u2019s what really comes across to me. He is completely dialed in, loves the sport, and loves telling stories.\u201d",
      "Michaels has worked with eight analysts. Cris Collinsworth worked with him the longest, at 13 seasons, while his seven years with John Madden rank among the best booth pairings.",
      "ABC Sports executive Dennis Swanson decided to bring Michaels aboard and move Frank Gifford to the analyst spot on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d after firing O.J. Simpson and Joe Namath.",

      "\u201cFrank and I got along great, but I think the feeling was from Swanson and the people at ABC is that Frank had been out of the game so long that they needed to or felt they needed to bring somebody more contemporary in,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cDan was an easy fit for us. I mean, a three-man booth is never easy, and it is rough around the analysts because they have to decide who\u2019s coming in at what point, but it was a natural flow.\u201d",

      "The most unique booth was the 2000 and \u201901 seasons when Michaels was paired with Dan Fouts and comedian Dennis Miller. It also created an interesting dynamic for Michaels.",
      "\u201cIt was so different than anything else I\u2019ve done in my entire 50-year career,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cIt was not easy because my biggest problem was Dennis had a lot of really good lines, but if I laughed too much, I would sound like a hyena. And if I didn\u2019t laugh, then people would say, Al hates him. Dan is trying to do regular analysis, and we had to adjust and adapt.",
      "\u201cI look back very fondly on those years because they were different. I love to laugh, and working with Dennis Miller, you\u2019re going to laugh a lot. I did off the air as well as on.\u201d",
      "Michaels said Miller\u2019s greatest line came during the wild New York Jets comeback victory over the Miami Dolphins in 2000, when Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott caught a TD pass to send it into overtime.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first touchdown of his career, and Dennis chimes right in and goes, \u2018couldn\u2019t keep him down forever,\u2019 which was just a phenomenal line, phenomenal in that moment. So that was Dennis at his best. You\u2019re just capturing a moment, saying something pithy like that. It is funny,\u201d Michaels said.",
      "Michaels has been part of a two-man booth since 2002, when Madden came over from Fox to join \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d They worked together for seven seasons, including the move to NBC in 2006 when \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d started.",
      "Their first broadcast together was the 2002 Hall of Fame game. By the second commercial break, Michaels felt their partnership was already natural.",
      "Michaels\u2019 hardest season was 2005, the last on ABC before \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d moved to ESPN. Madden went to NBC, as did producer Gaudelli and director Drew Esocoff. After Super Bowl 40, Michaels was traded to NBC in exchange for the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Walt Disney\u2019s precursor to Mickey Mouse that had ended up in NBC's control.",
      "The \u201cPrime Video\u201d broadcasts have subtly celebrated Michaels\u2019 long career with a segment called \u201cThe Al-Manac,\u201d where a key moment from a great game that Michaels has called is shown, and he gives his memories of the play or the game.",
      "Mark Teitelman, the lead game producer for \u201cThursday Night Football,\u201d said Michaels\u2019 history of calling big games and storytelling ability made it a natural addition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a pretty good chance if it\u2019s a game you remember, Al called that game,\u201d Teitelman said.",
      "Michaels\u2019 favorite game remains Super Bowl 43 in 2009 when the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied to beat the Arizona Cardinals. Besides Santonio Holmes\u2019 6-yard TD catch with 35 seconds remaining, the game also included James Harrison\u2019s 100-yard interception return on the last play of the first half.",
      "It was also Madden\u2019s last game as an analyst. He announced his retirement three months later.",
      "Michaels has felt a jolt of energy working with Herbstreit, who is the busiest man in football between his college and NFL duties.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how he does it. He\u2019s got gigantic energy, and he\u2019s tremendously well prepared,\u201d Michaels said. \u201cWe have a lot of fun. I think we have a great back-and-forth, give-and-take. It\u2019s natural. It took a little while to become natural, but it does with anybody. And once we got going, great.\u201d",
      "Prime Video is averaging 14.96 million viewers, making it the most-watched season since a regular Thursday night package started in 2006. That is a 13% increase over last year\u2019s average and a huge leap from 9.58 million average during Prime Video\u2019s first year in 2022.",

      "It's the second best global debut of the year.",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d opened with $345 million in worldwide sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, notching the second-best global debut of the year and potentially putting James Cameron on course to set yet more blockbuster records.",
      "Sixteen years into the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, Pandora is still abundant in box-office riches. \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d the third film in Cameron\u2019s science-fiction franchise, launched with $88 million domestically and $257 million internationally. The only film to open bigger in 2025 was \u201cZootopia 2\u201d ($497.2 million over three days). In the coming weeks, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will have the significant benefit of the highly lucrative holiday moviegoing corridor.",
      "But there was a tad less fanfare to this \u201cAvatar\u201d film, coming three years after \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water.\u201d That film launched in 2022 with a massive $435 million globally and $134 million in North America. Domestically, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d fell a hefty 35% from the previous installment. Reviews for \u201cFire and Ash\u201d were also more mixed, scoring a series-low 68% \u201cfresh\u201d score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "Yet those quibbles are only a product of the lofty standards of \u201cAvatar.\u201d The first two films rank as two of the three biggest box-office films of all time. To reach those heights, the \u201cAvatar\u201d films have depended on legs more than huge openings.",
      "\u201cAvatar\u201d (2009), opened with $77 million domestically but held the top spot for seven weeks. It ultimately grossed $2.92 billion worldwide. \u201cThe Way of Water\u201d also held strong to eventually tally $2.3 billion globally.",
      "\u201cThe openings are not what the \u2018Avatar\u2019 movies are about,\u201d said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s what they do after they open that made them the no. 2 and no. 3 biggest films of all time.\u201d",
      "For \u201cFire and Ash\u201d to follow in those footsteps, it will need robust ticket sales to continue for weeks. Working in its favor so far: strong word-of-mouth. Audiences gave it an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "In interviews, Cameron has repeatedly said \u201cFire and Ash\u201d needs to perform well for there to be subsequent \u201cAvatar\u201d films. (Four and five are already written but not greenlit.) These are exceptionally expensive movies to make. With a production budget of at least $400 million, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is one of the costliest movies ever made.",
      "\u201cJames Cameron is not known for his low budget movies,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cYou can\u2019t exactly create the world of Pandora on the cheap. If you\u2019re going to have a 3D movie, an epic film that\u2019s three hours and 17 minutes, it\u2019s a huge buy-in of money, time, resources, and then you have to hope the audience wants to once again go along on that ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d was especially boosted by premium format showings, which accounted for 66% of its opening weekend. A narrow majority of moviegoers (56%) chose to watch it in 3D.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have always been especially popular overseas. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d was strongest in China, where its $57.6 million opening weekend surpassed the two previous movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d didn\u2019t have the weekend entirely to itself. A trio of other new wide releases made it into theaters in hopes of offering some counterprogramming: Lionsgate\u2019s \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cDavid\u201d and Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants.\u201d",
      "In the race for second place, \u201cDavid\u201d came out on top. The animated tale of David and Goliath collected $22 million from 3,118 theaters, notching the best opening weekend for Angel Studios, the Christian-oriented studio that emerged with 2023\u2019s surprise hit \u201cSound of Freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d Paul Feig\u2019s twisty psychological thriller starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, opened with $19 million 3,015 theaters. The Lionsgate release, which cost about $35 million to make, is set up well to be one of the top R-rated options in theaters over the holidays. Based on Freida McFadden\u2019s bestselling novel, it stars Sweeney as a woman with a troubled past who becomes a live-in maid for a wealthy family.",
      "Trailing the pack was \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d which collected $16 million from 3,557 theaters.

      "The Grammys' country album category has been split into two for the 2026 award show",
      "NEW YORK -- Flashback to February. It's the 2025 Grammys, and Beyonc\u00e9 has made history. Not only was she finally awarded the top prize of album of the year, but she also became the first Black woman to win best country album, for \u201cCowboy Carter.\u201d Recent changes by the Recording Academy have made it even more monumental: She might be the last person to ever win the award.",
      "In June, the Academy announced that the Grammys' country album title was splitting into two categories. A new award was created, traditional country album. The preexisting country album category has been redefined and is now contemporary country album, reflecting the genre's ongoing sonic evolutions.",
      "The decision was divisive: Some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9's win. Others welcomed the addition of a new award and the creative doors it might open. Some questioned how the categories would be defined in a genre where the word \u201ctraditional\u201d is loaded.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about the change \u2014 and what it could signify in the future.",
      "Charles L. Hughes, Rhodes College professor and author of \u201cCountry Soul,\u201d says Beyonc\u00e9's victory was a welcomed surprise, despite being obviously worthy. That's because her album inspired a larger conversation about reclamation, standing in opposition to the music industry's rigid power structures and \u201cindicated how significant this historical question remains of whether or not Black folks have equal access to success in a genre of music that bears such strong Black influences and has from the very beginning,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He believes the decision to alter the country album categories was not in direct response to her win \u2014 \u201cI think it is a more complicated story,\u201d he says \u2014 but the timing might've been less than ideal, emboldening fans to view it as reactionary. He hopes the changes will open the category to more diversity of sounds and \u201cwhether this leads to a broader opening and opportunity for Black artists, especially Black women in country music,\u201d he posits.",
      "Francesca T. Royster, a DePaul University professor and author of \u201cBlack Country Music: Listening for Revolutions,\u201d views Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s victory as positively connected to this change. She wonders if artists \u2014 particularly artists of color, who never had their music recognized in country music categories, think of artists like \u201cMillie Jackson or Candi Staton, Bobby Womack\u201d \u2014 would now see their work recognized. \u201cHaving these two categories just allows for more experimentation and maybe less of a double standard,\u201d she says, \u201cin terms of artists who are often held to higher standards to conform to, or be recognizable as, meeting an idea about what country music is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes sense that the Grammy categories for country would become a little bit more expansive,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think the music is more expansive and the audience is also more expansive than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "According to the Recording Academy's rule book, the traditional country category is defined by \u201ccountry recordings that adhere to the more traditional sound structures of the country genre, including rhythm and singing style, lyrical content, as well as traditional country instrumentation.\u201d",
      "Those are: acoustic guitar, steel guitar, fiddle, banjo, mandolin, piano, electric guitar and live drums. This is also where subgenres like outlaw country, Western and Western swing would fit.",
      "The contemporary country category description is a bit more conceptual. The rule book states that albums eligible in this category \u201cutilize a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content, and/or musical presentation to create a sensibility that reflects the broad spectrum of contemporary country style and culture.\u201d",
      "The hope is that those titles are \u201crelevant to the legacy of country music\u2019s culture, while also engaging in more contemporary music forms.\u201d",
      "The questions Hughes poses: \u201cWhose tradition are we talking about?\u201d And how is \u201ccountry music's culture\u201d defined?",
      "\u201cIt's almost tautology. \u2018Well, it\u2019s traditional country if it sounds like traditional country,'\u201d he says.",
      "In that reading, contemporary country could simply account for everything else.",
      "Royster says both categories seem to \u201cspeak to an aesthetic as well as political agenda, many agendas.\u201d To her, the traditional category would appeal to artists who believe that \u201cthis is a past form that needs to ... continue to be recognized and respected.\u201d Similarly, the contemporary category is \u201clinked to the culture of country but is also expansive.\u201d",

      "In the traditional category, it is Charley Crockett's \u201cDollar a Day,\u201d Lukas Nelson's \u201cAmerican Romance,\u201d Willie Nelson's \u201cOh What a Beautiful World,\u201d Margo Price's \u201cHard Headed Woman,\u201d and Zach Top's \u201cAin\u2019t In It For My Health.\u201d",
      "Royster wonders if with this first year of nominees, \u201cthere's less risk in terms of recognizing the kind of \u2018country-ness\u2019 of these artists.\u201d Royster views the lineup as \u201cartists (whose) country creds would still be recognized even if they\u2019re also bringing in other elements. I would hope in the future there might be more room in the category.\u201d",
      "For Hughes, the nominees further confuse the distinctions. Consider this example: Zach Top's album borrows heavily from George Strait's sound, which emerged in the \u201870s as a mesh of honky-tonk traditions and contemporary country. Hip-hop also emerged in the \u201970s. They were simultaneous. \u201cBut I have a feeling we won\u2019t be seeing a lot of hip-hop-inspired artists in the traditional category,\u201d he says.",
      "But that doesn't mean it might not evolve in the future. \u201cIf the Grammys fundamentally exist to give people recognition,\u201d he says, \u201cThe more, the merrier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnytime the pipe widens, more water gets through. And this was the pipe widening, baby,\u201d Jelly Roll, who is nominated in the inaugural best contemporary country album category, told The Associated Press. \u201cI love it. I'm happy. I\u2019m a fan of both sides. It encourages me to maybe make a traditional country album one day, you know? So, this is cool.\u201d",
      "Three-time Grammy award winner Brad Paisley has a similar stance: There's a benefit to having more country music recognitions.",
      "\u201cAwards are really tools to sort of get awareness for something that you made, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re never the goal. It\u2019s always more like, \u2018Oh, cool, this might make more people listen to it.\u2019 \u2026 If this means they got to make more little gold gramophone statues to give out, and two people get them versus one, great.\u201d",
      "That said: Paisley's not sure which category he would fall into, or if the division could color an artist's creative decisions. \u201cI\u2019d almost have to think it through like, \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going for the Grammy on this. I better not do this on this record or something.\u2019 But hopefully that doesn\u2019t ever enter into it,\u201d he says.",
      "Hopefully, it's just a panel decided who belongs in which category, \u201cand then two people get to go home happy versus one. And that\u2019s good in my book,\u201d he said.",

      "But here\u2019s the thing: everybody may want to rule the world, but not everybody truly believes they CAN. This, one could argue, is what separates the true strivers from the rest of us.",
      "And Marty \u2014 played by Chalamet in a delicious synergy of actor, role and whatever fairy dust makes a performance feel both preordained and magically fresh \u2014 is a striver. With every fiber of his restless, wiry body. They should add him to the dictionary definition.",

Suddenly we\u2019re seeing footage of sperm traveling \u2014 talk about strivers! \u2014 up to an egg. Which morphs, of course, into a pingpong ball.",
      "This witty opening sequence won\u2019t be the only thing recalling \u201cUncut Gems,\u201d co-directed by Safdie with his brother Benny before the two split for solo projects. That film, which feels much like the precursor to \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d began as a trip through the shiny innards of a rare opal, only to wind up inside Adam Sandler\u2019s colon, mid-colonoscopy.",
      "Sandler\u2019s Howard Ratner was a New York striver, too, but sadder, and more troubled. Marty is young, determined, brash \u2014 with an eye always to the future. He\u2019s a great salesman: \u201cI could sell shoes to an amputee,\u201d he boasts, crassly. But what he\u2019s plotting to unveil to the world has nothing to do with shoes. It\u2019s about table tennis.",
      "How likely is it that this Jewish kid from the Lower East Side can become the very face of a sport in America, soon to be \u201cstaring at you from the cover of a Wheaties box?\u201d",

      "Shaking off that sorta-armed robbery thing, Marty arrives in London, where he fast-talks his way into a suite at the Ritz. Here, he spies fellow guest Kay Stone (Gwyneth Paltrow, in a wise, stylish return to the screen), a former movie star married to an insufferable tycoon (\u201cShark Tank\u201d personality Kevin O\u2019Leary, one of many nonactors here.)",
      "Kay\u2019s skeptical, but Marty finds a way to woo her. Really, all he has to say is: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d Once she sees him play, she\u2019s sneaking into his room in a lace corselet.",

      "Elsewhere on the creative team, composer Daniel Lopatin succeeds in channelling both Marty\u2019s beating heart and the ricochet of pingpong balls in his propulsive score. The script by Safdie and cowriter Ronald Bronstein, loosely based on real-life table tennis hustler Marty Reisman, beats with its own, never-stopping pulse. The same breakneck aesthetic applies to camera work by Darius Khondji.",

      "Is there something else for Marty, besides his obsessive goal? If so, he doesn\u2019t know it yet. But the lyrics of another song used in the film are instructive here: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to learn sometime.\u201d",
      "So can a single-minded striver ultimately learn something new about his own life?",
      "We'll have to see. As Marty might say: \u201cCome watch me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d an A24 release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor language throughout, sexual content, some violent content/bloody images and nudity.\u201d Running time: 149 minutes. Four stars out of four.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone\u2019s gender expression doesn\u2019t match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited.",
      "\u201cSecretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors\u2019 offices,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS\u2019s declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",

      "A new Department of Health and Human Services report reveals Medicaid programs made over $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died",
      "WASHINGTON -- Medicaid programs made more than $200 million in improper payments to health care providers between 2021 and 2022 for people who had already died, according to a new report from the independent watchdog for the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "But the department's Office of Inspector General said it expects a new provision in Republicans\u2019 One Big Beautiful Bill requiring states to audit their Medicaid beneficiary lists may help reduce these improper payments in the future.",
      "These kinds of improper payments are \u201cnot unique to one state, and the issue continues to be persistent,\u201d Aner Sanchez, deputy regional inspector general in the Office of Audit Services told The Associated Press. Sanchez has been researching this issue for a decade.",
      "The watchdog report released Tuesday said more than $207.5 million in managed care payments were made on behalf of deceased enrollees between July 2021 to July 2022. The office recommends that the federal government share more information with state governments to recover the incorrect payments \u2014 including a Social Security database known as the Full Death Master File, which contains more than 142 million records going back to 1899.",
      "Sharing the Full Death Master File data has been tightly restricted due to privacy laws which protect against identity theft and fraud.",
      "The massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by President Donald Trump this summer expands how the Full Death Master File can be used by mandating Medicaid agencies to quarterly audit their provider and beneficiary lists against the file, beginning in 2027. The intent is to stop payments to dead people and improve accuracy.",

Since 2016, HHS' inspector general has conducted 18 audits on a selection of state programs and had identified that Medicaid agencies had improperly made managed care payments on behalf of deceased enrollees totaling approximately $289 million.",
      "The government had some success using the Full Death Master File to prevent improper payments earlier this year. In January, the Treasury Department reported that it had clawed back more than $31 million in federal payments that improperly went to dead people as part of a five-month pilot program after Congress gave Treasury temporary access to the file for three years as part of the 2021 appropriations bill.",
      "Meanwhile, the SSA has been making unusual updates to the file itself, adding and removing records, and complicating its use. For instance, the Trump administration in April moved to classify thousands of living immigrants as dead and cancel their Social Security numbers to crack down on immigrants who had been temporarily allowed to live in the U.S. under programs started during the Biden administration.",

      "In some places, the order is galvanizing support for syringe exchange programs, which decades of research show are extremely effective at preventing disease among intravenous drug users and getting them into treatment.",

Unless lawmakers extend it, that law is scheduled to sunset next year, and the number of exchanges has been dwindling.

    "story": [
      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",
      "Shweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Thailand and Cambodia will resume talks later this week to work toward a more durable ceasefire along their border, Thailand\u2019s foreign minister said Monday, stressing that progress depends on detailed bilateral negotiations rather than public declarations that internationalize the dispute.",
      "A ceasefire agreement in October was rushed to ensure it could be witnessed by U.S. President Donald Trump and lacked sufficient details to ensure the deal to end the armed conflict would hold, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Monday after an Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",
      "While Cambodia has publicy said it is ready for an unconditional ceasefire, Bangkok never received any direct proposal and Thailand believed such statements were aimed at increasing international pressure rather than resolving the issue, Sihasak said following the meeting that was arranged to seek ways to end the crisis.",
      "The general border committee involving both nations will meet Wednesday to iron out detailed measures toward a lasting ceasefire, he said.",
      "\u201cThis time, let's thrash out the details and make sure the ceasefire reflect the situation on the ground and the ceasefire is one that really holds, and both sides are going to fully respect the ceasefire,\u201d Sihasak told a news conference.",
      "The border conflict escalated into deadly combat two weeks ago and derailed the agreement promoted by Trump, which ended five days of fighting in July. The agreement was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through under pressure from Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. The ceasefire was formalized with more detail at an October regional summit in Malaysia attended by Trump.",
      "The fighting has drawn international concern. The U.S. Department of State on Sunday released a statement calling for Thailand and Cambodia to \u201cend hostilities, withdraw heavy weapons, cease emplacement of landmines, and fully implement the Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords, which include mechanisms to accelerate humanitarian demining and address border issues.\u201d",
      "The fighting is a result of a dispute over patches of territory claimed by both nations along their shared border.",
      "The latest round of fighting began Dec. 8, a day after a border skirmish wounded two Thai soldiers. Since then combat has broken out on several fronts, with Thailand carrying out airstrikes in Cambodia with F-16 fighter jets and Cambodia firing thousands of medium-range BM-21 rockets from truck-mounted launchers that can launch up to 40 rockets simultaneously.",
      "More than three dozen people on both sides of the border have officially been reported killed in the past week of fighting, while more than half a million have been displaced, according to officials.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \u201cunacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they did not pose such risks.",

      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision.

    "story": [
      "In a breathless year of tariffs unleashed by the administration of President Donald Trump, perhaps no one has had to live the reality of every fluctuation of trade policy than customs brokers",
      "NEW YORK -- After a half-century immersed in the world of trade, customs broker Amy Magnus thought she\u2019d seen it all, navigating mountains of regulations and all sorts of logistical hurdles to import everything from lumber and bananas to circus animals and Egyptian mummies.",
      "Then came 2025.",
      "Tariffs were imposed in ways she\u2019d never seen. New rules left her wondering what they really meant. Federal workers, always a reliable backstop, grew more elusive.",
      "\u201c2025 has changed the trade system,\u201d says Magnus. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect before, but it was a functioning system. Now, it is a lot more chaotic and troubling.\u201d",
      "Once hidden cogs in the international trade machine, customs brokers are getting a rare spotlight as President Donald Trump reinvents America\u2019s commercial ties with the world. If this breathless year of tariffs amounts to a trade war, customs brokers are its front lines.",
      "Few Americans have been exposed as exhaustively to every fluctuation of trade policy as the customs broker. They were there in the opening days of Trump\u2019s second term, when tariffs were announced on Canada and Mexico, and two days later, when those same levies were paused. They were there through every rule on imports of steel and seafood, on cars and copper, on polysilicon and pharmaceuticals, and on and on. For every tariff, for every carve-out, for every order, brokers have been left to translate policy into reality, line by line and code by code, in a year when it seemed every passing week brought change.",
      "\u201cWe were used to decades of a certain way of processing, and from January to now, that universe has been turned kind of upside-down on us,\u201d says Al Raffa, a customs broker in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who helps shepherd containerloads of cargo into the U.S. packed to the brim with everything from rounds of brie to boxes of chocolate.",
      "Each arrival of products imported to the country requires filings with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and often, other agencies. Importers often turn to brokers to handle the regulatory legwork and, with a spate of new trade rules unleashed by the Trump administration, they\u2019ve seen their demand grow alongside their workloads.",
      "Many shipments that entered duty free now are tariffed. Other imports that had minimal levies that might cost a company a few hundred dollars have had their bills balloon to thousands. For Raffa and his crew, the ever-expanding list of tariffs means a given product could be subjected to taxes under multiple separate tariff lines.",
      "\u201cThat one line item of cheese that previously was just one tariff, now it could be two, three, in some cases five tariff numbers,\u201d says 53-year-old Raffa, who has had jobs in trade since he was a teenager and who has a button emblazoned with \u201cMake Trade Boring Again.\u201d",
      "Government regulations have always been a reality for brokers, and the very reason for their existence. When thick tomes of trade rules changed in the past, though, they typically were issued long ahead of their effective dates, with periods for comment and review, each word of policy crafted in an attempt to project clarity and definition.",
      "With Trump, word of a major change in trade rules might come in a Truth Social post or an oversized chart clutched by the president in a Rose Garden appearance.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019d be remiss not to be looking at the White House website on a daily basis, multiple times a day, just to see what executive order is going to be announced,\u201d Raffa says.",
      "Each announcement sends brokerage firms into a scramble to attempt to dissect the rules, update their systems to reflect them and alert their customers who may have shipments en route and for whom any shift in tariffs could mean a major hit to their bottom line.",
      "JD Gonzalez, a third-generation customs broker in Laredo, Texas, and president of the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of America, says the volume and speed of changes have been challenging enough. But the wording of White House orders has often left more unanswered questions than brokers are accustomed to.",
      "\u201cThe order is kind of vague sometimes, the guidance that\u2019s being provided is sometimes murky, and we\u2019re trying to make the determination,\u201d 62-year-old Gonzalez says.",

      "Gonzalez rattles off 10-digit tariff codes for alcohol and doors and recites the complicated web of rules that determine the duties on a chair with a frame made of steel produced in the U.S. but processed in Mexico. As brokers\u2019 work has grown tougher, he says some of their firms have begun charging customers more for their services because each item they\u2019re responsible for tracking on a bill of lading takes longer.",
      "\u201cYou double the time,\u201d he says.",
      "Brokers can\u2019t help but see the imprints of their work everywhere they go. Gonzalez looks at a T-shirt tag and thinks of what a broker did to get it into the country. Magnus sees Belgian chocolate or Chinese silk and is awed, despite all the things that could have kept something from landing on a store shelf, that it still arrived. Raffa walks through the supermarket, picks up a can of artichoke hearts, and considers every possible regulation that might apply to secure its import into the country.",
      "It has been heartening for brokers, who existed in the gray arcana of hidden bureaucracy unseen by most Americans, to now earn a bit more recognition.",
      "\u201cIt was maybe taken for granted how that wonderful piece of gourmet cheese got on the shelf, or that Gucci bag,\u201d says Raffa. \u201cUp until this year, people were clueless what I did.\u201d",
      "Magnus, who is in her 70s and based on Marco Island, Florida, spent 18 years at U.S. Customs before starting at a brokerage in 1992. She came to find comfort in the precision of rules governing every import she cleared the way for, from crude oil to diamonds.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t like to have any doubt, we don\u2019t like to leave anything up to interpretation,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we ourselves are struggling, trying to interpret and understand the meaning of some of these things, it is a very unsettling place to be.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just the White House orders that have complicated her work.",
      "The Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting blitz under billionaire Elon Musk led to layoffs and retirements of trusted government workers that brokers turn to for guidance. A shutdown slowed operations at ports. And fear of being out of step with the administration has some federal employees cautious about decoding trade orders, making answers on interpretation of tariff rules sometimes tough to come by.",
      "Magnus was befuddled by moves that seemed at odds with everything she knew of trade policy. Canada as adversary? Switzerland subjected to 39% tariffs? It defied how she had come to see the choreography of cargo and what it says about the world.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like an incredible ballet to be able to trade with all these countries all over the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIn my own mind, I always felt that as long as we were trading and we were friendly with each other, we were reducing the chance of war and killing each other.\u201d",
      "Work has been so hectic this year that Magnus hasn\u2019t managed to take a vacation. Weekends have so frequently been upended by Friday afternoon edicts announcing a tariff is going into effect or being taken away that it has become an inside joke with colleagues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Friday afternoon,\u201d she says. \u201cIs everybody watching?\u201d",
      "A couple hours after Magnus repeats this, the next White House order is posted, undoing a slew of tariffs on agricultural products and sending brokers into another scurry.",

      "The Arif Habib consortium submitted a winning bid of 135 billion rupees ($482 million) for the majority shareholding in PIA, which was once regarded as among the region\u2019s top airlines but has suffered decades of financial losses and mismanagement.",

Most airlines operate with fewer than 200 employees per aircraft, a common benchmark of productivity.",

    "story": [
      "Fast shipping has become a staple of online shopping, promising delivery within a day or even hours",
      "It feels simple: You shop, find something you want and click to buy. It shows up today, overnight or tomorrow. We\u2019ve gotten used to that speed. But that convenience comes with a climate cost.",
      "Multiple factors shape the environmental toll of a delivery. These include the distance from a fulfillment center, whether the shipment rides in a half-empty truck, how many trips a driver makes in the same area and the type of transportation used to move the package.",
      "When customers choose faster shipping and earlier delivery dates, the system shifts from optimized routing to whatever gets the package out fastest, and that means higher emissions, said Sreedevi Rajagopalan, a research scientist at MIT\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics. For example, trucks may leave warehouses before they\u2019re full and drivers might loop the same neighborhood multiple times a day, she said.",
      "\u201cFor the same demand, fast shipping definitely increases emissions 10 to 12%,\u201d she said.",
      "To meet tight delivery windows, retailers may rely on air freight, which produces far more emissions than other options such as trains, making it the most carbon-intensive.",
      "\u201cGiven that companies want to be competitive in terms of speed, it comes at the cost of your efficiency,\u201d Sreedevi said. \u201cVans are half full, and you make multiple rounds, multiple trips to the same location \u2026 your fuel consumption goes up, and you\u2019re not able to consolidate.\u201d",
      "One way companies like Amazon try to minimize that is by placing their supply chain closer to customers to reduce mileage and improve speed for the customer. Their goal is to make the journey fast and effective, but reduce its emissions at the same time.",
      "\u201cBy really leveraging our supply chain efficiencies that we have at scale, we\u2019re able to both offer better speed and sustainability outcomes at the same time,\u201d said Chris Atkins, director of Worldwide Operations Sustainability at Amazon.",
      "Getting items to customers\u2019 doors from a fulfillment center \u2014 referred to as the \u201clast mile\u201d or \u201clast kilometer\u201d of shipping \u2014 is one of the hardest stages to make less polluting, Sreedevi said.",
      "Emissions rise even more when customers place multiple small orders throughout the week.",
      "\u201cIf I place an order this morning and then I place an order this evening and choose fast shipping, the company might have already processed my morning order and wouldn\u2019t wait for my evening order to consolidate,\" she said.",

      "\u201cImagine you\u2019re not only sending a half-full truck, you\u2019re also bringing back that truck empty. ... Emissions are going to go up,\" Sreedevi said.",
      "Consumers can lower emissions if they're willing to wait even a tiny bit, and they'll save money at the same time, said Christopher Faires, assistant professor of logistics and supply chain management at Georgia Southern University.",
      "Delaying delivery by one to two days can result in a 36% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and three to four days pushes that reduction to 56%, so opting for standard or delayed shipping instead of next-day or two-day shipping helps, according to Sreedevi.",
      "Amazon's Atkins said changes to their network are cutting emissions linked to fast delivery. The company has expanded the use of electric delivery vans and shifted more packages to rail and to delivering by foot or bicycle in dense cities.",
      "\u201cAviation is very carbon-intensive relative to ground shipping,\u201d said Atkins. \u201cOne of the other things that Amazon and other logistics companies are looking at doing is: How do we mode-shift to less carbon intensive forms of transportation?\"",
      "Amazon says providing shipping options that encourage customers to consolidate orders have also helped. Data for the first nine months of 2025 shows that when customers chose a single delivery day for all items, it reduced more than 300 million delivery stops and avoided 100,000 tons (90,718 metric tons) of carbon emissions, according to Atkins.",
      "People are more likely to delay or consolidate orders once they understand the environmental impact of fast shipping, according to Sreedevi, who co-authored a 2024 study of delivery customers in Mexico.",
      "\u201cA significant number of consumers decided to wait for longer delivery or delayed their shipping when we showed them the environmental impact information in the form of trees,\u201d said Sreedevi. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that they are educated.\u201d",
      "While fast shipping isn\u2019t likely to go away, experts say its climate impacts can be meaningfully reduced through small behavior shifts, both from shoppers and companies. Bundling orders, skipping the overnight option and choosing a single weekly delivery can all make a difference.",

      "California officials said last month that the state notified about 17,000 truckers that their commercial driver's licenses would be revoked because the expiration dates went past when the drivers were legally allowed to be in the U.S. That number has since grown to 21,000.",

      "This was a scary good year for investors",
      "NEW YORK -- It was a scary good year for investors.",
      "It was scary because the U.S. stock market plunged to several historic drops on worries about everything from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs to interest rates to a possible bubble in artificial-intelligence technology. In the end, though, it was a great year for anyone with the stomach to stick through the swings.",
      "S&P 500 index funds, which sit at the heart of many savers\u2019 401(k) accounts, returned more than 18% in 2025 through Dec. 11 and set a record high that day. It\u2019s their third straight year of big returns.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the surprises that shaped financial markets along the way:",
      "Trump dropped the biggest surprise on \u201cLiberation Day\u201d in April, when he announced a sweeping set of tariffs that were more severe than investors expected.",
      "It immediately triggered worries about a possible recession and spiking inflation. The S&P 500 plunged nearly 5% on April 3 for its worst day since the 2020 COVID crash. The very next day, it dropped 6% after China\u2019s response raised fears of a tit-for-tat trade war.",
      "The tariffs\u2019 impact went beyond the stock market. The value of the U.S. dollar fell, and fear even shook the U.S. Treasury market, which is seen as perhaps the safest in existence.",
      "Trump eventually put his tariffs on pause on April 9 after seeing the U.S. bond market get \u201cqueasy,\u201d as he put it, which sent relief through Wall Street. Since then, Trump has negotiated agreements with countries to lower his proposed tariff rates on their imports, helping calm investors\u2019 nerves.",
      "Wall Street motored higher through a remarkably calm summer thanks to euphoria around artificial-intelligence technology and strong profit reports from companies. The market also got a boost from three cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trade worries can still cause havoc in markets, and Trump sent stocks spiraling as recently as October with threats of higher tariffs on China.",
      "Another surprise was how hard, and how personally, Trump lobbied to get the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.",
      "The Fed has traditionally operated separately from the rest of Washington, making its decisions on interest rates without having to bend to political whims. Such independence, the thinking goes, gives it freedom to make unpopular moves that are necessary for the economy\u2019s long-term health.",
      "Keeping interest rates high, for example, could slow the economy and frustrate politicians looking to please voters. But it could also be the medicine needed to get high inflation under control.",
      "As inflation stubbornly remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the central bank kept rates steady through August. This drew Trump\u2019s ire \u2013 even though it was his own trade policies that were driving fears about inflation higher.",
      "Trump continuously picked on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, even giving him the nickname \u201cToo Late.\u201d Their tense relationship reached a head in July when Trump, in front of cameras, accused Powell of mismanaging the costs of a renovation of the Fed\u2019s headquarters. Powell, in turn, shook his head.",
      "Even though Wall Street loves lower rates, the personal attacks caused some queasiness in financial markets because of the possibility of a less independent Fed. Powell\u2019s turn as Fed chair is set to expire in May, and the wide expectation is that Trump will choose a replacement more likely to cut rates.",

Retail investors joined in by pouring money into bitcoin ETFs, stock-like investments that allowed them to benefit from the run-up in price without having to actually store bitcoin in digital wallets. Some companies, notably Strategy Inc., made buying and holding crypto the crux of their business and their stocks jumped.",
      "Bitcoin and hit a high around $125,000 in early October. But, almost as quickly, digital assets tanked  as investors worried the prices for shining stars such as tech stocks and crypto had jumped too high. As of Monday afternoon, bitcoin traded around $89,400, down roughly 28% from the peak and 4% below where it started the year.",
      "Many professional investors think more gains could be ahead in 2026.",
      "That\u2019s because most expect the economy to plod ahead and avoid a recession. That should help U.S. companies grow their profits, which stock prices tend to track over the long term. For companies in the S&P 500, analysts are expecting earnings per share to rise 14.5% in 2026, according to FactSet. That would be an acceleration from the 12.1% growth estimated for 2025.",
      "But some of this year\u2019s concerns will linger. Chief among them is the worry that all the investment in artificial-intelligence technology may not produce enough profits and productivity to make it worth it. That could keep the pressure on AI stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom, which were responsible for so much of the market\u2019s gains this year.",
      "And it\u2019s not just AI stocks that critics say are too pricey. Stocks across the market still look expensive after their prices climbed faster than profits.",
      "That has strategists at Vanguard estimating U.S. stocks may return only about 3.5% to 5.5% in annualized returns over the next 10 years. Only twice in the last 10 years has the S&P 500 failed to meet that bar, assuming this year ends without another sell-off.",
      "At Bank of America, strategist Savita Subramanian says the S& P 500 could rise by less than half as much as profits do in 2026. She said that could be a result of companies reducing stock buybacks, as well as global central banks implementing fewer rate cuts.",

      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",

      "Competition among retailers for a slice of the $129 billion U.S. beauty and personal care market is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce and the advice shoppers seek on social media instead of in stores",
      "NEW YORK -- It\u2019s shoppers like Quinn Kelsey who keep department store executives up at night.",
      "The 38-year-old Denver resident gets makeup ideas from TikTok videos and other social media content, not salespeople at beauty counters. She uses an AI chatbot to get product recommendations that fit her budget and to see how a certain foundation or lipstick would look on her. When she buys, it\u2019s usually from Amazon.",
      "\u201cI use Chat GPT as my personal beauty consultant,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cDepartment stores? I\u2019ll walk through one for the decor, but they\u2019ve basically lost me unless I can get the same product-research experience there that I can get scrolling through my phone at home.\u201d",
      "Once the ultimate beauty destination, department stores lost sales and their authority as skincare and makeup trendsetters starting in the late 1990s. That was when the growth of Sephora and Ulta Beauty made shopping for cosmetics more of a playful, self-service experience.",
      "But fast-changing consumer preferences have all types of retailers racing to outdo each other for a slice of the $129 billion U.S. beauty and personal care market. The competition is fiercer than ever due to the ease of e-commerce. Amazon, which has slowly added premium beauty brands to its massive selection, is the nation\u2019s largest online seller of beauty and personal care products, according to market research company Euromonitor International.",
      "Social media also has provided new sources of beauty guidance. Instead of store advisers, many consumers look to videos by influencers, beauty brand founders or dermatologists for advice.

      "\u201cStores are more of the showroom, but the spark itself is happening in TikTok,\u201d Jake Bjorseth, founder of the Generation Z advertising agency Trndsttrs, said.",
      "To keep up, companies with both physical and online stores are investing in upgrades that are meant to give beauty fans like Kelsey an experience they can\u2019t get anywhere else. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, renovated the beauty floors of their flagship New York stores to add more space, ultra-luxury brands and cutting-edge technology. At Nordstrom, customers can book an appointment to get robot-applied eyelash extensions for $170.",

      "Fragrances of all kinds and prices also have taken off as a popular purchase, outperforming sales of makeup and skincare in the first nine months of the year, the firm said.",
      "However, many shoppers don't want to get spritzed while wandering through a department store and don't want a salesperson's help picking out a perfume for loved ones or themselves. They may know what they want from hearing about social media trends like \u201cfragrance layering.\u201d Some enthusiasts collect scents like they might handbags and trust their own noses.",

Remember the old sales adage about the importance of direct eye contact. It's more crucial than ever since many customers will be wearing earbuds or headphones and might not hear a spoken invitation to sample products.",
      "If customers stop by the counter, ask if they want help. If they say no, let them explore and don't be pushy. They often start asking questions if you let them linger a while, Dervil said.",

In Dior's J'Adore line, the favorite version is the \u201ceau de parfum,\" Dervil said. If a customer think that's too strong or too light, direct them accordingly, she advised.",
      "I also learned that going up or down the spectrum doesn't always mean a more diffused or intense version of the same scent. It may lead to a different smell altogether.",
      "For example, the \u201cparfum d\u2019eau\u201d form of J'Adore smelled like a lighter version of the \u201ceau de parfum.\u201d But the line's lightest scent, J'Adore Eau Lumiere, had a citrusy scent that was totally different.",

      "Start asking open-ended questions about what they like or don't like about the scent. If they want to try other products, fold the strip and place it next to the just-sampled fragrance as a reminder of which one it was.",
      "If they're switching from scent to scent, ask them to sniff their arm or the back of their hand to clear their nostrils for the next one, Dervil said.",
      "If a customer likes a scent, discuss prices and bottle sizes, and hope to complete the sale.",

      "NEW YORK -- Consumers stepped up their spending, particularly on items like gadgets and clothing, for the first seven weeks of the holiday shopping period. But the pace was slower than a year ago amid worries about higher prices and other economic concerns, according to new data from Visa released Tuesday.",
      "From Nov. 1 through Sunday, holiday sales rose 4.2%, a slower clip from the 4.8% increase during the same period a year ago, according to the company's Visa Consulting & Analytics division, which analyzed a subset of Visa payments network data in the U.S.",
      "The figure includes all methods of payment including cash and card.",
      "The data, which exclude sales from auto dealerships, gas stations, and restaurants, are not adjusted for inflation including the impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "When adjusted, retail sales rose a more modest 2.2% for that time frame, according to Visa's principal U.S. economist Michael Brown. That compares to the inflation-adjusted 3% sales gain last year.",
      "\u201cIt's certainly not a spectacular season,\u201d Brown told The Associated Press. \"It's sort of an average holiday season given concerns about macro economic growth, inflation. There's still a lot of uncertainty among the consumer population.\"",
      "Retailers have described shoppers as being selective when making holiday purchases, choosing to focus on gifts for under the tree instead of holiday decor like ornaments for the tree, for example. Many households are struggling with higher prices in groceries, rent and imported goods hit by tariffs. The latest job report, released by the Labor Department last week, also shows a souring employment picture.",
      "As a result, consumers' mood has been gloomy, though it improved last month as worries about inflation eased a bit, according to the University of Michigan.",
      "When all the numbers are in, Visa expects holiday sales data will more or less be in line with its prediction of a 4.6% sales increase for the November and December period combined.",
      "Still to come are several of the holiday shopping season's top 10 busiest days including Tuesday, the day after Christmas and the Saturday after Christmas, according to Sensormatic, which tracks retail foot traffic.",
      "The Visa data is in line with the forecast from the National Retail Federation, the nation's largest retail industry trade group. It expects sales over November and December of between $1.01 trillion and $1.02 trillion. That would be up 3.7% to 4.2% over last year.",

A big drag on October data was a drop in sales at motor vehicles and auto parts dealerships, hurt by the expiration of federal government subsidies that sliced demand for battery-powered electric cars.",
      "According to Visa, e-commerce sales rose 7.8% for the first seven weeks of the period, fueled by promotions that started early in the season.",
      "Still, shopping at physical stores dominates \u2014 73% of holiday payment volume was in physical stores, while 27% of retail spending happened online, Visa said.",

      "Electronics have emerged as the hottest category, with sales rising 5.8% during this time frame, fueled in part by devices, powered by artificial intelligence, Visa said.",

      "Clothing and accessories sales accelerated at a 5.3% pace from Nov. 1 through Dec. 21 from a 4.1% increase last year.

      "Masashi \u201cJumbo\u201d Ozaki, whose 113 worldwide victories were the most of any player from Japan, died Wednesday in his home country after a battle with colon cancer, the Japan Golf Tour said. He was 78.",
      "Ozaki was revered in Japan, a big hitter with a sense of style who won 94 times over 29 years on the Japan Golf Tour, the last one coming at the 2002 ANA Open when he was 55.",
      "He rose to No. 5 in the world ranking in 1996 at age 49. Ozaki often got overlooked for never winning outside Japan except for the New Zealand PGA Championship. He was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 2011.",
      "\u201cHe is an indispensable, one-of-a-kind figure in discussing men\u2019s golf, both now and in the future,\u201d the tour said in a social media post.",
      "Ozaki competed in 49 majors, his best finish coming in the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill when he finished three shots behind Curtis Strange. He played the Masters for the 19th and final time in 2000 when he was 53 and tied for 28th.",
      "Isao Aoki was the first Japanese player in the World Golf Hall of Fame, and Hideki Matsuyama became the first to win a major at the 2021 Masters. Both were inspired in some fashion by Ozaki, the pioneer in a nation now obsessed with golf.",
      "Ozaki won the Japan Open five times and the Japan PGA Championship six times. He led the Japan Golf Tour money list a record 12 times, including five in a row from 1994 through 1998. He won his final money title in 2002, when he was 55.",
      "When he was inducted into the Hall of Fame, Ozaki said his one regret was not playing more outside of Japan.",
      "\u201cBut I dedicated my life to Japanese golf and am extremely grateful the voters thought I was worthy of this honor,\u201d he said upon his election. He received 50% of the vote on the International ballot.",
      "Ozaki was looked upon as the Arnold Palmer of golf in Japan with his powerful swing, charisma and sense of style, often wearing silk shirts and baggy pants. And his skill was not limited to just golf. He played the guitar and had three songs reach the pop charts in Japan, according to the Hall of Fame.",
      "His first love was baseball, and he spent three years pitching professionally before turning to golf. That was evident when Ryo Ishikawa, who won his first Japan Golf Tour title at age 15, spoke of Ozaki\u2019s influence. Ishikawa said he would visit Ozaki about 10 times a year to get advice.",

      "Ozaki traveled with an entourage when he did play outside Japan in the majors, usually renting a house and brining a sushi chef so his people would feel at home.",
      "He has two younger brothers who also played on tour, Naomichi (Joe) and Tateo (Jet).",
      "Ozaki played in the 1996 Presidents Cup, partnering with Vijay Singh to beat the American duo of Fred Couples and Davis Love III. He qualified for the 1998 team but decided against the trip to Australia, and his brother Joe played instead.",

      "Lawyers for Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season",
      "NEW YORK -- Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier \u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to throw out sports gambling charges that have kept him off the court this season, arguing that the government overreached by turning a private dispute over bettors\u2019 use of nonpublic information into a federal case.",
      "In a motion to dismiss made public on Tuesday, Rozier\u2019s lawyers argued that the government\u2019s theory of the case \u2014 that he prevented sportsbooks from making informed decisions about accepting certain bets \u2014 runs afoul of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the federal wire fraud statute.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn allege that Rozier, 31, helped gamblers cash in by tipping off a friend that he would leave a March 2023 game early because of a supposed injury. The friend, Deniro \u201cNiro\u201d Laster, who is also charged, shared or sold the information to others, who placed more than $250,000 in prop bets, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cThe government has billed this case as involving \u2018insider betting\u2019 and \u2018rigging\u2019 professional basketball games,\" Rozier\u2019s lawyers, James M. Trusty and A. Jeff Ifrah, wrote in the motion. \u201cBut the indictment alleges something less headline-worthy: that some bettors broke certain sportsbooks\u2019 terms of use against wagering based on non-public information and \u2018straw betting.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rozier was on the Charlotte Hornets at the time and the information about his early exit was not listed on the team\u2019s injury report, nor was it shared with the public or the sportsbooks that accept wagers on NBA games and player performances, prosecutors said.",
      "Rozier pleaded not guilty on Dec. 8 to wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy charges. He was released on $3 million bond and is due back in court for a hearing before U.S. District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall on March 3.",
      "His charges were part of a sweep of more than 30 other people in a takedown of two sprawling gambling operations: one that authorities said leaked inside information about NBA athletes and another involving rigged, Mafia-backed poker games.",
      "The charges have raised questions about the integrity of NBA games in an era of legalized betting and myriad prop bets, prompting the league to tweak its injury reporting requirements.",

      "In the motion, Rozier\u2019s lawyers wrote that under the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in United States v. Ciminelli, prosecutors can't make a wire fraud case out of allegations that defendants conspired to deprive a person \u2014 or, in this case, sportsbooks \u2014 of the right to information needed to make discretionary economic decisions.",
      "They also questioned whether federal prosecutors have the authority to bring such a case, since sportsbooks are regulated at the state level, not the federal level.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security is replacing its lottery system for H-1B visas with a new approach prioritizing skilled, higher-paid foreign workers",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday it was replacing its longstanding lottery system for H-1B work visas with a new approach that prioritizes skilled, higher-paid foreign workers.",
      "The change follows a series of actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping a visa program that critics say has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay, but supporters say drives innovation.",
      "\u201cThe existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,\u201d said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 annual H-1B visa fee on highly skilled workers, which is being challenged in court. The president also rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals.",
      "A press release announcing the new rule says it is \u201cin line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the Presidential Proclamation that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\u201d",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.",

It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season.",
      "Supporters of the H-1B program say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the U.S. and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.",
      "Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.",
      "The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master\u2019s degree or higher.",

      "NATO-nation intelligence services believe Russia is developing a weapon to target Starlink satellites",
      "Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.",
      "Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called \u201czone-effect\u201d weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.",
      "Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.",
      "Such repercussions, including risks to its own space systems, could steer Moscow away from deploying or using such a weapon, analysts said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t buy it. Like, I really don\u2019t,\u201d said Victoria Samson, a space-security specialist at the Secure World Foundation who leads the Colorado-based nongovernmental organization\u2019s annual study of anti-satellite systems. \u201cI would be very surprised, frankly, if they were to do something like that.\u201d",
      "But the commander of the Canadian military's Space Division, Brig. Gen. Christopher Horner, said such Russian work cannot be ruled out in light of previous U.S. allegations that Russia also has been pursuing an indiscriminate nuclear, space-based weapon.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been briefed on that type of system. But it\u2019s not implausible,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the reporting on the nuclear weapons system is accurate and that they\u2019re willing to develop that and willing to go to that end, well it wouldn\u2019t strike me as shocking that something just short of that, but equally damaging, is within their wheelhouse of development.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn't respond to messages from the AP seeking comment. Russia has previously called for United Nations efforts to stop the orbital deployment of weapons and President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has no intention of deploying nuclear space weapons.",
      "The intelligence findings were shown to the AP on condition that the services involved were not identified and the news organization was not able to independently verify the findings' conclusions.",
      "The U.S. Space Force didn't respond to e-mailed questions. The French military's Space Command said in a statement to the AP that it could not comment on the findings but said, \u201cWe can inform you that Russia has, in recent years, been multiplying irresponsible, dangerous, and even hostile actions in space.\u201d",
      "Russia views Starlink in particular as a grave threat, the findings indicate. The thousands of low-orbiting satellites have been pivotal for Ukraine\u2019s survival against Russia's full-scale invasion, now in its fourth year.",
      "Starlink's high-speed internet service is used by Ukrainian forces for battlefield communications, weapons targeting and other roles and by civilians and government officials where Russian strikes have affected communications.",
      "Russian officials repeatedly have warned that commercial satellites serving Ukraine's military could be legitimate targets. This month, Russia said it has fielded a new ground-based missile system, the S-500, which is capable of hitting low-orbit targets.",
      "Unlike a missile that Russia tested in 2021 to destroy a defunct Cold War-era satellite, the new weapon in development would target multiple Starlinks at once, with pellets possibly released by yet-to-be launched formations of small satellites, the intelligence findings say.",
      "Canada's Horner said it is hard to see how clouds of pellets could be corralled to only strike Starlink and that debris from such an attack could get \u201cout of control in a hurry.\u201d",
      "\"You blow up a box full of BBs,\u201d he said. Doing that would \u201cblanket an entire orbital regime and take out every Starlink satellite and every other satellite that\u2019s in a similar regime. And I think that\u2019s the part that is incredibly troubling.\u201d",
      "The findings seen by the AP didn't say when Russia might be capable of deploying such a system nor detail whether it has been tested or how far along research is believed to be.",
      "The system is in active development and information about the timing of an expected deployment is too sensitive to share, according to an official familiar with the findings and other related intelligence that the AP did not see. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the nonpublic findings.",

      "The intelligence findings say the pellets would be so small \u2014 just millimeters across \u2014 that they would evade detection by ground- and space-based systems that scan for space objects, which could make it hard to pin blame for any attack on Moscow.",
      "Clayton Swope, who specializes in space security and weaponry at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based security and policy think tank, said if \u201cthe pellets are not trackable, that complicates things\u201d but \u201cpeople would figure it out.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf satellites start winking out with damage, I guess you could put two and two together,\" he said.",

      "\u201cMost damage would probably be done to the solar panels because they\u2019re probably the most fragile part\u201d of satellites, Swope said. \u201cThat\u2019d be enough, though, to damage a satellite and probably bring it offline.\u201d",
      "After such an attack, pellets and debris would over time fall back toward Earth, possibly damaging other orbiting systems on their way down, analysts say.",
      "Starlink's orbits are about 550 kilometers (340 miles) above the planet. China\u2019s Tiangong space station and the International Space Station operate at lower orbits, \u201cso both would face risks,\u201d according to Swope.",
      "The space chaos that such a weapon could cause might enable Moscow to threaten its adversaries without actually having to use it, Swope said.",

      "The challenge for schools was highlighted this fall when AI-generated nude images swept through a Louisiana middle school. Two boys ultimately were charged, but not before one of the victims was expelled for starting a fight with a boy she accused of creating the images of her and her friends.",
      "\u201cWhile the ability to alter images has been available for decades, the rise of A.I. has made it easier for anyone to alter or create such images with little to no training or experience,\u201d Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre said in a news release. \u201cThis incident highlights a serious concern that all parents should address with their children.\u201d",

      "The prosecution stemming from the Louisiana middle school deepfakes is believed to be the first under the state\u2019s new law, said Republican state Sen. Patrick Connick, who authored the legislation.",
      "The law is one of many across the country taking aim at deepfakes. In 2025, at least half the states enacted legislation addressing the use of generative AI to create seemingly realistic, but fabricated, images and sounds, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some of the laws address simulated child sexual abuse material.",
      "Students also have been prosecuted in Florida and Pennsylvania and expelled in places like California. One fifth grade teacher in Texas also was charged with using AI to create child pornography of his students.",
      "Deepfakes started as a way to humiliate political opponents and young starlets. Until the past few years, people needed some technical skills to make them realistic, said Sergio Alexander, a research associate at Texas Christian University who has written about the issue.",
      "\u201cNow, you can do it on an app, you can download it on social media, and you don\u2019t have to have any technical expertise whatsoever,\u201d he said.",

      "Sameer Hinduja, the co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center, recommends that schools update their policies on AI-generated deepfakes and get better at explaining them.

      "Instacart is ending a program where customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store",
      "NEW YORK -- Instacart said Monday that it\u2019s ending a program where some customers saw different prices for the same product ordered at the same time from the same store when using the delivery company\u2019s service.",
      "The program was meant to help grocers and other retailers learn more about what kinds of prices customers would pay for items, similar to how stores offer different prices for the same products at different locations. But it raised alarms after a report from Consumer Reports and two progressive advocacy groups, Groundwork Collaborative and More Perfect Union, said Instacart offered nearly three out of every four grocery items to shoppers at multiple prices in an experiment.",
      "\u201cAt a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart,\u201d the company said in a Monday blog post. \u201cThat\u2019s not okay \u2013 especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\u201d",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said, but \u201cfrom now on, Instacart will not support any item price testing services.\u201d",
      "Instacart said these services were neither \u201c dynamic pricing,\u201d a system where the price for something can go up when demand is high, nor \u201csurveillance pricing,\u201d where prices can be set based on a user's income, shopping history or other personal information. Instead, the company said it was offered to customers at random.",
      "Some customers would simply see a slightly higher price for an item, while others would see a slightly lower price. The experiment by Consumer Reports and the two progressive advocacy groups, for example, found that Instacart customers saw one of five different prices for the same dozen of Lucerne eggs from a Safeway store in Washington, D.C.: $3.99, $4.28, $4.59, $4.69, or $4.79.",

      "Christian influencers are reaching hundreds of thousands of young people online",
      "ATLANTA -- Millennial and Generation Z Christian influencers are increasingly filling a void in American religion, growing audiences across digital platforms by steering young people to biblical answers to tough questions that aren't always answered in Sunday sermons.",
      "\u201cI can be that in-between \u2014 Monday to Saturday help \u2014 to give you practical things to make you feel like you\u2019re not walking this walk alone,\u201d said Megan Ashley, 35, sitting cross-legged in sweats on the couch where she records her \u201cIn Totality\u201d podcast.",
      "From myriad backgrounds, these influencers talk candidly to their listeners about everything from anxieties and doubts to dating and culture, delving into the Bible\u2019s complexities. Those of faith say Christian influencers are galvanizing young people looking for meaning in a culture that lacks it at a time when years of declining church attendance has slowed.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re making accessible is a truth that transforms people,\u201d said Lecrae Moore, a Christian rapper and podcaster. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s happening existentially \u2014 supernaturally \u2014 that I can\u2019t explain.\u201d",
      "Ashley and Moore are among a half-dozen popular influencers who described their work for this story. With and without formal theological they training, they describe themselves as churchgoers who don\u2019t want their messages boxed in by denominational labels.",
      "Some grew up in church; others didn\u2019t, but they commonly describe experiencing a spiritual transformation that came out of hardship or a sense of emptiness they pin on secular lifestyles.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like, listen, we\u2019re two mess-ups too. It\u2019s OK,\u201d said Arielle Reitsma, 36, co-host of podcast \u201cGirls Gone Bible,\u201d which gets more than a million listens or streams each month.",
      "These algorithm-savvy podcasters fit comfortably in a long tradition of Christian celebrities, said Zachary Sheldon, a Baylor University lecturer on media, religion and culture who cited televangelist Billy Graham as an example. Working independently, they can harness audiences more easily than established congregations and media organizations can.",
      "\u201cExposing people to the faith and challenging them to ask questions and search for something more\u201d are really good things to do, Sheldon said. But he pointed to \u201cpotential dangers in granting them too much authority on the basis of their celebrity and their acumen with social media.\u201d",
      "These influencers encourage church attendance and describe reaching a variety of people, including those who have been particularly disconnected from religion, which polls show is a growing number of young Americans. Only 41% of people ages 18-35 surveyed in 2023-24 said they believe in God with certainty, down from 65% in 2007, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cPeople are spiritually hungry, emotionally hungry, and I think for the first time ever \u2026 people are encountering Jesus even through online platforms, and they\u2019re realizing, this is true life and fulfillment,\u201d said Angela Halili, 29, Reitsma's co-host.",
      "The pair now draws live crowds since starting the podcast more than two years ago. At an event in Atlanta, they warned hundreds of fans against idolizing work or relationships, Bibles in hand, and recounted their days as Hollywood actors battling addiction, heartbreak and mental health disorders. Halili said God brought them \u201cradical healing,\u201d and they want listeners to know that God can perform \u201cmiracles\u201d in their lives, too.",
      "Afterward, they hugged and prayed for people in the audience, where Anna Williams, 17, said she considers both Reitsma and Halili to be \u201ca big sister\u201d in her life.",
      "Even as they espouse biblical principles as guidance toward true joy, influencers say that being Christian can be hard.",
      "God \u201cdoes make everything better, but that doesn\u2019t always come in the way that we think it\u2019s gonna come,\u201d said \u201cIn Totality\u201d host Ashley.",
      "Her current obsession, which she teaches with fervor, is a biblical passage about living as a sacrifice. God asks people to give up certain wants and behaviors so they can grow closer to him, Ashley says. She said her intensity grew after a healing encounter with God\u2019s \u201cseverity\u201d as a freshly divorced single mom plagued by suicidal thoughts and depression.",
      "Bible passages, day-to-day plights and heavier challenges are covered on \u201cWith the Perrys,\u201d a podcast led by husband and wife authors and spoken-word artists who also run a streetwear brand.",

      "\u201cMy issue with \u2018repent or burn in hell\u2019 is that people get frustrated because they don\u2019t know why you\u2019re telling them that,\u201d said Crawford, who describes being severely anxious and bitter toward God until God healed him at a Waffle House. \u201cOur tactics have been one-on-one conversations, calmly listening, asking questions because we care about them, and in that explaining our worldview.\u201d",
      "These influencers acknowledge that online Christianity has its challenges.",
      "A hyperfocus on online drama and Christianity's more esoteric beliefs can miss the basics, such as love and Christ's sacrifice, Hill Perry said. She worries that \u201csimply talking about gentleness or respect or kindness or patience is gonna be boring\u201d to people.",
      "And the deep political and cultural rifts among Christians emerge online too.",
      "For example, Halili and Reitsma got pushback for taking the opportunity to pray at a pre-inauguration rally for President Donald Trump. The Perrys have been criticized by conservatives for talking about police brutality and racial injustice, and liberals for expressing opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "Some followers say these influencers provide a welcome alternative to the buttoned-up pastors they grew up with who spoke of God as a faraway deity that would reject them for breaking too many rules.",
      "\u201cI really needed someone who was a younger Black female portraying something that wasn\u2019t super traditional,\u201d said Olivia Singleton, 24.

After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China\u2019s ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law\u2019s January 2025 deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S.",

      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways",
      "Every animal with a brain needs sleep \u2014 and even a few without a brain do, too. Humans sleep, birds sleep, whales sleep and even jellyfish sleep.",
      "Sleep is universal \u201ceven though it\u2019s actually very risky,\u201d said Paul-Antoine Libourel, a researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon in France.",
      "When animals nod off, they're most vulnerable to sneaky predators. But despite the risks, the need for sleep is so strong that no creature can skip it altogether, even when it's highly inconvenient.",
      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways \u2014 for example, stealing seconds at a time during around-the-clock parenting, getting winks on the wing during long migrations and even dozing while swimming.",
      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that sleep is really flexible in response to ecological demands,\u201d said Niels Rattenborg, an animal sleep research specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Germany.",
      "Call it the emerging science of \u201cextreme sleep.\u201d",
      "Take chinstrap penguins in Antarctica that Libourel studies.",
      "These penguins mate for life and share parenting duties \u2014 with one bird babysitting the egg or tiny gray fluffy chick to keep it warm and safe while the other swims off to fish for a family meal. Then they switch roles \u2014 keeping up this nonstop labor for weeks.",
      "Penguin parents face a common challenge: getting enough sleep while keeping a close eye on their newborns.",
      "They survive by taking thousands of catnaps a day \u2014 each averaging just 4 seconds long.",
      "These short \u201cmicrosleeps,\" as Korea Polar Research Institute biologist Won Young Lee calls them, appear to be enough to allow penguin parents to carry out their caregiving duties for weeks within their crowded, noisy colonies.",
      "When a clumsy neighbor passes by or predatory seabirds are near, the penguin parent blinks to alert attention and soon dozes off again, its chin nodding against its chest, like a drowsy driver.",
      "The naps add up. Each penguin sleeps for a total of 11 hours per day, as scientists found by measuring the brain activity of 14 adults over 11 days on Antarctica's King George Island.",
      "To remain mostly alert, yet also sneak in sufficient winks, the penguins have evolved an enviable ability to function on extremely fractured sleep \u2014 at least during the breeding season.",
      "Researchers can now see when either hemisphere of the brain \u2014 or both at once \u2014 are asleep.",
      "Poets, sailors and birdwatchers have long wondered whether birds that fly for months at a time actually get any winks on the wing.",

      "In some cases, the answer is yes \u2014 as scientists discovered when they attached devices that measure brain-wave activity to the heads of large seabirds nesting in the Galapagos Islands called great frigatebirds.",
      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",
      "On land, life is easy for a 5,000-pound (2,268-kilogram) northern elephant seal. But at sea, sleep is dangerous \u2014 sharks and killer whales that prey on seals are lurking.",
      "These seals go on extended foraging trips, for up to eight months, repeatedly diving to depths of several hundred feet (meters) to catch fish, squid, rays and other sea snacks.",
      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "NEW YORK -- The last major meteor shower of the year, known as the Ursids, peaks soon, bringing glowing streaks to nighttime and early morning skies. Compared to other meteor showers, it's more subdued, but experts say it's still worth a glimpse.",
      "Meteor showers happen when space rocks hit Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, gaining fiery tails \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d Random meteors are visible from Earth on any given clear night, but more predictable meteor showers happen yearly when Earth passes through streams of cosmic leftovers from comets or asteroids.",
      "The Ursids peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will be visible until Dec. 26 from the Northern Hemisphere. Skygazers usually see five to 10 meteors per hour during the height and there's a possibility for outbursts of up to 25 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "How active a shower will appear from Earth depends on the amount of debris and the moon's brightness, which can blot out glowing meteors. The Ursids feature less space debris than other showers like the Geminids, but the narrow crescent moon won't be much of an obstacle when they peak.",

      "The lower house of parliament passed the legislation Wednesday and the upper house on Thursday. It now needs the assent from the Indian president, which is a formality, to come into force.",
      "The move carries global significance as India seeks to position itself as a major player in the next wave of nuclear energy, including with small modular reactors at a time many nations are reassessing nuclear power to meet climate targets and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.",
      "Supporters argue the legislation marks a decisive break from decades of state dominance in nuclear energy while critics say it opens the door to risks, mainly health hazards, that could have long term consequences.",
      "\u201cIt marks a momentous milestone for India and signals capable private sector players that the country is open for business in the nuclear energy space,\u201d said Karthik Ganesan, director of strategic partnerships at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a think tank.",
      "Junior Minister Jitendra Singh, who oversees the department of atomic energy, told lawmakers that the bill \u2014 which has been dubbed Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India \u2014 seeks to modernize India\u2019s nuclear framework in line with technological, economic and energy realities. It also retains and strengthens core safety, security and regulatory safeguards.",
      "\u201cIndia\u2019s role in geopolitics is increasing. And if we have to be a global player effectively, we have to live up to global benchmarks, follow global parameters and adopt global strategies,\u201d Singh said in the lower house, adding that the legislation was necessary to address the country\u2019s growing energy needs.",
      "India wants more nuclear power and has pledged over $2 billion in recent months toward research and allied activities. Nuclear power is a way to make electricity that doesn\u2019t emit planet-warming gases, although it does create radioactive waste.",
      "India is one of the world\u2019s biggest emitters of planet-heating gases and over 75% of its power is still generated by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal. India wants to install 100 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2047 \u2014 enough to power nearly 60 million Indian homes a year.",
      "Energy experts say that for the world to move away from carbon-polluting fuels like coal, oil and gas, sources like nuclear that don\u2019t rely on the sun and the wind \u2014 which aren\u2019t always available \u2014 are needed. But some are skeptical about India\u2019s ambitions as the country\u2019s nuclear sector is still very small, and negative public perceptions about the industry remain.",

      "They pulled items from trash bins, which they say included listings for massages in New York, and lists of females with ages, descriptions and \"what they do.\"\u00a0 The investigators also researched phone and business records for Epstein and Maxwell.\u00a0 They tracked down other\u00a0students who said they'd been approached by Maxwell and who told police there was something \"weird\" about Epstein and Maxwell, but that they hadn't seen anything illegal, according to the report.",

      "Recent wildfire burn scar areas are especially prone to dangerous, flash flooding and could also trigger debris flows and mudslides.

      "\"With as much total rain as what we're expecting, widespread, significant flooding will likely occur in urban and poor drainage areas, especially in and around the higher terrain,\" National Weather Service at Oxnard Meteorologist-In-Charge Ariel Cohen said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. \"There will almost certainly be numerous rock slides and mudslides, along with areas of severe flooding in urban locations and along freeways, which is why being out on the roads will be exceptionally dangerous.\"",

      "Authorities say a prominent California farmer has been arrested on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife",
      "A prominent California farmer was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the shooting death of his estranged wife in a remote mountain community in Arizona, the Navajo County Sheriff's Office said.",
      "Michael Abatti, 63, was arrested in El Centro and booked into jail on a first-degree murder charge. He is awaiting extradition to Arizona.",
      "Authorities say they believe he drove to Arizona on Nov. 20 and fatally shot Kerri Ann Abatti, 59, before returning home to California. She was found dead in her family\u2019s tree-shrouded vacation home in Pinetop, Arizona, where she moved after splitting with her husband.",
      "An attorney for Michael Abatti didn\u2019t immediately respond to an email and text message seeking comment.",
      "Authorities searched his home in far Southern California on Dec. 2 as part of the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "El Centro is a city of 44,000 people just minutes from the Mexican border in the crop-rich Imperial Valley, which is the biggest user of Colorado River water and known for growing leafy greens, melons and forage crops.",
      "Michael Abatti comes from a long line of farmers in the region bordering Arizona, and his grandfather, an Italian immigrant, was among the region\u2019s early settlers. His father, Ben, helped start the Imperial Valley Vegetable Growers Association, and the Abatti name is known throughout the region and tied to farming enterprises, scholarship funds and leadership in local boards and groups.",
      "Michael Abatti has grown onions, broccoli, cantaloupes and other crops in the Imperial Valley and served on the board of the powerful Imperial Irrigation District from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Michael and Kerri Abatti were married in 1992 and had three children.",
      "Kerri Abatti is a descendant of one of the first Latter-day Saints families to settle Pinetop in the 1880s. The community, located 190 miles (305 kilometers) northeast of Phoenix in the White Mountains, was briefly called Penrodville after Kerri\u2019s forbearers before adopting the Pinetop name.",
      "The couple split in 2023 and Kerri Abatti filed for divorce in proceedings that were pending in California at the time of her death.",

They owned a large home in California, a vacation home in Pinetop and ranch land in Wyoming and vacationed in Switzerland, Italy and Hawaii while sending their children to private school, she said.",
      "After the split, Kerri was granted $5,000 a month in temporary spousal support but last year asked for an increase to $30,000, saying she couldn\u2019t maintain her standard of living as she quit her job as a bookkeeper and office manager for the family farm in 1999 to stay home with the couple\u2019s three children. Kerri, who previously held a real estate license in Arizona, also asked for an additional $100,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, court filings show.",
      "\u201cI am barely scraping by each month, am handling all of the manual labor on our large property in Arizona and continuing its upkeep,\u201d she wrote in court filings earlier this year, adding she was living near her elderly parents. Kerri said she also needed to buy a newer car because her 2011 vehicle had more than 280,000 miles (450,600 kilometers) on it and sorely needed repairs.",
      "Michael Abatti said in a legal filing that he couldn\u2019t afford the increase after two bad farming years took a toll on his monthly income. He said European shifts in crop-buying to support war-plagued Ukrainian farmers and rising shipping costs were to blame along with an unusually cold and wet winter.",
      "He said in mid-2024 it cost $1,000 to grow an acre of wheat that he could sell for $700, and that he was receiving about $22,000 a month to run the farm as the business struggled to pay its creditors in full.",
      "\u201cThe income available at this time does not warrant any increase in the amount to which the parties stipulated, let alone an increase to $30,000 per month,\u201d Lee Hejmanowski, Michael Abatti\u2019s family law attorney, wrote in court papers.",
      "Days later, Michael Abatti agreed to increase temporary spousal support payments to $6,400 a month, court filings show.",
      "He studied in the agricultural business management program at Colorado State University in Fort Collins before returning to California, according to a 2023 book about water issues written by his college friend, Craig Morgan, titled \u201cThe Morality of Deceit.\u201d",
      "In 2009, Michael Abatti almost died from an infection caused by a flesh-eating bacteria and was hospitalized and placed in a medically induced coma for treatment, Morgan wrote in the book.",

      "Geyser and Weier later told investigators they attacked Leutner in hopes of impressing Slender Man enough that he would make them his servants and wouldn't hurt their families. Both of them were eventually committed to the Winnebago Mental Health Institute \u2014 Geyser for 40 years and Weier for 25 years.",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge gave a green light Tuesday to New York\u2019s so-called Green Light Law, rejecting the Trump administration\u2019s bid to stop the state from giving people driver's licenses without having them prove they are in the country legally.",
      "U.S. District Judge Anne M. Nardacci in Albany ruled that the Republican administration \u2014 which challenged the law under President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 had failed to support its claims that the state law usurps federal law or that it unlawfully regulates or unlawfully discriminates against the federal government.",
      "The Justice Department sued the state over the law in February, naming Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, as defendants. At a news conference announcing the lawsuit, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused the officials, both Democrats, of prioritizing \u201cillegal aliens over American citizens.\u201d",

Rather, she said in a 23-page opinion, it was to assess whether the Trump administration\u2019s arguments established that the law violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Supremacy Clause, which gives federal laws precedence over state laws.",

      "The Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.",
      "Under the law, people who don\u2019t have a valid Social Security number can submit alternative forms of ID that include valid passports and driver\u2019s licenses issued in other countries. Applicants must still get a permit and pass a road test to qualify for a \u201cstandard driver\u2019s license.\u201d It does not apply to commercial driver\u2019s licenses.",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit sought to strike down the law as \u201ca frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\u201d It highlighted a provision that requires the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.",
      "In 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term, his administration sought to pressure New York into changing the law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.",
      "The governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn\u2019t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residency in the U.S. The administration ultimately restored New Yorkers\u2019 access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.",
      "In the lawsuit rejected Tuesday, the administration argued that it could be easier to enforce federal immigration priorities if federal authorities had unfettered access to New York\u2019s driver information. Nardacci, echoing a 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in a county clerk\u2019s earlier challenge to the law, wrote that such information \u201cremains available to federal immigration authorities\u201d through a lawful court order or judicial warrant.",

A clip from the documentary shows O'Day reading from an affidavit that describes an alleged sexual assault involving her, Combs, and another man while she was \"looking very inebriated.\" She says she has no memory of the alleged incident, but it has left her with questions.",
      "O'Day left with questions after shocking affidavit",
      "\"Does this mean I was raped? Is that what this means? I don't even know if I was raped. And I don't want to know,\" said O'Day in the documentary, which has received a reported 40 million views globally in its first two weeks.",

Combs is currently serving a 50-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being\u00a0convicted on prostitution-related charges.",

Speaking about Combs in the documentary brought up a lot of painful moments for O'Day, who said she's still processing the information.",

      "\"I forgive myself. That was the hard one,\" she said. \"The feelings that I've had throughout all of this really come down to, like, forgiving myself for misplacing abuse, or attention, or acknowledgment as love. Those weren't one in the same. And so I had to forgive myself first.\"",
      "Living her purpose",
      "When it comes to forgiving Combs, O'Day said it doesn't really matter.",

He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",

      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",

      "\"When they called my name, I looked over and Rob was standing and he was just pounding his fist together going, 'Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'\" she recalled.",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",

      "Annette Bening played Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist and love interest of widower President Andrew Shepherd, portrayed by Michael Douglas in the 1995 political romantic comedy, \"The American President.\" During filming, Bening said Reiner made it a priority as the movie's director to ensure the cast and crew could spend quality time with their families.",
      "\"On the set, he had that kind of enthusiasm that is infectious. The leader sets the tone, right? So he was wonderful that way. And a real avid family man,\" Bening said.",
      "She added, \"He would insist that the day ended at a sane time, which in show business is kind of unusual. But, he said, 'No, we want everyone to be able to have dinner with their kids.'\"",
      "Michael Douglas",
      "Like Reiner, Michael Douglas was also born to Hollywood royalty, the son of Kirk Douglas.",
      "\"Well, my experience was, watching him, that I could never be the man that my father was. He could do everything, you know, I mean he was Spartacus. Once you go into the same business, it stares you in the face,\" Douglas said. \"And, in Rob's case, are you as funny as your father? But that I think is also what created his tenacity, his strength, and that's something that's not really talked about enough with Rob, about his endurance.\"",

He said Reiner was like a father figure to him during that time, and the years after.",
      "Months after the movie came out, when he was 12 years old, O'Connell said Reiner took him out to lunch in Los Angeles.",
      "\"He took me out to lunch, man. He didn't have to do that, You know what I'm saying? It was months after the movie came out. He was a busy man, and he took a 12-year-old me out to lunch. Just to be like, 'Thanks so much. What a great movie,'\" O'Connell recalled, with tears in his eyes. \"That lunch meant so much to me, you know? It's just stuff that kids need to hear.\"",
      "Mandy Patinkin",
      "Mandy Patinkin played Inigo Montoya, a Spanish swordsman, in Reiner's 1987 film adaptation of \"The Princess Bride.\" It was the role of a lifetime.",
      "After wrapping up filming, Patinkin said the cast was invited to come out to Los Angeles to see the first rough cut together. When the film was over, Patinkin turned in the screening room and said he \"never dreamed\" he would get to be in something like this.",
      "\"I didn't even have time to dream it. And he made that dream for me. And I don't go anywhere, where some child or adult or grandfather comes up to me and says, 'Say the line,'\" said Patinkin of his famous line, \"Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "The word that came to min when Patinkin heard the news about Reiner and his wife, Michele: \"Inconceivable.\" He said he doesn't know how to process it and he's not looking to understand how to process it.",
      "\"Rob worked hard to try to get me the best human being I could be. One time he said to me, 'I just wish you could get out of your own way.' And I haven't been able to achieve that to this day, but I won't quit trying. He cared about my nature. He showed it to me over and over again,\" Patinkin said. \"I believe that we can connect with Rob and Michele. And every time we're thinking about this or talking about it or anybody tells a story, he's here. He's here with you. He will not be forgotten.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sean Ono Lennon has had a versatile career, as a musician, producer, and songwriter. Asked what part of the musical creation process he likes the most, Lennon replied, \"That's easy: I love writing and recording, and I hate finishing.\"",
      "With his mother, Yoko Ono, now in her 90s, he's added a new job: the custodian of his father's legacy. \"Yeah, technically,\" he said, \"but obviously the world is also the custodian of his legacy, I would say. I'm just doing my best to help make sure that the younger generation doesn't forget about The Beatles and John and Yoko. That's how I look at it.\"",
      "\"Do you think that's even possible?\" I asked.",
      "\"To forget about it? I do, actually,\" Lennon said. \"And I never did before.\"",
      "For his parents' classic, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over),\" Lennon looked for new ways for the song to be heard. \"I wanted to see if I could get that feeling of maybe it sounds like you're hearing it again for the first time, or at least in a new context, in a way that you'd pay attention, as opposed to, 'Oh, there it is on the radio again.'\"",
      "Lennon collaborated with former Pixar animator Dave Mullins to make a short film, \"War Is Over!\" \"We came up with this idea that two soldiers would be playing chess on opposite sides of a war,\" Lennon said. \"I'd also read an article that there were sort of heroic messenger pigeons from World War I and World War II.\"",
      "The 11-minute film, now on YouTube, won an Academy Award last year for best animated short. \"It felt like a Miss Universe pageant or something,\" Lennon said, \"and I was just standing there kind of crying.\"",
      "He used the moment to shout-out his mom: \"So, could everyone please say, 'Happy Mother's Day, Yoko!'\"",
      "\"It's a personal thing\"",
      "Lennon said, \"My parents gave me so much that I think it's the least I can do to try and support their legacy in my lifetime. I feel like I just owe it to them. It's a personal thing.\"",
      "What does he see is their legacy? \"Peace and love,\" he said. \"But it's not just peace and love. It's an attitude towards activism that is done with humor and love.\"",
      "That attitude is visible in the new HBO documentary \"One to One,\" about John and Yoko's 1972 benefit concert at Madison Square Garden \u2013 the only concert John and Yoko had done together. \"The only full-length concert,\" Lennon said, \"certainly the only concert I think that he played a Beatles song, too (\"Come Together\"), because I think he was just in a good mood.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"One to One,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The concert occurred during Lennon's first years in New York, when he was fighting a bitter deportation battle with the Nixon administration, in part because of his anti-war activism.",
      "Featured in the film, said Lennon, were recordings he'd never heard: \"They found these phone calls that my parents had recorded of themselves which, interestingly, was a response to the FBI tapping their phones. So, they thought, 'Well, we need to tap our own phones. Because if they try to say we said something that we didn't say, we'll have our own record of it.'\"",
      "The documentary captures John and Yoko at a critical time in their lives. \"Yeah, and you know, it's my origin story actually,\" said Lennon. \"If you think about it, they came to New York, and that's the only reason I exist.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see something you maybe didn't see before? Or have you seen it all before?\"",
      "\"I hadn't seen all of the home video footage in 'One to One,'\" he said. \"I hadn't heard those phone recordings before. It's like getting more moments to spend with my dad. So actually, for me on a personal level, it just really means a lot.\"",
      "Sean produced the music (also released as a box set). He's working on his own new album, too, his third with the Claypool Lennon Delirium, which he describes as \"kind of a whimsical prog rock, experimental psych band. It's fun!\"",
      "The Claypool Lennon Delirium performs \"Blood and Rockets\":",
      "Lennon and James McCartney (Paul's son) have also been working on a new song with Zak Starkey (Ringo's son), kindling hopes that the \"Children of the Beatles\" might unite.",
      "Asked if they've been offered a gig to play together, Lennon replied, \"Sure. I think people ask for that a lot, but I do think that would be ridiculous. But you know, the reason Zak and James and I made a song together is not because we're trying to redo The Beatles, it's just because we like each other. We're not gonna do it because of some expectation or to, like, fulfill anyone's expectation of what we should do. It has to be natural.\"",
      "Sean Lennon takes his new responsibilities very seriously: \"I think the Beatles' music, and John and Yoko's legacy, is something important for the world to kind of cherish and be reminded of. So, that's how I see my job.\"",
      "Asked how his mother is doing, Lennon said, \"She's good. I mean, you know, she's 92, so she's slowed down a lot, and she's retired. That's why I'm kind of trying to do the work that she used to do. That's why I feel a lot of pressure, actually, to do my best, because she set a high standard for the way that she dealt with my dad's music, and the Beatles stuff. She's always been very singular. And I think my dad was less so. You know, he had Paul to write with, and then he was hoping that my mom would kind of be a writing partner. And I just think it's really funny that, you know, there's probably only one person in the world who would turn down John Lennon as a writing partner, and that's my mom, you know?\"",
      "\"That's probably why he liked her,\" I said.",

    "story": [
      "\"A cappella\" means singing without instruments. But we've come a very long way from monks chanting, to Pentatonix, an a cappella quintet that's won three Grammys and sold 10 million albums. YouTube fans have played their videos more than six billion times.",
      "\"We've just blended together throughout the years just because of how long we've been together,\" said Kirstin Maldonado.",
      "And three of the singers\u2014Maldonado, Scott Hoying and Mitch Grassi\u2014have been together a very long time. \"Mitch and I were in a show together when we were ten,\" said Hoying. \"I met Kirsti in freshman English when we were 14!\"",
      "At their high school in Arlington, Texas, they formed a trio: a soprano, a baritone, and a countertenor. Grassi said of his voice, \"It is incredibly high, and it got made fun of a lot while I was growing up. Yeah, growing up in Texas, you know, it was very different and it's a little feminine, so it was like, 'Get him outta here.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"Our different timbres make such a specific sound when the frequencies of our voices come together, like they all play such a vital role. When they're all together, it feels like this hug. It's really magical, actually.\"",
      "In 2011, they decided to try out for NBC's a cappella competition show \"The Sing-Off.\" But when they learned that bigger groups had better chances, they added a bass, Avi Kaplan, and wanted to add a beatboxer. Hoying said, \"And so, in an act of desperation, we literally went on YouTube and typed in 'beatboxers.' The first video to pop up was a video of Kevin playing cello and beatboxing at the same time.\"",
      "It was Kevin Olusola\u2014cellist, singer, beatboxer, and pre-med student at Yale. Asked what his parents had to say when he quit pre-med to become a musician, Olusola replied, \"It was definitely not the plan!\"",
      "They not only made it onto \"Sing-Off,\" they won the grand prize: $200,000 and a record deal. But within a month, the record company dropped them. Olusola said, \"They asked us, 'Hey, will you guys put any instrumentation behind what you all do?' And we said, 'We literally just won an a cappella TV show.'\"",
      "Hoying said, \"We were just like, 'No, we don't like that idea.' And they were like, 'Okay, then we'll drop you.'\"",
      "Instead, they turned to YouTube. Within a year, they had four million subscribers.",
      "\"The video that probably really broke us in terms of the industry would be 'Little Drummer Boy,'\" Olusola said. \"It went to Top 10 of iTunes for four weeks.\"",
      "The higher the Pentatonix star ascended, the harder they worked. Their behind-the-scenes sixth member, co-founder and producer Ben Bram, wrote ever-more spectacular vocal arrangements. Pentatonix released three albums in 2014 alone, and toured for nine months every year.",
      "\"You never got to recharge and be at home, or see your friends or your loved ones,\" said Maldonado. \"It was, like, really, really brutal.\"",
      "So brutal that, in 2017, Avi Kaplan made a stunning announcement: he decided to take a step back from Pentatonix.",
      "\"He didn't really want to tour; he didn't love the tour life,\" said Hoying. \"And we were in our prime and, like, really wanting to tour a lot.\"",
      "After a nationwide search, Pentatonix found its new bass: a Pentatonix superfan from Maryland named Matt Sallee. \"To be able to come into the group and to be able to continue its legacy was something that I cherish very deeply, and I took very seriously,\" Sallee said.",
      "He was prepared: \"I knew everything,\" he said. \"I, like, learned every song, every bass part of every song.\"",
      "\"We were so excited and relieved and grateful that, like, oh, we can see the vision for the future, we can keep this going\" Hoying said.",
      "And they did keep going.",
      "To hear Pentatonix perform \"O Holy Night\" click on the video player below:",
      "I asked, \"You guys have been together\u2014living, traveling, working\u2014for years. You can't tell me there aren't things about each of you that drive others of you crazy?\"",
      "\"Do we have time?\" Sallee replied.",
      "\"There's a lot. There's a lot,\" said Maldonado.",
      "Hoying said, \"We kind of lucked out that none of us are super-reactive.\"",
      "\"I don't think we all have, like, crazy egos that are, like, getting in the way of being able to communicate clearly with each other,\" Maldonado said.",
      "But after 14 years in the spotlight, change was inevitable. Olusola said, \"Everybody's now starting to get married, have kids. So now, what do we want in this stage?\"",
      "What they wanted was to focus on Christmas. Five of their last six albums have all been Christmas music, and their tour is decidedly a holiday show.",

    "summary": "Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz looks back at the work of actor and director Rob Reiner, whose films became part of our shared cinematic language because of their humor, drama, and aching belief in humanity.",
    "story": [
      "In the aftermath of the deaths last weekend of filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife Michele, Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz offers an appreciation of Reiner's unparalleled career and life in the movies:",
      "Rob Reiner entered America's collective consciousness in 1971, playing Mike Stivic, Archie Bunker's son-in-law, and politically liberal foil, on \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Mike: \"It's getting like politics in American is only for the rich.\" Archie: \"Who's been feeding you that commie crapola?\" Mike: \"President Eisenhower said that.\" Archie: \"He did not! Eisenhower was a great president who never said nothing.\"",
      "Even then, Reiner knew that, as good as he was in front of the camera, he wanted to direct. His feature debut as a director came in 1984 with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a parody of a documentary that delivered one of the funniest scenes in movie history:",
      "Nigel (Christopher Guest): \"This is very, very special. Because as you can see, the numbers all go to 11. Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11, 11.\"  Marty: (Reiner): \"And most amps go up to 10?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. \u2026 What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?\"Marty: \"Put it up to 11?\"Nigel: \"Exactly. One louder.\"Marty: \"Why don't you just make 10 louder, and make 10 be the top number, and make that a little louder?\"Pause.Nigel: \"These go to 11!\"",
      "\"Spinal Tap\" began an extraordinary run that rivals the best directors in Hollywood history: Seven classic films in just 11 years, each standing the test of time, each possessing some piece of authentic humanity.",
      "In \"Stand By Me,\" an aching moment of friendship between two boys.",
      "In \"The Princess Bride,\" a combination of everlasting love \u2026 and revenge.",
      "Inigo (Mandy Patinkin): \"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.\"",
      "Three of the movies Reiner made during that run of success contain scenes so perfectly shot, they've become part of our shared cinematic language. First came the diner scene in \"When Harry Met Sally.\" The scene required Meg Ryan to mimic a woman faking an orgasm. After one take, Reiner went to Ryan and explained what he wanted: louder, more hand movements, table pounding. The button on the scene came from Reiner's mother, Estelle: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "Next came Kathy Bates, giving an Oscar-winning performance in \"Misery.\" For the hobbling scene, Reiner gives us James Caan's perspective, tied to the bed, looking up at the benevolent mania of Bates' face.",
      "Finally, in \"A Few Good Men,\" Reiner did the seemingly impossible: directing Jack Nicholson to a performance as memorable as \"Chinatown,\" \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or \"The Shining.\" Reiner gave us a courtroom drama for the ages, and Nicholson an opportunity to shine in front of a new generation of movie lovers.",
      "Col. Jessup (Jack Nicholson): \"You want answers.\" Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise): \"I think I'm entitled.\" Jessup: \"You want answers?\" Kaffee: \"I want the truth.\" Jessup: \"You can't handle the truth.\"",
      "The truth about Rob Reiner is that, for many Americans, his politics were as well-known as his films, but not always as popular. A fierce critic of President Trump, there's no doubt millions of Americans disagreed (many strongly) with Reiner.",
      "But here's the thing we can all understand about him: Rob Reiner was a patriot, an American who believed deeply in humanity; who believed in trying to make his country work as well as possible for as many human beings as possible.",
      "You can see that aspirational political nature in the last movie of his remarkable run, \"The American President,\" in 1995:",
      "President Shepherd (Michael Douglas): \"You want to claim this land is the land of the free? Then the symbol of your country cannot just be a flag. The symbol also has to be one of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest. Now show me that, defend that, celebrate that in your classrooms. Then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free.\"",
      "There is no easy way to process the family tragedy that took Rob and Michele Reiner. It is awful. Period.",
      "The sense of loss is heightened by Rob's lofty standing in Hollywood. In a business that can induce backstabbing and produce enemies, Rob was nearly universally loved in the entertainment industry. I didn't know him as well as I would've liked, but he always made me feel like we'd been pals for decades.",
      "His character was defined by his kindness, his humor, his compassion, by his own humanity.",
      "Those are qualities that all of us love in his movies, films that maybe, in some small way, can help us find something that unites us in these unbelievably fractured times.",

    "summary": "Ted Koppel visits Seneca Falls, the Central New York town that's said to have inspired the 1946 Jimmy Stewart classic \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" a film that celebrates smalltown virtues and happy endings, and which still has a powerful hold on our imagination.",
    "story": [
      "There's a little town in Central New York that our old colleague, Bill Geist visited 14 years ago, when he said, \"On Christmas morning, what better place to be than Seneca Falls, N.Y.? The town loudly and proudly proclaims that it was the inspiration for the Christmas film classic 'It's a Wonderful Life.'\"",
      "And every year they have this festival celebrating the occasion. One visitor told us, \"Been waiting my whole life to come up here and see this. I believed in Santa Claus when I was a kid. And I believed in the movie.\"",
      "The movie's been around for almost 80 years now, but just in case you don't know the plot: Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, this sweetheart of a guy who runs a building and loan association in the town of Bedford Falls, just the soul of decency and kindness and selflessness. And then there's Lionel Barrymore. He's Mr. Potter, who runs the big bank in town, and he is none of those things.",
      "MR. POTTER: \"Are you running a business or a charity ward? Not with my money!\"",
      "In a nutshell, we get to see what the town would have been like if George Bailey hadn't ever existed \u2013 instead of Bedford Falls, we had Pottersville.",
      "It might have been just a little like this: A few weeks back at a Seneca Falls Town Board meeting, a local resident kept talking after debate had been shut down, and a board member, Frank Sinicropi, seemed to offer a drastic solution: \"Shoot him!\"",
      "He was just kidding, but he did tell the police chief to shoot one of the townspeople. Bad timing! After all, this was just a few weeks before all those tourists come pouring into town searching for the annual festival celebrating \"It's a Wonderful Life.\"",
      "Kevin McDonald wasn't born when the movie was made, but he lives and breathes the film's message: \"Especially this time of year,\" he said. \"The spirit. You can't be here and not smile.\"",
      "It's on a bridge just like this one that director Frank Capra brings his hero, George Bailey, to the brink of suicide, until he witnesses someone fall into the water \u2013 an angel who, by keeping George from suicide and getting him to perform a heroic rescue, will earn his wings.",
      "Locals believe it's based on a real rescue in 1917 in Seneca Falls. \"Somebody tried to end their life here,\" said McDonald.",
      "Enter Antonio Varacalli, who was on the shoreline when he saw the woman go into the water, and jumped in to save her. \"Got her to shore, and then he succumbed,\" McDonald said. \"He was an immigrant from Italy. We have a hero's celebration in April to honor him.\"",
      "\"It's kind of ironic, isn't it, in these times with what's happening to immigrants?\" I said.",
      "\"It sure is.\"",
      "But when this reporter visited the local cafe and talked about immigrants today being rounded up and sent overseas, not necessarily back to their own countries, one woman replied, \"You poor thing. You're gonna have a hard time this weekend, because everyone I've met today is gonna focus on the positive.\"",
      "\"Well, that's fine,\" I said. \"I've got no problem with you focusing on the positive; I'm just not gonna make it that easy for you. You're focusing on the positive, and I'm seeing a country that is getting caught up in the negative. You can't ignore that.\"",
      "Another woman, wearing angel wings, said, \"When you come to Seneca Falls, you get it. It's healing, and it's hope. I think that's one of the reasons we're so drawn to this movie, just to give ourselves back to kindness again.\"",
      "It's an inescapable message, even for Jimmy Hawkins and Karolyn Grimes, who played two of the Bailey children, Tommy and Zuzu, in the movie.",
      "Grimes admitted she didn't have many lines in the movie, but people hold onto her most famous one at the end: \"Daddy, Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.\"",
      "\"Everywhere she goes, right?\" Hawkins said.",
      "What's more, Grimes said, \"I believe it.\"",
      "\"Oh, do you?\"",
      "\"Oh, I do!\"",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" I said.",
      "\"Are you a cynic?\" Grimes asked.",
      "\"A cynic?\" I replied. \"I don't think you can be in my line of work for as many years as I have been without becoming a bit of a cynic!\"",
      "Well, for example, amid all that joyful spirit of kindness and civility hanging over Seneca Falls at this time of year, there is also THAT just looming over the edge of town: Seneca Meadows, the largest landfill in the Northeastern United States.",
      "Bill Lutz has a plant that packages bottles and containers for wineries and breweries in the shadow of Seneca Meadows: \"That hill is filled with all kinds of garbage and toxic chemicals and vapors that come off it on a daily basis,\" he said. \"We have a hard time not only retaining employees, but attracting new employees. It's definitely a challenge to try to get people that want to move here. And it certainly affects our business.\"",
      "Not surprisingly, Seneca Meadows told us they are a good neighbor who consistently meets or exceeds safety standards and regulations. In fact, that's part of their argument for why they should be allowed to expand.",
      "Lutz said, \"It was flat land not too many years ago, and now they're moving to an expansion that would take it another 15 years, and another 70 feet higher.\"",
      "Now, isn't that just the kind of thing that would've driven Jimmy Stewart's character, George Bailey, nuts?",
      "GEORGE BAILEY: \"You spin your little web and think the whole world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter!",
      "Lutz said, \"They've got plenty of money, lawyers to keep it going. It's a big Texas company, and they want to continue to grow it, because they can do it here, in a small town.\"",
      "In fact, that's what we have downtown: A small town, with a museum about a movie. Well, part of a movie \u2013 maybe not the part about what could happen to the town of Bedford Falls.",
      "\"People want to go back to simpler times,\" said Anwei Law, who created the \"It's a Wonderful Life\" Museum. \"This reminds them of that, and gives them the opportunity to do that for a short period of time.\"",
      "I asked Karolyn Grimes, \"What are we seeing today? Are we seeing a reflection of George Bailey's world? Or Mr. Potter's world?\"",
      "\"Oh, that's awfully touchy!\" she laughed. \"It's trying to be Mr. Potter's world, I think. But I think there's enough George Baileys out there that it's gonna balance their direction.\"",
      "Mr. Potter, a villain in the movie, seems to go unpunished, although Harold Buccholz, a student of the film, sees a greater message: \"We're a little bit surprised when George Bailey has his life back, and he's so excited to be alive again. And as he's running home he stops by the bank, he bangs on the window and says 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!' His arch enemy! And I think if we choose to accept that that's ultimately Capra's challenge to us, is love your enemies, you will be richer, and the community will be richer if you can find a way to do that.\"",
      "It's a picture-perfect Hollywood ending that endures as a message to our better angels, even if reality doesn't always go that way.",
      "\"It depends if you believe,\" said the angel-winged fan of the film. \"We all have a calling.\"",
      "Anwei Law said, \"There's this need for people to come together. And there's this need for people to care about each other and help each other. And this movie prompts that in people because that's within them.\"",
      "\"It's a spotlight on what we could be, on what we can be?\" I said.",
      "\"Exactly. And we all really want to be.\"",
      "\"And want to be. Not necessarily what we are.\"",
      "\"What we are? Yep, yep,\" said Law.",
      "I'll settle for that!",

      "Comedian and actor Albert Brooks said he's still in shock over the death of one of his oldest and best friends, Rob Reiner.",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News in the special \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" that aired Sunday. Brooks and Reiner met at Beverly Hills High School in a drama class 60 years ago.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found fatally stabbed in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14, authorities said. Their son, Nick, has been charged with first-degree murder in their deaths.",
      "Brooks said there are still moments he forgets his friend is gone.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Brooks said he agreed to sit down with CBS News for the special because he loves to talk about his rare friendship with Reiner and his wife.",
      "\"The fact that I'm here makes my heart break ... that we have to do this because of the reason. But by the same token, I love talking about them, because it's genuine and it's rare. And so, I just wish there was no reason to do this,\" he said.",
      "Brooks and Reiner returned to their high school, reminiscing about their time together while surveying the school's Wall of Fame, during an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in December 2023.",
      "\"This is the first time both of us have been back since we graduated,\" said Reiner. Brooks joked: \"Over a certain age, it's against the law. Well, life works best when you remember.\"",
      "As they pointed out a bench they used to sit on, Reiner joked, \"It brings back no memories,\" as Brooks agreed, \"Nothing. Nothing.\"",
      "Reiner directed the HBO documentary, \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" released in 2023. Before that, the pair was only in one movie together, \"The Muse\" in 1999. \"He hired me. He was nice enough to hire me,\" Reiner said. \"I was,\" Brooks replied.",

    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

      "Bates rose to prominence with her breakout Oscar-winning role in Reiner's adaptation of Stephen King's \"Misery\" in 1990.

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:06:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 19:48:03 -0500",
    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of the weight-loss drug Wegovy.",
    "story": [
      "Regulators at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday gave the green light to a pill version of the blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy, the first daily oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The FDA's approval handed drugmaker Novo Nordisk an edge over rival Eli Lilly in the race to market an obesity pill. Lilly's oral drug, orforglipron, is still under review.",
      "Both pills are GLP-1 drugs that work like widely used injectables to mimic a natural hormone that controls appetite and feelings of fullness.",
      "In recent years, Novo Nordisk's injectable Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound have revolutionized obesity treatment globally and in the U.S., where 100 million people have the chronic disease.",
      "The Wegovy pills are expected to be available within weeks, company officials said. Availability of oral pills to treat obesity could expand the booming market for obesity treatments by broadening access and reducing costs, experts said.",
      "\"I do think that having an oral option would be really helpful, one for improving access, but also as another tool that we can offer patients,\" Dr. Reshmi Srinath, director of the Mount Sinai Weight and Metabolism Management Program in New York, told CBS News.",
      "About 1 in 8 Americans have used injectable GLP-1 drugs, according to a survey from KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. But many more have trouble affording the costly shots.",
      "\"There's an entire demographic that can benefit from the pills,\" said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert. \"For me, it's not just about who gets it across the finish line first. It's about having these options available to patients.\"",
      "The Novo Nordisk obesity pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide. That's the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic and in Rybelsus, a lower-dose pill approved to treat diabetes in 2019.",
      "How much weight did people lose?",
      "In a clinical trial, participants who took oral Wegovy lost 13.6% of their total body weight on average over about 15 months, compared with a 2.2% loss if they took a placebo, or dummy pill. That's nearly the same as injectable Wegovy, with an average weight loss of about 15%.",
      "Chris Mertens, 35, a pediatric lung doctor in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, joined the Novo Nordisk trial in 2022 and lost about 40 pounds using the Wegovy pill.",
      "\"It was a great option, especially when I know I had tried to do things [in] what people may term 'the right way,' with diet and exercise alone,\" Mertens told CBS News.",
      "The daily medication worked to decrease his appetite and invasive thoughts of food, he said. \"If there were days where I missed a meal, I almost didn't realize it.\"",
      "Before he lost weight, Mertens said, \"I was also seeing effects with things like my blood pressure, with one of my doctors telling me I might need to start medicine for my blood pressure because it was getting high enough, as well as cholesterol being elevated.\"",
      "Participants in the\u00a0clinical trial who took the highest dose of Lilly's orforglipron lost 11.2% of their total body weight on average over nearly 17 months, compared with a 2.1% loss in those who took a placebo.",
      "Both pills resulted in less weight loss than the average achieved with Lilly's Zepbound, or tirzepatide, which targets two gut hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, and led to a 21% average weight loss.",
      "All the GLP-1 drugs, oral or injectable, have similar side effects, including nausea and diarrhea.",
      "Both daily pills promise convenience, but the Wegovy pill must be taken with a sip of water in the morning on an empty stomach, with a 30-minute break before eating or drinking.",
      "That's because Novo Nordisk had to design the pill in a way that prevented the drug from being broken down in the stomach before it could be absorbed by the bloodstream. The drugmaker added an ingredient that protects the medication for about 30 minutes in the gut and makes it easier to take effect.",
      "By contrast, Lilly's orforglipron has no dosing restrictions. That drug is being considered under the FDA's new priority voucher program aimed at cutting drug approval times. A decision is expected by spring.",
      "How much will the Wegovy pills cost?",
      "Producing pills is generally cheaper than making drugs delivered via injections, so the cost for the new oral medications could be lower. The Trump administration earlier this year said officials had worked with drugmakers to negotiate lower prices for the GLP-1 drugs, which can cost upwards of $1,000 a month.",
      "The company said the starting dose would be available for $149 per month from some providers. Additional information on cost will be available in January.",
      "It's not clear whether daily pills or weekly injections will be preferred by patients. Although some patients dislike needles, others don't seem to mind the weekly injections, obesity experts said. Mertens turned to injectable Zepbound when he regained weight after the end of the Wegovy pill clinical trial.",
      "He said he liked the discipline of the daily pill.",
      "\"It was a little bit of an intentional routine and a reminder of today I'm taking this so that I know my choices are going to be affected for the day,\" he said.Dr. Angela Fitch, an obesity expert and chief medical officer of knownwell, a health care company, said whatever the format, the biggest benefit will be in making weight-loss medications more widely accessible and affordable.",
      "\"It's all about the price,\" she said. \"Just give me a drug at $100 a month that is relatively effective.\"",

    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",

    "summary": "Job listings for store Santas have plunged in recent years as more families shop online and retailers look to contain costs, a new analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "As if donning an itchy red suit and entertaining kids all day weren't a tough enough gig, the nation's professional Santa Clauses face another cheer-sapping challenge this holiday season: getting a job.",
      "Job listings for store Santas are down 35% this year, compared with 2024, according to Revelio Labs. Indeed, the number of postings at malls, stores and other outlets has fallen sharply since 2022, the workforce research firm found.",
      "The reasons: Employers are cutting budgets, more malls are closing their doors, and many parents these days choose to avoid the crowds \u2014 and the experience of plopping an unsuspecting toddler on a store Santa's lap \u2014 in favor of online shopping.",
      "The drop in Santa job postings comes amid generally soft holiday-season hiring this year as retailers look to contain costs. The nation's unemployment rate surged to 4.6% in November, the highest in more than four years.",
      "The news isn't all bad for Santa wannabes. Although fewer places are hiring, pay is improving \u2014 the median hourly wage for Santa jobs is now $25, up from $21.89 in 2022, Revelio found.",
      "Then again, employers want only the most qualified candidates. Roughly 70% of listings for store Santas this year require a real beard, according to the firm, up from only 14% three years ago.",
      "\"Economists call this a composition effect: The average salary is changing, not because the actual pay is rising, but because of who's left in the hiring pool,\" Revelio said. \"As employers require real beards for most positions, they're hiring only from the higher-paid tier. Average wages climb, but it's not a story of rising pay. It's a shrinking labor market dressed up as good news.\"",

    "story": [
      "Instacart said Monday that it would halt the use of an AI-powered tool that allowed retailers to charge customers different prices for identical items on the grocery delivery platform.",
      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",
      "The announcement comes after a recent investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a nonprofit advocacy group, found evidence that retailers such as Albertsons, Costco, Kroger, Safeway and Sprouts Farmers Market were testing the AI pricing system.",
      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",
      "Reuters reported\u00a0on Dec. 17 that the Federal Trade Commission was probing Instacart over its AI pricing tests. The FTC declined to comment on the report, but said in a statement that it was \"disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Instacart shelving its AI pricing technology.",

    "story": [
      "American consumers in December remained downbeat about the state of the economy, a new survey shows.",
      "The Conference Board, a nonprofit group representing businesses, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1 in December, from November's upwardly revised reading of 92.9. The latest figures are close to the group's reading in April, when President Trump announced tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year's January peak. Four of five components of the overall index fell, while one was at a level signaling notable weakness,\" Dana Peterson, chief Economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "A measure of Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market remained stable at 70.7, but still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. It was the 11th consecutive month that reading has come in under 80.",
      "Consumers' assessments of their current economic situation tumbled 9.5 points to 116.8. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers' biggest concern, along with tariffs.",
      "Perceptions of the job market also declined this month. The conference board's survey reported that 26.7% of consumers said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 28.2% in November. Also, 20.8% of consumers said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up from 20.1% last month.",
      "\"Consumers' write-in responses on factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade and politics,\" Peterson said. \"However, December saw increases in mentions of immigration, war and topics related to personal finances \u2014 including interest rates, taxes and income, banks, and insurance.",
      "Americans remain generally sour about the economy, with most grading the nation's economic performance this year as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse, according to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll.",
      "\"Consumer confidence continued to tumble at the end of the year, as higher prices, a weaker labor market and the waning impact of the government shutdown weighed on household perceptions of the economy,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at investment adviser Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Consumers' perceptions of the current state of the economy are at their lowest point in five years,\" he added.",
      "Consumers still spending",
      "Consumer sentiment continued to ebb last month even as the economy accelerated. Federal data released on Tuesday showed the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a blistering 4.3% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter and the strongest rate of growth in two years.",
      "\"The latest GDP data confirm that even though consumer confidence is slipping, consumers are still spending,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a report. \"The disconnect must mean that incomes are rising briskly. \u00a0But the payroll report says incomes are slowing. So the data are not sending a clear message right now.\"",
      "Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity.",
      "Last week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy gained a healthy 64,000 jobs in November but lost 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% last month, the highest since 2021. Since March, job creation has fallen to an average 35,000 a month, compared to 71,000 in the year ended in March.",

      "Inflation ticks higher",
      "Although GDP growth was surprisingly strong, inflation ticked higher from the previous quarter. Tuesday's data shows that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key barometer of inflation and consumer spending, rose at a 2.8% annual pace in the third quarter, compared with 2.1% between April and June.",
      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year. While inflation remains higher than the Fed would like, consumer prices have not risen as much as many economists initially feared after President Trump unveiled tariffs earlier this year. Some retailers have cushioned the blow for shoppers by absorbing the added costs, while others have passed them on through higher prices.",
      "The labor market remains a weak spot, with employment numbers showing a slowdown in hiring during the second half of 2025. In November, the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest since 2021.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:51:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Analysts point to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as driving the year-end surge.",
    "story": [
      "Gold prices soared above $4,400 on Monday to reach a new all-time high, as analysts pointed to rising geopolitical tensions and softer monetary policy as key drivers of the surge.",
      "The price of the precious metal traded at\u00a0 $4,475 per ounce at 4 p.m. EDT after hitting a high of $4,477 per ounce earlier in the day. The asset has risen more than 70% since the start of this year. Gold is viewed as a safe-haven investment and typically acts as a hedge against inflation.",
      "\"The metals trade has been strong all year, and particularly for gold,\" Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, told CBS News. \"As its fundamentals remain intact, gold digested its recent rally to all-time highs quite well.\"",
      "Silver prices were also rallying on Monday, reaching $69 by 4 p.m. EDT. The metal is up 130% since the start of the year.",
      "Both gold and silver are on pace to reach all-time closing highs today, according to analysts. The rally comes amid expectations for a strong finish in the\u00a0stock market, where tech gains have helped boost performance.",
      "What's driving the surge in gold prices?",
      "Investors are moving money into gold due to a swirl of geopolitical factors, analysts note.",
      "Bond yields around the world floated higher at the same time major global currencies like the yen weakened, Alex Kuptsikevich, the chief market analyst at online brokerage platform FxPro, said in a statement. The combination is reviving interest in the so-called \"debasement trade\" \u2014 a strategy of moving money out of fiat currencies in favor of hard assets like gold, he noted.",
      "Other geopolitical risks, including the U.S. blockade of oil supplies from Venezuela and Ukraine's attack on a Russian shadow fleet tanker in the Mediterranean, were also pushing investors toward gold on Monday, Kuptsikevich added.",
      "Softer monetary policy may also be driving the upswing in gold prices this year, with investors more bullish after three consecutive rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Many on Wall Street expect the central bank to continue to ease monetary policy in 2026, while President Trump is set to nominate a new central bank chief before Fed chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"The latest leg of the rally has been driven by the market pricing in an increasingly gold-friendly 2026 outlook, with lower rates and a potentially softer dollar acting as tailwinds for the bullion,\" said Trevor Yates, senior investment analyst at Global X ETFs, a New York-based investment company.",
      "Central banks in multiple countries are also buying more gold, Yates added, helping drive up the asset's price.",
      "Demand for the precious metal from monetary authorities like the National Bank of Poland has risen in recent months, according to the World Gold Council, a trade association for the gold industry. Central bank gold purchases through October totaled 254 tonnes, a slower pace than the previous three years, the World Gold Council said earlier this month.",
      "Yates said central bank holdings are still far below their historical levels.",
      "What's the forecast for gold in 2026?",
      "Despite investor exuberance this year, the gold rally may not continue its run in 2026, according to Capital Economics. The investment advisory firm predicted in a Monday research note that the price of the precious metal could fall to $3,500 by the end of next year \u2014 and that the drop will act as a drag on silver prices.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-ban-new-foreign-made-drones-china-balks/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Communications Commission says it's banning new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones out of the U.S. market.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mercedes-Benz USA and parent company Daimer AG have agreed to pay $149.6 million to settle allegations that the automaker secretly installed devices in hundreds of thousands of vehicles to pass emission tests, a coalition of attorneys general announced Monday.",
      "According to the coalition, between 2008 and 2016 the German automaker equipped more than 211,000 diesel passenger cars and vans with software devices that optimized emission controls during tests but reduced the controls during normal operations. The devices enabled vehicles to far exceed legal limits for nitrogen oxides, a pollutant that can cause respiratory illnesses and contributes to smog.",
      "The states alleged that Mercedes installed the devices because it couldn't reach design and performance goals such as fuel efficiency while complying with emissions standards. The automaker allegedly concealed the devices from state and federal regulators and the public while marketing the vehicles as \"environmentally friendly\" and compliant with emissions standards.",
      "The agreement is still subject to court approval.",
      "Daimler AG and Mercedes-Benz USA already agreed in 2020 to pay $1.5 billion to the U.S. government and California state regulators to resolve the emissions cheating allegations.",
      "Mercedes-Benz issued a statement saying the deal announced Monday will resolve all remaining legal proceedings tied to diesel emissions in the United States, but the company still considers the accusations unfounded and denies any liability. The automaker has made \"sufficient provisions\" for the cost of the settlement, the statement said.",
      "Fifty attorneys general, including the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, made up the coalition announced Monday. California was not part of the group.",
      "The settlement calls for the automaker to pay the attorneys general $120 million with another $29 million payment suspended and potentially waived pending completion of a consumer relief program.",
      "That effort will extend to the roughly 40,000 vehicles with the devices that hadn't been repaired or permanently removed from the road by Aug. 1, 2023. The owners of those vehicles would get $2,000 per vehicle if they install approved emissions modification software and an extended warranty.",
      "The settlement also calls for Mercedes to comply with reporting requirements and refrain from any further unfair or deceptive marketing or sale of diesel vehicles.",
      "Volkswagen also ended up paying $2.8 billion to settle a criminal case due to emissions cheating.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:21:16 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has approved a preliminary agreement for a class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples as they do with heterosexual couples.",
    "story": [
      "Like many young girls, Mara Berton and June Higginbotham both knew from an early age they wanted families and to become mothers. But as lesbians, they were excluded from accessing the same fertility treatment insurance benefits offered to heterosexual peers.",
      "Instead, like many other same-sex couples, Berton and Higginbotham, who live in California, had to pay $45,000 out of pocket to conceive while heterosexual colleagues with the same insurance plan had many of those costs covered.",
      "\"We knew it wasn't right,\" Berton said in an exclusive interview with CalMatters. She joined a class action lawsuit challenging the policy. \"What we're fighting for is about family building and having kids ... It was really important to both of us, I think, that other couples not have to do this.\"",
      "Last week, in a landmark settlement, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California Haywood Gilliam Jr. approved a preliminary agreement for the class action lawsuit requiring Aetna to cover fertility treatments for same-sex couples \u2014 like artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization \u2014 as they do with heterosexual couples. It is the first case requiring a health insurer to apply this policy nationally across all of its enrollees. An estimated 2.8 million LGBTQ members will benefit, including 91,000 Californians.",
      "Under the settlement, Aetna will also pay at least $2 million in damages to California-based members who qualify. Those who may be eligible must submit a claim by June 29, 2026.",
      "\"I truly hope that this is the first of many insurers to change their policy,\" said Alison Tanner, senior litigation counsel for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center. \"We were looking at that as an issue of inequality \u2014 that folks who were in same-sex relationships were being treated differently.\"",
      "Roughly 9 million additional Californians will soon have access to mandated fertility benefits under a new law taking effect in January. The law applies to state-regulated plans \u2014 which Aetna is not in this case \u2014 and amends the definition of infertility to include same-sex couples and single people.",
      "Previously, Aetna's policy required enrollees to engage in six to 12 months of \"unprotected heterosexual sexual intercourse\" without conceiving before qualifying for fertility benefits, according to the class action complaint. The policy allowed for women \"without a male partner\" to access benefits only after undergoing six to 12 cycles of artificial insemination unsuccessfully depending on age.",
      "Lawyers argued that the policy fundamentally treated LGBTQ members differently and effectively denied them access to the benefit, which can be prohibitively expensive for many people.",
      "In an email, Aetna spokesperson Phillip Blando said the plan provides infertility benefits in accordance with each member's plan, coverage rules and applicable law.",
      "\"Aetna is committed to equal access to infertility coverage and reproductive health coverage for all its members, and we will continue to strive toward improving access to services for our entire membership,\" Blando said.",
      "Berton, who was the lead plaintiff in the case, said she was blindsided by the policy. She had consulted with a fertility clinic and decided to move forward with donor sperm and artificial insemination, when a representative from Aetna called and said she did not meet the definition of infertility.",
      "She appealed the decision multiple times; she was rejected. The experience felt \"dehumanizing,\" her wife Higginbotham said.",
      "Insurance had dictated Berton attempt 12 rounds of artificial insemination before she would be eligible for benefits. Her doctors recommended no more than four rounds.",
      "Sean Tipton, chief advocacy and policy director for the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, said a policy like that could only be designed to dissuade people from accessing their health benefits. Doctors typically recommend three to four cycles of artificial insemination before IVF, but Tipton said there have also been studies showing it is more efficient and cost effective to go straight to IVF.",
      "In 2023, the society updated its medical definition of infertility to include LGBTQ folks and individuals who don't have partners. They did so in part to stop insurers from denying claims like Berton and Higginbotham's.",
      "\"The driving force was a realization that it takes two kinds of gametes to have kids,\" Tipton said. \"Regardless of the cause of that absence, you have to have access in order to be treated for a fertility issue.\"",
      "Since the definition changed, Tipton said more employers and insurers are covering benefits for LGBTQ folks or single people. They have also leveraged the definition to enact statewide benefits expansions, including California's upcoming fertility benefits mandate.",
      "Berton and Higginbotham said they also worried about running out of donor sperm that matched Higginbotham's Jewish and Native American heritage \u2014 and was limited in supply.",
      "\"I don't feel like your insurance should be involved in those types of decisions and kind of determine your journey,\" Berton said.",
      "The couple pulled together money from family members and decided to proceed even without coverage. After four unsuccessful rounds of intrauterine insemination, they moved on to IVF, partially to give themselves the best chance of conceiving with the donor they chose.",
      "The experience was \"all consuming\" and emotionally difficult as Berton endured hormone injections, egg retrievals and a miscarriage. But today, she and Higginbotham have two healthy twin girls whose favorite thing is to play on the swings and \"take every book off of their shelf\" for their mothers to read.",
      "The couple achieved their family dreams before the lawsuit concluded. Even so, Higginbotham said she hopes the settlement will help other LGBTQ couples across the country.",
      "\"I know people that don't have children, that wanted children, because the stuff isn't covered. I know people that their timeline was delayed and maybe they have fewer kids than they wanted,\" Higginbotham said. \"The settlement is such a huge step forward that is really righting a huge wrong.\"",

      "Jim Beam, which is owned by a U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Suntory Holdings, said in an email to CBS News that its distillery in Clermont, Kentucky, will temporarily halt production \"while we take the opportunity to invest in site enhancements.\" The company plans to keep its James B. Beam campus open for visitors during that time, the company added.",
      "Jim Beam will continue to distill at its Fred B. Noe craft distillery in Clermont and Booker Noe distillery in Boston, Kentucky.",
      "The pause comes amid several challenges in the wine and spirits industry. Americans overall are drinking less, with Gallup finding that the share of U.S. adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, near a 90-year low.",
      "Exports of U.S.-produced spirits fell 9% in the second quarter, partly due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, according to an October report from the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group. Exports to Canada were particularly hard hit, declining by 85% during the period, after Canadian retailers pulled U.S. spirits from shelves in retaliation for President Trump's tariffs, the group noted.",
      "Through August, whiskey distillers had produced 55 million fewer proof gallons this year than a year ago, a decline of 28%, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. A proof gallon is one U.S. gallon of liquid that is 50% proof alcohol.",
      "Whiskey connoisseurs may not have to worry about supplies running low. Kentucky warehouses now hold a record 16.1 million barrels of aging bourbon, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association. The total \u2014 reported in October \u2014 marks the highest level since the repeal of Prohibition and reflects a 27% increase from 2024, the group said.",
      "The surge in bourbon supplies is partly due to an increase in the number of distillers located in Kentucky, the group said. But the industry is also witnessing a dip in demand due to uncertainty over tariffs, declining exports and shifts in drinking habits, it added.",
      "Bourbon, a type of whiskey, must adhere to U.S. distilling laws to be labeled as such. For instance, the liquor must be aged in new, charred oak containers and the grain recipe must be at least 51% corn, according to whiskey tourism site Bourbon Country.",

    "story": [
      "In a TikTok video, then-17-year-old actor Symonne Harrison unveils a bathroom counter full of products from the skincare brand Drunk Elephant that would retail for at least $700 total.",
      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "ALSO READ:\u00a0California bill targeting anti-aging skincare sales to minors dies without vote | \"Sephora kids\" investigation",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",

      "Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world's most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro, or $2.35, fee for tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City's efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome's cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city $7.6 million extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome's Pantheon monument.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro or nearly $6 tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\"We believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\" Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \"We think it's correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",
      "So far this year, around 9 million people have waited in line to get that close-up visit, with some days as many as 70,000 passing through, Gualtieri said. That system now becomes permanent from 9 a.m.-9 p.m., with the fee to be paid by nonresidents. Visitors can either pay in advance online, while waiting in line or by buying tickets at tourist locations around town.",
      "After nightfall, access is open and free.",
      "Pope Urban VIII initially commissioned the fountain in 1640. In 1730, Pope Clement XII revived the project and the current fountain corresponds to the original designs of Roman architect Nicola Salvi.",

      "European officials have sought to curb overtourism amid protests from residents who say large amounts of visitors are making cities difficult to live in. Last year, Venice became the first city to\u00a0impose a tax for day-tripping tourists. A spate of viral incidents, including a woman who scaled the Trevi Fountain to\u00a0fill up her water bottle\u00a0and a British man who\u00a0carved his and his girlfriends' initials\u00a0into the Colosseum, also drew attention to the issue.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:18:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:13:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists had expected CPI to rise at an annual rate of 3% last month.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told\u00a0CNBC on Friday that data distortions likely pushed the CPI reading down by \"probably a tenth or so.\"",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:06:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "summary": "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits over allegations of poor care.",
    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

Basic Economy customers will continue to receive one free personal item and one free carry-on bag, free snacks, soft drinks and in-flight entertainment.\"",
      "Over the past decade, major airlines introduced bare-bones tickets with few perks to better compete with budget carriers. For example, purchasers of a basic economy ticket generally cannot reserve seats without charge, can't change their itineraries without paying a fee and are last to board flights.",
      "In its most recent quarter, American Airlines lost $114 million on revenue of $13.7 billion, according to a regulatory\u00a0filing.",
      "\"American has been trying to find this sweet spot with basic economy fares where it wants them to be available, but doesn't want people who might otherwise book more expensive fares to be booking them,\" Scott Keyes, founder of travel deals website Going.com, told CBS News. \"So they are rolling back some perks and benefits associated with them to make them less appealing to people who could decide, 'I'll pay an extra $40 to be in main economy rather than basic.'\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",

This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Dec 2025 00:04:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The declaration issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited. After taking office in January, President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to cut federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",
      "Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.",
      "The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers \u2014 and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",
      "Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Mr. Trump returned to office \u2014 even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first time the Supreme Court had waded into the issue of health care for transgender youth.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18.",
      "The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.",
      "Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia. Pennsylvania's Democratic governor also joined.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-borrowers-default-wages-garnished-2026/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",
      "The Associated  Press, \n                                                  \n                                  Aimee  Picchi and \n                                                  \n                                  Caitlin  Yilek\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-supreme-court-national-guard-chicago/",
    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump invoked a law called Title 10 to bring members of the Illinois National Guard under federal service over the objections of state and local leaders.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by the Trump administration to deploy National Guard members to the Chicago area while a legal challenge moves forward, delivering a setback to President Trump in his effort to use federalized troops in Illinois to ensure enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "The high court left untouched a judge's decision blocking the government from putting National Guard members on the streets of Chicago and surrounding areas. The Trump administration had urged the Supreme Court to allow the extraordinary move to deploy the troops over the objection of Illinois' Democratic governor, arguing that federal courts cannot second-guess the president's decision to call the National Guard into federal service.",
      "But the Supreme Court declined the administration's request to freeze that order in a decision that appears to be 6-3. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.",
      "In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court found that \"at least in this posture\" the Trump administration has not met its burden to show that Title 10, the law Mr. Trump invoked, permits him to federalize the National Guard \"in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement calling the ruling \"a big win for Illinois and American democracy.\"\u00a0Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the Supreme Court for \"rebuking President Trump's attempts to militarize and demonize our city.\"",
      "The White House said nothing in the high court's ruling detracts from the president's agenda.",
      "\"The president promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property. Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has brought state-run National Guards under federal control in several U.S. cities as his administration has ramped up immigration enforcement operations. Mr. Trump has so far moved to deploy National Guard units in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago to protect federal property and personnel, and he has threatened to send troops to other major cities, including Baltimore and San Francisco.",
      "Two West Virginia National Guard members who were sent to Washington, D.C., were shot in an ambush-style attack near the White House last month. One of the victims died and the other was severely wounded.",
      "As for Illinois, the president issued a memo in early October claiming that federal facilities in the state \"have come under coordinated assault by violent groups intent on obstructing federal law enforcement activities,\" which he said hindered the execution of U.S. immigration laws.",
      "The directive came after the processing center for immigrant detainees in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, saw a rise in protests following the launch of an immigration enforcement campaign called Operation Midway Blitz in early September.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump authorized the federalization of the Illinois National Guard under\u00a0Title 10. The law allows the president to call into federal service members of a state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the \"regular forces\" or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "Roughly 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard prepared to mobilize. Federalized members of the Texas and California National Guards also arrived in Illinois in early October but have since left the state.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker objected to the president's move, arguing that there was no public safety need that required the deployment of National Guard troops. The state of Illinois and city of Chicago then sued the Trump administration, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization of the National Guard is illegal. They sought a temporary order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area.",
      "U.S. District Judge April Perry sided with Illinois officials and issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from ordering the federalization and deployment of the National Guard within Illinois. In her October decision, she called information from Department of Homeland Security officials about events in Illinois \"unreliable.\"",
      "\"There has been no showing that the civil power has failed,\" Perry wrote. \"The agitators who have violated the law by attacking federal authorities have been arrested. The courts are open, and the marshals are ready to see that any sentences of imprisonment are carried out. Resort to the military to execute the laws is not called for.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit then allowed the Guard members to remain under federal service, but upheld the portion of Perry's order forbidding them from being sent out to the Chicago area.",
      "In their decision, the 7th Circuit judges found that the Trump administration failed to satisfy the conditions for invoking Title 10 to call the National Guard into federal service in Illinois.",
      "\"Political opposition is not rebellion,\" the 7th Circuit judges wrote. \"A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protestors advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows.\"",
      "The 7th Circuit also found there is \"insufficient evidence\" that the demonstrations in Illinois have hampered the ability of federal officers to enforce immigration laws.",
      "\"Federal facilities, including the processing facility in Broadview, have remained open despite regular demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies,\" the judges said. \"And though federal officers have encountered sporadic disruptions, they have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration argued that courts cannot review the president's decision to call up the National Guard.",
      "\"A federal district court lacks not only the authority but also the competence to wrest control of the military chain of command from the Commander in Chief and to adjudicate whether the Governor of Illinois, rather than the President, should be in ultimate command of particular Guardsmen after the President has called them into federal service,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Sauer also argued violence and threats of violence have impeded immigration enforcement operations and forced the Department of Homeland Security to divert resources away from law enforcement activities to protect federal buildings and officers.",
      "\"The National Guard's deployment would protect lives and federal property, deter acts of violence, free up resources for actual law enforcement, and assist federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties effectively,\" he said.",
      "Illinois officials, meanwhile, argued that state and local law enforcement have effectively handled the protests outside the Broadview facility. They warned that allowing National Guard troops onto the streets in the Chicago area could spark confrontations.",
      "\"[T]he unnecessary deployment of military troops, untrained for local policing, will escalate tensions and undermine the ordinary law enforcement activities of state and local entities, which would need to divert resources to maintain safety and order,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in mid-October, but the high court sought additional information from government lawyers and Illinois officials about whether the term \"regular forces\" refers to the U.S. military.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority concluded that the phrase \"regular forces\" likely means the military, so Title 10 likely applies only where the military can legally execute the laws. Those circumstances are \"exceptional,\" the high court said in its order, since the military is forbidden under a law called the Posse Comitatus Act from engaging in domestic law enforcement, except when authorized by Congress or the Constitution.",
      "\"So before the President can federalize the Guard under [Title 10], he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be 'unable' with those forces to perform that function,\" the court said. \"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois.\"",
      "Beyond Illinois, Mr. Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland has set off legal challenges brought by officials in those states. Two trial court judges in California and Oregon initially blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard units to areas of those states. But separate three-judge panels on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued decisions allowing the Trump administration to deploy members of the California National Guard within Los Angeles and the Oregon National Guard in Portland while the legal proceedings continued.",
      "The full 9th Circuit declined to reconsider the panel's decision as to the California National Guard. A district judge in December then again blocked the Trump administration's deployment, and that order has been appealed.",
      "But as to Oregon, a federal judge held a three-day trial and issued a ruling last month finding that the president did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard. She permanently blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland. The Justice Department appealed the decision to the 9th Circuit, and the chief judge for the appeals court allowed the Oregon Guard troops to remain under federal control while proceedings move forward.",
      "While the 9th and 7th Circuits have split on whether Mr. Trump can send National Guard troops into cities, they agree that courts can review the president's use of Title 10 to call the units into federal service.",
      "In Washington, D.C., a federal judge ruled last month that his National Guard deployment there violates federal law. The judge paused her decision for 21 days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday gave the Trump administration two weeks to submit a plan to either return a group of Venezuelan men previously held at a notorious Salvadoran prison to the U.S., or give them a hearing to contest allegations of gang membership.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg issued the order after finding that 137 Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and held at the infamous CECOT megaprison had been denied their due process rights. Boasberg determined that the men were in the legal custody of the U.S. during the months they spent detained at CECOT, and that they should've been given a chance to challenge the Trump administration's allegations that they were gang members.",
      "\"On the merits, the Court concludes that this class was denied their due-process rights and will thus require the Government to facilitate their ability to obtain such hearing. Our law requires no less,\" Boasberg wrote in his opinion Monday.",
      "The group of 137 men who could benefit from the ruling is a subset of more than 200 Venezuelan deportees sent to CECOT in March, some of whom were deported to El Salvador under traditional immigration procedures. All of the Venezuelan men held at CECOT were released this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap.",
      "Boasberg said the U.S. government could comply with his order by allowing the men to return to the U.S. or otherwise offering them a hearing. The administration, he wrote, could \"theoretically offer Plaintiffs a hearing without returning them to the United States so long as such hearing satisfied the requirements of due process.\"",
      "Boasberg gave the government until Jan. 5 to file a plan to comply with his order.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said \"Judge Boasberg is way over his skis.\"",
      "\"He has been shut down by appellate courts again and again on this case,\" she added. \"We look forward to continuing to defend our actions in court.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the men ceased to be in U.S. custody after they were sent to El Salvador, so U.S. courts do not have jurisdiction to hear legal claims challenging their detention. But Boasberg wrote that the U.S. effectively maintained control over the men because El Salvador held them in prison at the U.S.'s behest, and the administration paid for them to be detained at CECOT.",
      "The first group of Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were deported on March 15, soon after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act and declared alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang enemies of the state who could be detained and deported with little to no due process.",
      "At the time, Trump administration officials called the deportees dangerous criminals, terrorists and gangsters.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT on March 15. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "A report released last month by human rights groups determined that the treatment of the Venezuelan deportees imprisoned at CECOT amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse.",
      "Lee Gelernt, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing the former CECOT prisoners in court, lauded Monday's order.",
      "\"After enduring months of torture, these men will finally get the due process they deserve, notwithstanding the Trump administration's underhanded attempts to deny them any opportunity to content the accusations that they are gang members,\" he said.",

      "The effort appears to have intensified in recent weeks, targeting asylum-seekers with pending cases in immigration courts in Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and elsewhere across the U.S., multiple immigration lawyers and certified legal representatives told CBS News.",
      "Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch. Instead, they are administrative entities run by the Justice Department, which employs and oversees the judges that adjudicate the cases of people facing deportation. Lawyers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement represent the government in the proceedings.",
      "The administration's new tactic involves ICE attorneys asking the immigration judges to toss out asylum claims without hearing them on the merits. In these requests, known as \"pretermit\" motions, ICE argues that asylum-seekers fearing persecution in their home countries can instead be deported to one of several nations the Trump administration has persuaded to accept deportees who are not their citizens.",
      "As part of the effort, ICE attorneys have asked immigration judges to order asylum-seekers deported to third countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News and interviews with immigration lawyers. If granted, those petitions nullify asylum-seekers' claims and clear the way for them to be deported to third countries, absent any appeals.",
      "Previously undisclosed internal government data obtained by CBS News indicates that, as of early December, ICE attorneys had filed more than 8,000 motions in immigration court to toss out asylum claims by citing deportation agreements with third countries.",
      "The campaign is the latest move by President Trump to sharply curtail access to the American asylum system, which his administration has argued is being systematically abused by migrants who came to the U.S. for economic reasons, especially those who entered illegally along the southern border under the Biden administration.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration is \"working to get illegal aliens out of our country as quickly as possible while ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,\" the department added, citing \"lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strategy rests on a section of immigration law that disqualifies migrants from asylum if the applicant is eligible to request legal protection in another nation that has agreed to a \"safe third country\" arrangement with the U.S.",
      "In late October, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions by immigration courts, issued a ruling that lawyers believe will turbocharge efforts by the government to use \"safe third country\" agreements to cancel asylum cases. That order directed immigration judges to decide the motions by ICE to send immigrants to third-party countries before reviewing their asylum applications. It also placed the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they should not be sent to a third country because of fears of being persecuted there.",
      "\"You just have to give up\"",
      "While the Trump administration has argued its latest effort is meant to curb asylum fraud, multiple immigration lawyers told CBS News the campaign has affected clients with strong asylum claims who fled persecution in countries like Iran, Nicaragua and Russia.",
      "The attorneys argued the government's campaign is designed to eliminate the path to asylum in the U.S. Some said it is meant to coerce asylum-seekers into withdrawing their claims, by scaring them with the prospect of being deported to a country that is not their own.",
      "\"They see the asylum system as a whole as a problem, because it impedes them from deporting people in a quick manner,\" said Pa\u00fal Pirela, an immigration lawyer in Houston.",
      "\"If you want to apply for asylum, we're forcing you to apply in a country that you've never been to,\" Pirela continued. \"You just have to give up and go back to your country or go somewhere else,\" he added later.",
      "Pirela said one of his clients, a Nicaraguan asylum-seeker and political dissident, was ordered deported to Honduras after the government filed a pretermit motion in his case. ICE, he added, is also trying to get another client, an asylum applicant from Guatemala, ordered deported to Honduras.",
      "Atlanta immigration attorney Adriana Heffley got notice that DHS had motioned to pretermit her client's case and deport him to Uganda four days before a hearing, she told CBS News. Her client is from Iran, and was apprehended at the border when he entered the U.S. illegally last December, she said. He has been detained ever since.",
      "Heffley and her client had prepared a case arguing that he would face persecution and danger in Iran as someone who had previously been in same-sex relationships. But they had to switch gears and quickly prove he would also suffer in Uganda. The judge agreed and denied the DHS motion to preempt the case.",
      "\"Immigrants who are coming up on a hearing that will determine the course of the rest of their lives and their fate and their safety are being hit with this left-field motion just a day or two before that final hearing,\" Heffley said.",
      "New York immigration attorney David Treyster is not confident his case will see the same outcome. DHS moved to deport his client, a Russian national, and her 4-year-old child, to Uganda, he told CBS News. The judge initially planned to give Treyster 30 minutes to confer with her before hearing opposing arguments and ruling on the motion. After pleading with the judge, Treyster was able to schedule the hearing for Tuesday.",
      "The judge \"seemed to imply that her hands are being tied,\" he said, given the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling that the third-country deportations must be considered first. \"We haven't even had our hearing, [but] the judge kept saying, 'you're going to have to appeal this.'\"",
      "\"The person timely and properly applied for asylum and is in line waiting their turn, doing everything that the administration wants people to do, reporting to their court hearings, filing all their papers on time, and here we are just taking that due process away from them,\" Treyster added.",
      "Some immigration attorneys are challenging the tactic in court, including the 2019 regulation that ICE attorneys have been citing in their motions arguing that asylum-seekers can be deported to third countries.",
      "\"I think that this is in line with this administration's attempt to completely eviscerate the availability of asylum and other forms of protection in this country,\" said Blaine Bookey, legal director for San Francisco's Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the groups litigating the case. \"This is, in their view, an easy way to cut off a case at the knees.\"",

Last week, the White House announced the board had voted to rename the institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.",

      "With hits like \"All My Ex's Live in Texas,\" \"Amarillo by Morning\" and \"Check Yes or No,\" George Strait is known as the King of Country Music.",
      "The multiplatinum artist has won dozens of awards from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association, as well as a Grammy for best country album. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006.",
      "When Strait received a lifetime achievement award from the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 2021, he said his father taught him the ways of the cowboy life and that he's tried to hold on to his Western heritage throughout his career. But he also said he was challenged early on to stay true to himself.",
      "\"When I first signed with MCA Records in 1981, you know, they, all the people, were going, 'Take the hat off,'\" he said, pointing at his trademark 10-gallon cowboy hat with a grin. \"Now, can you imagine if I would have done that?\"",
      "A producer also floated the idea that Strait change his name. \"My dad was so glad I didn't do that,\" Strait said.",
      "Gloria Gaynor, the Queen of Disco",
      "Gloria Gaynor's 1978 hit \"I Will Survive\" has stood the test of time, surviving far longer than disco did and crowning the New Jersey singer as the genre's queen.",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording. When it was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in 2016, the library said \"I Will Survive\" became known as an \"emblem of women's empowerment\" and an anthem in the LGBTQ community.",
      "\"That song taps into the inherent survival instinct and it taps into the tenacity of the human spirit,\" Gaynor told CBS News in 2016.",
      "As she recalled recently, when she recorded the hit, she was paralyzed from the waist down while recovering from a serious spinal injury after a fall onstage.",
      "\"I had been in hospital for over three months, hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I'd survive the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior,\" Gaynor said. \"Yeah, I was living that song, and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one.\"",
      "Legendary rock band Kiss",
      "This year's celebration is a bittersweet moment for the founding members of Kiss. Ace Frehley, the band's original lead guitarist, died in October, just a few weeks after he, Peter Criss, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were named among this year's honorees.",
      "\"The saddest thing of all is that Ace couldn't live long enough to see this amazing thing,\" Simmons told CBS News.",
      "Kiss is known as much for their hits like \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" and \"Detroit Rock City\" as they are for their signature black-and-white face paint. The group rode the glam rock wave to stardom, selling more than 100 million records worldwide and entering the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "Simmons and Stanley's partnership has lasted for decades, overcoming the difficulties of making it in the music business.",
      "\"I don't think it's a coincidence that both of us are Jewish and from immigrants who experienced the Holocaust,\" Stanley told CBS News. \"I think that innately we have inside us compassion for other people but also a sense of survival.\"",

      "Famed composer Andrew Lloyd Webber picked Michael Crawford to play the titular role in the long-running musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\" when it first opened in London in 1986.",
      "\"When he played to me the overture, the hair stood up on the back of my neck,\" Crawford told CBS News. \"I adored playing and creating it, building him.\"",
      "After winning an Olivier Award \u2014 the U.K. equivalent of the Tony Award \u2014 for musical of the year, the show opened on Broadway in New York in 1988, winning seven Tonys, including best actor in a musical for Crawford.",
      "Crawford's career has also included roles in movies and on television, but he considered those to be auditions for his next part. For him, playing the Phantom was a gift.",
      "\"So, you want to do the eight shows a week,\" Crawford said. \"You don't want to miss one.\"",
      "American icon Sylvester Stallone",
      "Sylvester Stallone wants people to understand one thing about his classic movie \"Rocky.\"",
      "\"Even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie,\" Stallone told CBS News. \"It's not. It's a love story. It starts with love.\"",
      "For Stallone, who received Oscar nominations for playing Rocky Balboa and writing the screenplay for what was named 1976's best picture, the film was about the love between Rocky and Talia Shire's Adrian.",
      "\"This movie will rise and fall on love, not fights,\" Stallone said. \"Everyone can sort of go, oh my God, it's the little things in life, it's the love, it's the nurturing \u2014 that's the victory.\"",
      "Stallone calls the movie his biography when at the time he felt like he couldn't win. He went into acting in his 20s after growing up with his father, who Stallone said was emotionally and physically abusive. Movies were a way for Stallone to cope, and he said the mythic heroes he saw on screen changed his life.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to be that guy,'\" Stallone said. \"I don't want to be what's at the house, but I do want to be this noble creature.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Federal Communications Commission on Monday said it would ban new foreign-made drones, a move that will keep new Chinese-made drones such as those from DJI and Autel out of the U.S. market.",
      "The announcement came a year after Congress passed a defense bill that raised national security concerns about Chinese-made drones, which have become a dominant player in the U.S., widely used in farming, mapping, law enforcement and filmmaking.",
      "The bill called for stopping the two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review found they posed a risk to American national security. The deadline for the review was Dec. 23.",
      "The FCC said Monday the review found that all drones and critical components produced in foreign countries, not just by the two Chinese companies, posed \"unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.\" But it said specific drones or components would be exempt if the Pentagon or Department of Homeland Security determined they didn't pose such risks.",
      "The FCC cited upcoming major events, such as the 2026 World Cup, America250 celebrations and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, as reasons to address potential drone threats posed by \"criminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists.\"",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International, said in a statement that the industry group welcomes the decision. He said it's time for the U.S. not only to reduce its dependence on China but build its own drones.",
      "\"Recent history underscores why the United States must increase domestic drone production and secure its supply chains,\" Robbins said, citing Beijing's willingness to restrict critical supplies such as rare earth magnets to serve its strategic interests.",
      "A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, Lin Jian, said Tuesday that Beijing opposed the U.S. setting up \"discriminatory\" lists and urged the Trump administration to \"correct its wrong practices\" and provide a fair environment for Chinese companies, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "DJI said it was disappointed by the FCC decision. \"While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Concerns about DJI's data security have not been grounded in evidence and instead reflect protectionism, contrary to the principles of an open market,\" the company said.",
      "In Texas, Gene Robinson has a fleet of nine DJI drones that he uses for law enforcement training and forensic analyses. He said the new restrictions would hurt him and many others who have come to rely on the Chinese drones because of their versatility, high performance and affordable prices.",
      "But he said he understands the decision and lamented that the U.S. had outsourced the manufacturing to China. \"Now, we are paying the price,\" Robinson said. \"To get back to where we had the independence, there will be some growing pains. We need to suck it up, and let's not have it happen again.\"",
      "Also in Texas, Arthur Erickson, chief executive officer and co-founder of the drone-making company Hylio, said the departure of DJI would provide much-needed room for American companies like his to grow. New investments are pouring in to help him ramp up production of spray drones, which farmers use to fertilize their fields, and it will bring down prices, Erickson said.",
      "But he also called it \"crazy\" and \"unexpected\" that the FCC should expand the scope to all foreign-made drones and drone components. \"The way it's written is a blanket statement,\" Erickson said. \"There's a global allied supply chain. I hope they will clarify that.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department began disclosing\u00a0thousands of files and photos\u00a0related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, Dec. 19, with additional batches released in subsequent days, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing that the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that have been disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into different data sets. Many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",

      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department is facing continued backlash over its partial releases of files related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with lawmakers and survivors denouncing the limited scope of the disclosures.",
      "The Trump administration faced a Dec. 19 deadline to release most of the government's records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law last month. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files will be released on a rolling basis over the coming weeks due to the volume of the materials and the need to shield the personal information of survivors.",
      "A first tranche of records was made public Friday, followed by a second batch Saturday. Many of the documents contained significant redactions, including whole pages of records that were blacked out.",
      "Early Tuesday, the department released tens of thousands of additional documents from the files. It wasn't immediately clear what impact that release would have on the criticism of the earlier releases.",
      "The Justice Department also removed more than a dozen of the earlier files without an initial explanation. The department said on X on Saturday that files would continue to be \"reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the removed files was an image of a group of framed photos, including two that appeared to show Mr. Trump. The department said on Sunday that the file was \"temporarily removed\" out of an abundance of caution after federal prosecutors in New York flagged it \"for potential further action to protect victims.\" The department reposted the photo after it said a review determined that \"there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph.\" Mr. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein.",
      "A group of survivors of abuse by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate who was convicted of sex trafficking, called on Congress to hold hearings and take legal action to demand compliance with the law. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence.",
      "\"It is alarming that the United States Department of Justice, the very agency tasked with upholding the law, has violated the law, both by withholding massive quantities of documents, and by failing to redact survivor identities,\" they said in a statement Monday.",
      "The survivors said the government released \"a fraction of the files,\" and said the material that was disclosed was \"riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution Monday that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes in the new year.",
      "Schumer called the Justice Department's rollout a \"blatant cover-up,\" claiming Attorney General Pam Bondi and Blanche \"are shielding Donald Trump from accountability, and the Senate has a duty to act.\"",
      "\"The law Congress passed is crystal clear: release the Epstein files in full so Americans can see the truth,\" Schumer said in a statement.",
      "Bondi said in a post on X on Sunday\u00a0that the Justice Department \"will bring charges against anyone involved in the trafficking and exploitation of Jeffrey Epstein's victims,\" and urged any survivors with information to come forward.",
      "But in July, the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that a review of the government's files related to Epstein \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Reps. Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna expressed dissatisfaction with the release on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday. Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, authored the Epstein legislation and worked together on the discharge petition to force a vote on the measure.",
      "Massie said he and Khanna are \"talking about and drafting\" a resolution to hold Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress, which he called \"the quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims.\"",
      "Inherent contempt is a rarely used tool that Congress can use to enforce compliance with its directives. A 2017 report from the Congressional Research Service called it a \"long dormant\" power that allows lawmakers \"to detain and imprison a contemnor until the individual complies with congressional demands.\" The report noted that while there \"may be an argument for the imposition of monetary fines\" as an alternative, there's no precedent for Congress imposing a fine for contempt.",
      "Last year, a push by GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida to hold then-Attorney General Merrick Garland in inherent contempt fell short in the House. Though she had initially signaled that she was pursuing a resolution to hold Garland in custody, the final measure would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena.",
      "Khanna said he and Massie are \"building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents.\" To force a vote on the House floor upon the chamber's return next month, the resolution would likely be offered as a privileged motion, which would require leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the attorney general had 30 days from its enactment to make public \"all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" in the Justice Department's possession that related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "The law prohibited the government from withholding, delaying or redacting records \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.\" But it did allow the attorney general to redact certain portions of documents, including personally identifiable information of survivors or depictions of child sexual abuse.",
      "The law also requires the Justice Department to provide written justification for any redactions to Congress.",
      "The president, asked about the Epstein documents at an event at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida Monday, voiced frustration that there is still so much attention focused on them.",
      "\"I believe they gave over 100,000 pages of documents,\" he said. \"And there is tremendous backlash, it's an interesting question, because a lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party. And you ruin a reputation of somebody. So a lot of people are very angry that this continues.\"",
      "Epstein was under investigation in South Florida in the early 2000s, but ultimately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Miami to escape federal charges. He agreed to instead plead guilty to state prostitution charges and serve 18 months in prison.",
      "He was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in New York in 2019 and died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility weeks later.",

      "The military has hit at least 29 alleged drug vessels since early September, killing 105 people. President Trump has argued that boat strikes have been effective at quelling drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, but critics have questioned the president's legal authority to carry out the strikes.",
      "Monday's strike targeted a vessel in international waters that was \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes,\" the U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X. The military said the boat was operated by a designated terrorist organization \u2014 it did not specify the organization, but the Trump administration has categorized several Latin American drug cartels as terror groups.",
      "The military called the target of Monday's operation a \"low-profile vessel.\" Narcotics trafficking groups have\u00a0long been accused of using submarines and semi-submersible \"low-profile\" boats to transport drugs in certain cases.

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday that the release of thousands of photos from the government's files on Jeffrey Epstein risked ensnaring \"highly respected\" people with no connection to the late sex offender's crimes, in the president's first public remarks since the files were released last week.",
      "The congressionally mandated releases brought to light images of former President Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, among others. Epstein was known for cultivating relationships with the rich and powerful, and he socialized with both Clinton and Mr. Trump at various points \u2014 though neither man has been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "Asked Monday what he thought about the emergence of photos of Clinton, Mr. Trump called it \"terrible\" and said he's \"always gotten along\" with the former president \u2014 and argued other people who appear in the photos could be unfairly tarred.",
      "\"I don't like the pictures of Bill Clinton being shown. I don't like the pictures of other people being shown. I think it's a terrible thing,\" the president told reporters. \"I think Bill Clinton's a big boy, he can handle it. But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago ... and they're highly respected bankers and lawyers and others.\"",
      "The president said Epstein was \"all over Palm Beach\" and many people crossed paths with him.",
      "\"A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein, but they're in a picture with him because he was at a party, and you ruin a reputation of somebody,\" Mr. Trump said Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "The Justice Department began releasing records on Epstein on Friday, a deadline set by Congress last month in the bipartisan Epstein Files Transparency Act that was signed by Mr. Trump. The department has said it plans to release more files \"on a rolling basis\" over the next few weeks, despite the law's Dec. 19 deadline, citing the need to redact victims' names and other information from documents.",
      "The files include decades' worth of material from the federal government's investigations into Epstein and his convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in 2019, but died by suicide in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial. Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted of trafficking. Epstein was also investigated by federal prosecutors in the 2000s, but in a controversial move, he avoided federal charges in exchange for a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in Florida.",
      "Mr. Trump encouraged GOP members to vote for the law after deriding Republicans who pushed for more information on the government's Epstein investigations, calling Democrats' fixation on the issue a \"hoax\" and arguing Democrats were using it as a distraction.",

      "\"I hate to see photos come out of [Clinton], but this is what the Democrats, mostly Democrats, and a couple of bad Republicans are asking for,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to the four House Republicans who joined with Democrats in forcing a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act.",
      "Mr. Trump ran in some of the same social circles as Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, but the two had a falling out. The White House has said in the past\u00a0that the president kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago for acting like a \"creep.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled with Epstein on multiple occasions, but added he never went to Epstein's island. Clinton has said he had no knowledge of Epstein's crimes. On Monday, Clinton spokesperson Angel Ure\u00f1a called on the government to release all additional photographs or records that include the former president, arguing he has nothing to hide.",
      "\"[W]hat the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why,\" Ure\u00f1a said in a statement. \"But we do know this: We need no such protection.\"",

    "summary": "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S. this month.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is still pursuing a sanctioned oil tanker in international waters, a U.S. official told CBS News on Monday, as the Trump administration appeared to intensify its targeting of oil vessels amid a pressure campaign directed at the Venezuelan government.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker, called the Bella 1, over the weekend, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official said.",
      "But the ship \u2014 which had not yet entered Venezuelan waters \u2014 refused to be boarded and sailed away, fleeing toward the Caribbean. An active pursuit began, with the vessel sending distress signals to nearby ships. That pursuit remained underway as of Monday afternoon, according to the official.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Sunday the pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S.\u00a0this month.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "And earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0called The Skipper that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the tanker seized on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is pushing for more information on a White House ballroom project championed by President Trump, sending a series of letters Monday to the project's architect and some attendees of a fundraising dinner.",
      "The White House disclosed a partial list of those who attended the October 15 dinner, which was held to recognize financial contributors to the $400 million ballroom project. CBS News obtained a more complete list of invitees through sources.",
      "Blumenthal\u00a0asked several reported attendees who weren't on the official list\u00a0how they decided whether to donate and how much to give. He also asks if they were given the option to stay off the White House-released list, and if so, why they chose to remain anonymous.",
      "David Baszucki, the CEO of game company Roblox, did not appear on the White House list, but did attend the dinner. Blumenthal asks Baszucki to confirm in writing that he donated $5 million to back the ballroom, an amount not previously reported. The senator writes that Baszucki told him about the donation during a meeting.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson said Baszucki donated to the non-profit organization supporting the ballroom project in his personal capacity \u2014 but declined to specify the amount.",
      "Blumenthal also sent letters to Trish Duggan, a wealthy Republican donor; Robert Goldstein, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp.; Carey Smith, Parsons Corp. CEO; Dan Gilbert, Rocket Companies Chairman; Steve Rudder; Cliff Sims, a former White House official; John Solomon, Just The News editor-in-chief; TV personality Greta Van Susteren and her husband; and Geoff Verhoff, a lobbyist.",
      "Not all of the fundraising dinner's attendees have confirmed that they donated.",
      "\"Many of the donors have deep financial, business, or other personal interests before the Administration,\" Blumenthal wrote, arguing that Americans are entitled to \"all the relevant facts about who is funding the most substantial construction project at the White House in recent history.\"",
      "Roblox has faced criticism for insufficient child protections on its platform, and members of Congress have taken note. It also faces a wave of state lawsuits accusing the company of exposing minors to potentially harmful content. Tennessee sued Roblox as recently as last week.",
      "Since the October dinner, the company announced new child safety measures. Roblox has said it dedicates \"substantial resources\" to finding and taking down inappropriate content.",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power in Congress, so Blumenthal's asks amount to a request rather than a binding demand.",
      "Blumenthal also wrote to the architect who took over the ballroom project after tensions between Mr. Trump and the original architect became public.",
      "Shalom Baranes, a D.C.-based architect, was hired in early December. So far the White House has declined to share details about its financial arrangement with the firm.",
      "Blumenthal's letter asks for Baranes to provide details about how he became involved in the project, whether there is a contract between Baranes and the government and if he has shared design plans.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Dec 2025 19:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Animal rights groups celebrate, but the Trump administration is light on specifics about phasing out federally funded medical testing on animals.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. said this weekend that he is working across the government to end all federally funded animal testing.",
      "\"All the major agency heads are committed to ending animal experimentation,\" he said in an interview with Lara Trump\u00a0on Fox News, referring to research being conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy focused specifically on monkey testing, or \"non-human primate testing,\" during his remarks. There are over 100,000 monkeys in primate testing labs around the country, with more than 20,000 more being imported every year, he said.",
      "\"We are trying to put an end to that,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Earlier this year, a CBS News investigation with the South Carolina Post & Courier documented efforts to cancel nearly $28 million in federal grants for research that relied on animals. And it found that, as federal health agencies moved to phase out research on live primates, available alternatives were not yet ready for use.",
      "It was against this backdrop that scientists at the CDC were ordered last month to phase out all their monkey research, a directive first reported in the journal Science.",
      "\"Across the Trump Administration, there is a shift to prioritize animal welfare,\" a health department spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"At HHS, that includes moves to reduce unnecessary animal testing requirements and prioritizing human-based research.\"",
      "Primate testing has been an integral part of medical advancement for nearly a century, and federal regulations require that most pharmaceuticals be tested on primates before they enter human clinical studies. Experiments on monkeys are credited with major medical advancements leading to the creation of Tylenol, the COVID-19 vaccine and Ozempic, among other things.",
      "Experiments on primates make up a small portion of biomedical research overall, but Deborah Fuller, director of the NIH-funded Washington National Primate Research Center, said they are essential for developing therapies that continue to save lives.",
      "\"The majority of the biomedical interventions that we have today went through a non-human primate at some point,\" she said. \"Shutting down a non-human primate research program, you're actually shooting yourself in the foot.\"",
      "For example, 200 primates are part of CDC's ongoing research into treatments for HIV and other infectious diseases. Non-human primates are the only animals that closely model HIV infection in humans, according to Fuller.",
      "\"It is a very small slice of all of the animal research that's done. And it is only done because that is the only model that can effectively answer the question that's being addressed,\" she said.",
      "But animal rights groups, who have found allies in the Trump administration, say this type of testing is outdated.",
      "\"I think it's baseless fear-mongering to suggest we need to torture animals to improve human health. All of the available evidence suggests otherwise,\" said Justin Goodman, senior vice president of advocacy and public policy at White Coat Waste Project. The organization",
      "advocates to end all federally funded animal testing and works closely with the Trump administration to cut grant programs that rely on it.",
      "Kennedy's pledge was \"unprecedented,\" Goodman said.",
      "\"As the head of the agency that funds more animal testing than anyone else in the world, RFK's commitment to ending testing on primates and other animals is game-changing,\" he said. \"We are optimistic \u2014 but the devil is in the details.\"",
      "The details for how the federal government intends to actually end animal testing remain sparse. The fate of monkeys already in labs across the country is also unclear.",
      "Kennedy said his agency is exploring options to retire animals to sanctuaries. But there are limited facilities equipped to take in the thousands of primates that may need continued medical monitoring. The estimated cost of transporting the animals alone could cost millions of dollars, even if there were available space for the animals in question.",
      "\"We need to make sure we have space somewhere that can take care of these animals for the rest of their lives,\" said Sally Thompson-Iritani, an associate professor at the University of Washington, who helps oversee the university's animal care program. \"And we currently don't have an infrastructure that supports that.\"",
      "\"I think there's legitimately logistical issues that have to be sorted out, which is why we are anxious to hear more details from HHS about what its plans are,\" Goodman agreed, calling such an effort \"a massive undertaking.\"",
      "Moreover, some animals that have been infected with dangerous diseases like Ebola would not be able to move to a sanctuary and would likely need to be euthanized, Goodman said.",
      "Kennedy has pushed for alternatives to animal testing, suggesting that AI and computer generated models are more accurate and efficient methods for predicting health outcomes in humans. The FDA and NiH put out updated guidelines advocating for the phasing out of live animal models in favor of alternative technologies this spring.",
      "But researchers on the cutting edge of these alternatives don't believe that the new technologies are ready to completely replace primate models.",
      "\"I want to see us get out of the business of using animals in research,\" said Paul Locke in an interview with CBS News over the summer. Locke is an environmental health lawyer at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and serves on the board of the school's Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing.",
      "\"The question is when. When can we do that and reach the double goal of having better science and virtually no animals? The answer is not tomorrow.\"",

      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Monday he was \"deeply angered\" by the move and warned Washington to respect Denmark's sovereignty.",

      "The Interior Department didn't disclose the specific security issues raised by the Defense Department, instead pointing to unclassified federal reports that have found wind projects can create risks because the movement of turbine blades, combined with their reflective towers, can create radar interference.",
      "Called \"clutter,\" this radar interference can make it difficult to identify legitimate moving targets, Interior noted.",
      "The action comes two weeks after a federal judge struck down President Trump's executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and violates U.S. law.",
      "Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0executive order\u00a0blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.",

      "Halted projects",
      "Vineyard Wind 1, located about 15 miles south of the Massachusetts islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, is slated to include 62 wind turbines, each spaced by one nautical mile apart, according to the project's website. About half of those turbines were operational in October, the Vineyard Times reported that month.",
      "Once fully developed, the project is projected to generate renewable energy for more than 400,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Revolution Wind, a project located off the coast of Rhode Island, is 80% completed, according to its website. It's operated by renewable energy company Orsted, which didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Dominion Energy's CVOW, which stands for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, is the largest offshore wind project in the U.S., with 176 turbines. The project was projected to be up and running by the end of 2026, according to its website.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Dominion said the Trump administration's order threatens \"thousands of jobs\" and could create energy inflation. It added that the project would also supply energy for the nation's security apparatus and artificial intelligence data centers.",

    "story": [
      "Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest highlighted a rift in the conservative movement that's emerged since the assassination of the group's co-founder, Charlie Kirk, in September.",
      "Over the course of the four-day conference, some of the speakers criticized one another by name. Podcaster and prominent right-wing personality Ben Shapiro called out Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and Megyn Kelly and accused them of being \"frauds and grifters\" and for entertaining far-right conspiracy theories following Kirk's killing.",
      "\"The conservative movement is in danger from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty,\" Shapiro said during his remarks Thursday night. He referred to Bannon as \"a PR flack for Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "One fault line that's emerged is how to handle the rise of far-right antisemitic and white supremacist influencer Nick Fuentes after Carlson recently interviewed him on his podcast. Many conservatives were outraged at Carlson for giving Fuentes a platform, though some have defended him.",
      "At AmericaFest, Shapiro went after Carlson for hosting Fuentes \u2014 whom he called \"a Hitler apologist, Nazi-loving, anti-American piece of refuse\" \u2014 on his podcast.",
      "Bannon, in his remarks, compared Shapiro to \"a cancer\" on the conservative movement.",
      "\"Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads,\" Bannon said. \"Mark my word, he will make a move on Turning Point, because he's always been envious of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "The event was the first of its kind since Kirk was assassinated in September while speaking at a Utah university. The noticeable rift between speakers made some of the attendees uneasy.",
      "Deacon Jones, a 19-year-old Turning Point USA member from Tennessee, has attended two of the conservative group's conferences in the past, and he said this weekend's AmericaFest felt noticeably different compared to previous years after Kirk's death. Jones suggested Kirk's absence seemed to make a palpable difference.",
      "\"I I think Charlie used to be the beacon that everybody could trust; he would take everybody's ideas and kind of boil it down to something that everybody could agree with,\" Jones said. \"I think everybody's just trying to figure out, like, 'Where do we go from here? How do we figure out who to listen to, who to trust?'\"",
      "Jones was one of the more than 25,000 people who attended the conference, which took place in Phoenix, Arizona, and included prominent conservatives such as Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, Bannon, White House border czar Tom Homan, Carlson and a surprise appearance by rapper Nicki Minaj. President Trump called in to the conference by phone..",
      "Lucas Beaver, a 19-year-old Turning Point USA chapter president from North Carolina, told CBS News on Sunday that Fuentes is \"trying to grab the attention\" of the young conservatives.",
      "\"He tries to manipulate things, and in some ways, trying to hide his radicalism, in some ways, so that he can gain those people's trust,\" he said.",
      "Jones added that recent infighting is preventing the young conservative movement from finding common ground it needs to build on its momentum from 2024.",
      "\"We're making major issues minor and minor issues major. We're not talking about all the things we agree on. We're talking about all the things we're disagreeing on and splitting our party,\" Jones said.",
      "Andrew Kolvet, Turning Point's spokesman and executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" said no single figure can help resolve MAGA's internal conflict in the vacuum left by Kirk's death, adding that \"it's going to be a team effort.\" But he was hopeful about the more positive direction from Vance, who addressed the conference on Sunday, its final day.",
      "\"With JD Vance's final address, the capstone of this event. It kind of felt like, you know, Dad's home,\" Kolvet said. \"He's telling the kids to settle down. You know, here's what we stand for, here's the Northern Star, and this is what we're chasing after.\"",
      "Vance, who received Erika Kirk's endorsement for the\u00a0 2028 race, took the stage and attempted to smooth things over, telling conference-goers that the conservative movement is open to everyone as long as they \"love America.\"",
      "\"We have far more important work to do than canceling each other,\" Vance said. \"Charlie invited all of us here for a reason, because he believed that each of us, all of us, had something worth saying, and he trusted all of you to make your own judgment.\"",
      "Nick Perisse, a 19-year-old student from Florida, said he felt \"carefully enthusiastic\" about the future of the young conservative movement following Vance's remarks.",
      "\"Vice President Vance not only fulfilled all my previous expectations, he also exceeded them by delivering a uniting message that resonated very strongly with both diehard MAGA supporters and skeptics,\" Perisse told CBS News. \"I'm hopeful for what we can and will do for our country, but we must be careful not to let these internal disagreements and divisions cause us to collapse against ourselves.\"",

      "The Department of Homeland Security has tripled its \"exit bonus\" for undocumented migrants who voluntarily depart the United States through self-deportation, increasing the financial incentive from $1,000 to $3,000 for those who register with the U.S. government and depart the country by the end of the calendar year.",
      "DHS says all qualified participants who leave by Dec. 31, 2025, will also receive free airfare to their home countries and be waived of certain civil fines or penalties tied to remaining illegally in the U.S., if they voluntarily self-deport using the rebranded CBP Home app. The smartphone app is modeled off the Biden administration's CBP One platform.",
      "Under the Trump administration's policy, migrants are instructed to use the platform to signal their intent to depart. If determined to be eligible, DHS officials say they will receive travel assistance plus the $3,000 paid stipend once the U.S. government confirms the individual has left the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says that those who do not take advantage of the temporary incentive will be \"found,\" \"arrested\" and \"never return\" to the U.S.",
      "The CBP One app was originally built under the previous administration to schedule asylum appointments, but under the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda, it has been remodeled under a voluntary departure framework to permit those without lawful status to track their exit.",
      "DHS says the bonus stipend is part of a holiday season campaign aimed at accelerating removals and reducing taxpayer costs, with travel support typically considered less expensive than traditional detention and deportation operations. As of May 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated the average cost to arrest, detain and remove an undocumented migrant is approximately $17,000.",
      "As part of the self-deportation program, DHS says participants are deprioritized for ICE arrest and detention so long as they demonstrate \"meaningful strides\" toward leaving the U.S., though officials have not released detailed guidance explaining how long that protection lasts or how any compliance is judged.",
      "While ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrests nationwide are largely considered the most visible arm of the Trump administration's sweeping immigration crackdown, the president has simultaneously pushed to compel self-deportation of families and unaccompanied children who entered the country without permission.",
      "In October, the U.S. government announced plans to grant migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they choose to return to their home countries voluntarily, CBS News previously reported.",
      "DHS says that since January 2025, 1.9 million undocumented immigrants have \"voluntarily self-deported,\" with \"tens of thousands\" doing so through the CBP Home program specifically. Those figures have not been independently verified by CBS News, and DHS has not publicly released a detailed breakdown showing how many individuals received government-funded travel or stipends versus those who departed on their own.",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:00:35 -0500",
    "summary": "More see Trump's policies responsible for economy today than Biden's; there are also concerns about AI impact on jobs.",
    "story": [
      "As 2025 wraps up, it's another in a string of years after the 2020 pandemic in which most Americans consistently voiced negative views about the economy amid ongoing concerns about costs \u2014 a topic that looks poised to dominate 2026, too.",
      "That's because in the eyes of many Americans today, the U.S. is an expensive place to live. Relatively few describe basics like food and housing today as easy to afford, while housing and health care, in particular, are described by more as \"difficult\" to afford than easy.",
      "Against that backdrop, persuading the wider public that things are improved \u2014 as President Trump aimed to do this past week \u2014 sets up a challenge for him going into 2026.",
      "Expectations aren't that high for the impact of his policies to make them better off in 2026, and many don't think that happened in 2025.",
      "Fewer than one in five say Mr. Trump's policies made them financially better in 2025. Outlook on that for 2026 is better by comparison, but still isn't widespread.",
      "And it still pales compared to 2025's expectations. Just ahead of him being sworn in, more expected Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off.",
      "Either way, in the public mind, it is more Mr. Trump's economy than Joe Biden's.",
      "Adding to his challenges: the Americans who give the economy bad grades are even more likely to hold him responsible.",
      "That's maybe partly about what he's done \u2014 people who oppose new tariffs, for example, are especially likely to call it his economy \u2014 but also what they think he hasn't done.\u00a0Those who feel he hasn't put enough focus on lowering prices are even more likely to say this economy is his alone.",
      "The president did halt a months-long steady decline in his handling of the economy and inflation. Each is still low, but now up from the lows of this term recorded in November. His overall approval saw the same dynamic, back up one point.",
      "Most still feel he describes things as better than they really are. That hasn't changed.",
      "On balance, Americans mostly grade the economy as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse.",
      "But plenty of people say their views of the president's job performance could change in the new year \u2014 that he could do something to change their minds. That includes a quarter of those who disapprove of Mr. Trump's performance now.",
      "Most of them say that it would have to do with the economy.",
      "All interviewing for this poll was done following the address to the nation on Wednesday night.",
      "Trump\u00a0 drew plenty of support in 2024 from voters in middle-income ranges, but today two-thirds of Americans say he favors the wealthy, not the middle class \u2014 and that number is higher than it was this spring.",
      "Meanwhile, a range of issues swirl ahead of 2026 that could impact people's bottom lines next year. These include the rise of AI, the impact of deportation efforts (including on jobs), and health care policy, which is looming large.",
      "AI",
      "When looking at a range of different aspects of the U.S. economy, Americans tend to be most optimistic about the technology sector. (more than housing or manufacturing, for instance).",
      "At the same time, there's a lot of skepticism about AI's impact, even as it drives the stock market and investments at ever-higher rates in one of the year's biggest economic stories.",
      "A majority think AI will decrease American jobs, not increase them.",
      "On balance, people would have government policy restrict, not promote, AI.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "The deportation program continues to divide the country, and it is also connected in the public mind to an impact on the economy and jobs. A sizable number \u2014 especially those who approve of it \u2014 believe jobs that were done by those being deported will now be done by citizens or legal immigrants.",
      "Most who disapprove of the deportation program think those jobs will go unfilled.",
      "Most continue to say border crossings are down this year. It's one reason the president's approval ratings on handling immigration has been higher than his ratings for handling the economy this year.",
      "Health care",
      "Most Americans would like to see the ACA tax credits extended, including more than four in 10 Republicans.",
      "A big majority think the administration's policies are making health insurance costs go up.",
      "Heading into his latest announcement of a recent deal with drug makers, the public was not convinced yet of the president's approach to lowering drug prices \u2014 more think he's making costs go up than down.",
      "On the international front",
      "People don't expect Mr. Trump's policies to have any more impact on peace and stability than they perceived in 2025, and a large majority still says Mr. Trump needs to explain what's going on with Venezuela.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,300 U.S. adults interviewed between December 17-19, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "published": "Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:10:22 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA is gearing up to send four Artemis astronauts on looping test flight around the moon in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "Four astronauts in training to fly around the moon early next year strapped into their Orion spacecraft this weekend for a dress rehearsal countdown in a major milestone toward launch.",
      "Based on repeated stops and starts seen on NASA's countdown clock, the complex test originally planned for late November, ran into problems at various points on Saturday. NASA provided no details, but Artemis 2 commander Reid Wiseman said that overall, the test went well.",
      "\"Extremely successful day in our spacecraft #Integrity,\" Wiseman said in a post on X. \"Did everything go perfectly? Absolutely not. But this vehicle and our team showed us they're up to the challenge. Launch is getting very close.\"",
      "Launch is tentatively targeted for early February, but the schedule is extremely tight and the flight may slip to early March. No decisions are expected until after the first of next year.",
      "In any case, Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen, wearing bright orange pressure suits, strapped into their Orion capsule using the same procedures they'll follow on launch day.",
      "Such \"countdown demonstration tests\" have traditionally taken place shortly before launch with the rocket and crew ship already on the launch pad. But for Saturday's test, the astronauts boarded their spacecraft atop NASA's huge Space Launch System (SLS) rocket inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Over the course of the exercise, the astronauts and the launch control team worked through the same countdown procedures they will follow on launch day, ending less than a minute before the clocks would normally hit zero.",
      "Five launch opportunities are available in February when the moon and Earth are in the proper relative positions. The first such opportunity comes on Feb. 6. To make that date, the SLS rocket and Orion would have to be rolled from the assembly building to pad 39B in mid January, setting the stage for a critical fueling test that must go well before NASA can proceed to launch.",
      "Given the amount of work remaining to complete preparations, sources say NASA may opt to delay the flight to early March.",
      "Whenever it takes off, the flight plan calls for the Orion and its crew to spend 25 hours in an elliptical orbit around Earth to test spacecraft life support, propulsion and navigation systems.",
      "The crew plans to fly in close proximity to the SLS rocket's upper stage to test the Orion's maneuvering systems and rendezvous procedures that will be needed for eventual moon landing missions.",
      "An uncrewed Orion carried out a similar loop around the moon during the Artemis 1 mission in November 2022. But the Lockheed Martin-built spacecraft was not equipped with a full life support system and it did not carry out thruster firings like those needed for a rendezvous.",
      "Once the testing is complete, the Artemis 2 Orion will leave Earth orbit on a \"free return\" trajectory that will carry the crew around the moon and back to a Pacific Ocean splashdown. The ship will not go into orbit around the moon.",
      "But Artemis 2 will still be the first piloted trip back to the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, carrying Wiseman and his crewmates farther from Earth than any other humans have ever traveled.",
      "The flight will set the stage for Artemis 3, carrying yet-to-be-named astronauts to the surface of the moon near the lunar south pole, NASA hopes, in 2028.",
      "The Artemis 3 flight originally was planned for 2024, a target set during the first Trump administration. But the mission has been repeatedly delayed by processing problems, slowdowns during the COVID pandemic, Super Heavy-Starship testing and work to develop the lunar lander, known by NASA as the Human Landing System, or HLS.",
      "The current 2028 target was set in the past few weeks when it became apparent the space agency would not be ready in time for the most recent previous target of 2027.",
      "China also plans to land its own \"taikonauts\" on the moon by 2030, creating a new space race of sorts, one that NASA vows to win.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:21:27 -0500",
    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",

      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",
      "The investigation also found\u00a0that Instacart was conducting algorithmic pricing tests using product information from Target. The retail giant told CBS News it has no commercial relationship with Instacart and that it was not involved in the pilot.",
      "Instacart acquired Eversight, an AI-enabled pricing platform, in 2022, and began offering pricing software to retail companies in 2023.",
      "Instacart claims the AI pricing tests did not include customers' personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral characteristics. The decision to end the use of its pricing tool was made in response to feedback from Instacart customers, a company spokesperson said Monday.",
      "Retailers will continue to set their own prices on the delivery website, and they may still offer different prices at different brick-and-mortar locations, Instacart said Monday in a blog\u00a0post.",

    "summary": "Rapid emergence of AI will foster demand for new types of workers, including \"explainers\" and bias auditors, according to economist Robert Seamans.",
    "story": [
      "Workers with an aptitude for explaining how artificial intelligence tools function in simple terms are more likely to find success in the job market, according to an economist who focuses on the economic impact of AI.",
      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",
      "\"My encouragement would be for everyone to play around with AI and not assume there is one specific way you should be interacting with [AI],\" he said. \"Interact in a variety of ways because you'll get different answers.\"",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",

      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports.

      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",

    "summary": "The declaration issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of 19 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday sued the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, its secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and its inspector general over a declaration that could complicate access to gender-affirming care for young people.",
      "The declaration issued last Thursday called treatments like puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries unsafe and ineffective for children and adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria, or the distress when someone's gender expression doesn't match their sex assigned at birth. It also warned doctors that they could be excluded from federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid if they provide those types of care.",
      "The declaration came as HHS also announced proposed rules meant to further curtail gender-affirming care for young people, although the lawsuit doesn't address those as they are not final.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that the declaration is inaccurate and unlawful and asks the court to block its enforcement. It's the latest in a series of clashes between an administration that's cracking down on transgender health care for children, arguing it can be harmful to them, and advocates who say the care is medically necessary and shouldn't be inhibited. After taking office in January, President Trump signed an executive order that seeks to cut federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy cannot unilaterally change medical standards by posting a document online, and no one should lose access to medically necessary health care because their federal government tried to interfere in decisions that belong in doctors' offices,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the lawsuit, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that HHS's declaration seeks to coerce providers to stop providing gender-affirming care and circumvent legal requirements for policy changes. It says federal law requires the public to be given notice and an opportunity to comment before substantively changing health policy \u2014 neither of which, the suit says, was done before the declaration was issued.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.",
      "HHS's declaration based its conclusions on a peer-reviewed report that the department conducted earlier this year that urged greater reliance on behavioral therapy rather than broad gender-affirming care for youths with gender dysphoria.",
      "The report questioned standards for the treatment of transgender youth issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and raised concerns that adolescents may be too young to give consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility.",
      "Major medical groups and those who treat transgender young people have sharply criticized the report as inaccurate, and most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, continue to oppose restrictions on transgender care and services for young people.",
      "The declaration was announced as part of a multifaceted effort to limit gender-affirming health care for children and teenagers \u2014 and built on other Trump administration efforts to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "HHS on Thursday also unveiled two proposed federal rules \u2014 one to cut off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children, and another to prohibit federal Medicaid dollars from being used for such procedures.",
      "The proposals are not yet final or legally binding and must go through a lengthy rulemaking process and public comment before becoming permanent. But they will nonetheless likely further discourage health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children.",
      "Several major medical providers already have pulled back on gender-affirming care for young patients since Mr. Trump returned to office \u2014 even in states where the care is legal and protected by state law.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care. The Supreme Court's recent 6-3 decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first time the Supreme Court had waded into the issue of health care for transgender youth.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18.",
      "The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.",
      "Joining James in Tuesday's lawsuit were Democratic attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Washington and the District of Columbia.

    "story": [
      "A small Mexican navy plane on a medical mission crashed Monday near Galveston, Texas, killing at least six people, including a 2-year-old, officials said.",
      "Two people were taken to the hospital, the U.S. Coast Guard said earlier. There was no immediate word on their condition. One passenger, a 27-year-old, was uninjured, the Coast Guard said. It was unclear if that person was one of the two who had been taken to the hospital. One person who had been missing was found dead Tuesday, the Mexican navy said.",
      "The Mexican navy said the plane, a twin turboprop Beech King Air 350i, had been carrying eight people: four navy officers and four civilians. In addition to the 2-year-old, the victims included his doctor and the four members of the Mexican navy.",
      "The plane was helping with a medical mission in coordination with the Michou and Mau Foundation, a nonprofit that provides emergency transports to children with life-threatening burns to Shriners Children's hospital in Galveston.",
      "The foundation said in a post on social media, \"We express our deepest solidarity with the families in light of these events. We share their grief with respect and compassion, honoring their memory and reaffirming our commitment to providing humane, sensitive, and dignified care to children with burns.\"",
      "The crash took place Monday around 3:17 p.m. local time near the base of a causeway near Galveston, along the Texas coast about 50 miles southeast of Houston. Flight tracking data shows the plane took off from Merida International Airport in Merida, Mexico. It crossed the Gulf and swung around to approach the Galveston airport before disappearing from radar while over Galveston Bay.",
      "Sky Decker, a professional yacht captain who lives about a mile from the crash site, said he jumped in his boat with his 11-year-old son to see if he could help. He said he picked up two police officers who directed him through thick fog.",
      "\"We just saw a crushed ball of aluminum,\" Decker told CBS News. \"It appeared to me that there would be no way that anybody could be alive inside of the wreckage because it was almost fully submerged too.\"",
      "Decker jumped in the water and found a badly injured woman, a nurse named Miriam Mancilla, trapped beneath chairs and other debris. Dramatic cell phone video shows him moving debris out of the way to help free her.",
      "\"I couldn't believe. She had maybe 3 inches of air gap to breathe in,\" he said. \"And there was jet fuel in there mixed with the water, fumes real bad. She was really fighting for her life.\"",
      "\"She was in a dire situation,\" Decker told CBS News.",
      "He said he also pulled out a man sitting in front of her who had already died. He described both of them as dressed in civilian clothes.",
      "Asked how he felt about people calling him a hero, Decker told CBS News, \"I just think I was the right guy to be there at the right time. That I'm comfortable with the water and God put me there at the right time to save that woman.\"",
      "The cause of the crash is under investigation. It wasn't immediately clear if weather was a factor. However, the area has been experiencing foggy conditions over the past few days, according to Cameron Batiste, a National Weather Service meteorologist.",
      "He said that at about 2:30 p.m. Monday, a fog came in that had about a half-mile visibility.",

    "story": [
      "The man accused of shooting two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., last month has been charged with five additional federal felonies, according to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national, is now facing charges of first-degree premeditated murder while armed, assault with intent to kill while armed, possession of a firearm during a crime of violence or dangerous offense, transporting or receiving firearms in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent to commit an offense, and transporting or shipping a stolen firearm in interstate or foreign commerce.",
      "Lakanwal had previously been charged with\u00a0murder, assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence for the shooting in Washington, D.C., Superior Court. He pleaded not guilty to those charges and has a court appearance scheduled for Jan. 2.",
      "Lakanwal is accused of shooting\u00a0Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom\u00a0and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, both members of the West Virginia National Guard who had been deployed to the nation's capital, in an ambush-style attack on Nov. 26. Beckstrom, 20, was shot in the head and died from her wounds the next day.",
      "Wolfe, 24, was also shot in the head and critically wounded. As of earlier this month, he was able to breathe on his own and could stand with assistance. His medical team said on Dec. 12 that he was ready to transition from acute care to inpatient rehabilitation, noting in a statement that he had made \"extraordinary progress.\"",
      "Lakanwal was shot and wounded by another National Guard member during the attack and was taken into custody by the Secret Service, according to Tuesday's criminal complaint. He was hospitalized and initially placed on a ventilator. He made his first court appearance virtually from the hospital.",
      "According to the complaint, the .357 Smith & Wesson revolver used in the shooting was legally purchased in Washington state by somebody else, who had died in 2023. Lakanwal allegedly tried to buy several other guns, including an AR-15 and a \"Draco\" or \"compact, AK-47-style, stockless pistol,\" claiming he needed them for protection for his job as a rideshare driver. On Nov. 14, he was eventually able to buy the revolver used in the shooting, the complaint alleged, which had been stolen from the original owner's home several months after his death.",
      "The complaint notes that Washington state law stipulates all firearm sales, \"including private transfers\u2014must be conducted through a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL), which requires the purchaser to complete ATF Form 4473 and to undergo a state background check.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges Lakanwal bought ammo for the revolver the next day and then searched for \"Washington, D.C.\" and \"The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500\" in Google Maps.",
      "Lakanwal entered the United States in 2021, multiple law enforcement sources previously told CBS News. He came to the U.S. under a Biden-era program for Afghan nationals called Operation Allies Welcome, according to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. He and his family fled Taliban threats in Afghanistan's Khost province and relocated to Kabul before being transferred to the United States, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The Education Department signaled earlier this year that it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is set to resume garnishing the wages of some student loan borrowers who are in default beginning in early 2026, and a leading advocacy group for student loan borrowers is raising concerns.",
      "Wage garnishment notices are expected to go out to about 1,000 borrowers in default beginning the week of Jan. 7, according to The Associated Press, with the number of notices expected to increase on a monthly basis after that.",
      "The Education Department said in a statement to The AP that it would begin involuntary collection \"only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of their wages those in default could see garnished.",
      "\"At a time when families across the country are struggling with stagnant wages and an affordability crisis, this Administration's decision to garnish wages from defaulted student loan borrowers is cruel, unnecessary, and irresponsible,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel of the student borrower advocacy group Protect Borrowers. \"As millions of borrowers sit on the precipice of default, this Administration is using its self-inflicted limited resources to seize borrowers' wages instead of defending borrowers' right to affordable payments.\"",
      "Federal student loan borrowers are considered in default after missing payments for at least 270 days. Borrowers in default must be given at least 30 days' notice before their wages can be garnished.",
      "Student loan repayments were paused, with no interest accruing, by the first Trump administration in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. After several extensions under the Biden administration, payments were required to resume in Oct. 2023 after Congress blocked further extensions.",
      "In May of this year, the Education Department signaled it would move to resume wage garnishment, among other forms of involuntary collection, for those in default.",
      "More than 5 million borrowers were in default when the Education Department said in May it would begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which uses measures such as withholding tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. The department predicted 4 million more could be in default in the months that followed, which would mean nearly 25% of all student loan borrowers would be in default.",
      "Former President Joe Biden attempted to forgive student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his term, but the effort was repeatedly\u00a0rejected by courts, including a\u00a02023 ruling by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration was able to wipe out student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through\u00a0other forgiveness programs.",
      "In May's announcement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said, \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment \u2014 both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday.",
      "\"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness,\" the announcement said.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump\u00a0signed into law on July 4\u00a0also overhauled the federal student loan system, phasing out several repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR, capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education, and eliminating deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked a law called Title 10 to bring members of the Illinois National Guard under federal service over the objections of state and local leaders.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by the Trump administration to deploy National Guard members to the Chicago area while a legal challenge moves forward, delivering a setback to President Trump in his effort to use federalized troops in Illinois to ensure enforcement of federal immigration laws.",
      "The high court left untouched a judge's decision blocking the government from putting National Guard members on the streets of Chicago and surrounding areas. The Trump administration had urged the Supreme Court to allow the extraordinary move to deploy the troops over the objection of Illinois' Democratic governor, arguing that federal courts cannot second-guess the president's decision to call the National Guard into federal service.",
      "But the Supreme Court declined the administration's request to freeze that order in a decision that appears to be 6-3. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented.",
      "In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court found that \"at least in this posture\" the Trump administration has not met its burden to show that Title 10, the law Mr. Trump invoked, permits him to federalize the National Guard \"in the exercise of inherent authority to protect federal personnel and property in Illinois.\"",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker issued a statement calling the ruling \"a big win for Illinois and American democracy.\"\u00a0Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the Supreme Court for \"rebuking President Trump's attempts to militarize and demonize our city.\"",
      "The White House said nothing in the high court's ruling detracts from the president's agenda.",
      "\"The president promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. \"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property. Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has brought state-run National Guards under federal control in several U.S. cities as his administration has ramped up immigration enforcement operations. Mr. Trump has so far moved to deploy National Guard units in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland and Chicago to protect federal property and personnel, and he has threatened to send troops to other major cities, including Baltimore and San Francisco.",
      "Two West Virginia National Guard members who were sent to Washington, D.C., were shot in an ambush-style attack near the White House last month. One of the victims died and the other was severely wounded.",
      "As for Illinois, the president issued a memo in early October claiming that federal facilities in the state \"have come under coordinated assault by violent groups intent on obstructing federal law enforcement activities,\" which he said hindered the execution of U.S. immigration laws.",
      "The directive came after the processing center for immigrant detainees in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, saw a rise in protests following the launch of an immigration enforcement campaign called Operation Midway Blitz in early September.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump authorized the federalization of the Illinois National Guard under\u00a0Title 10. The law allows the president to call into federal service members of a state's Guard when he cannot execute U.S. laws with the \"regular forces\" or when there is a \"rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the government.",
      "Roughly 300 troops from the Illinois National Guard prepared to mobilize. Federalized members of the Texas and California National Guards also arrived in Illinois in early October but have since left the state.",
      "Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker objected to the president's move, arguing that there was no public safety need that required the deployment of National Guard troops. The state of Illinois and city of Chicago then sued the Trump administration, arguing Mr. Trump's federalization of the National Guard is illegal. They sought a temporary order barring the government from mobilizing and sending troops to the Chicago area.",
      "U.S. District Judge April Perry sided with Illinois officials and issued a temporary order blocking the Trump administration from ordering the federalization and deployment of the National Guard within Illinois. In her October decision, she called information from Department of Homeland Security officials about events in Illinois \"unreliable.\"",
      "\"There has been no showing that the civil power has failed,\" Perry wrote. \"The agitators who have violated the law by attacking federal authorities have been arrested. The courts are open, and the marshals are ready to see that any sentences of imprisonment are carried out. Resort to the military to execute the laws is not called for.\"",
      "A unanimous panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit then allowed the Guard members to remain under federal service, but upheld the portion of Perry's order forbidding them from being sent out to the Chicago area.",
      "In their decision, the 7th Circuit judges found that the Trump administration failed to satisfy the conditions for invoking Title 10 to call the National Guard into federal service in Illinois.",
      "\"Political opposition is not rebellion,\" the 7th Circuit judges wrote. \"A protest does not become a rebellion merely because the protestors advocate for myriad legal or policy changes, are well organized, call for significant changes to the structure of the U.S. government, use civil disobedience as a form of protest, or exercise their Second Amendment right to carry firearms as the law currently allows.\"",
      "The 7th Circuit also found there is \"insufficient evidence\" that the demonstrations in Illinois have hampered the ability of federal officers to enforce immigration laws.",
      "\"Federal facilities, including the processing facility in Broadview, have remained open despite regular demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies,\" the judges said. \"And though federal officers have encountered sporadic disruptions, they have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, the Trump administration argued that courts cannot review the president's decision to call up the National Guard.",
      "\"A federal district court lacks not only the authority but also the competence to wrest control of the military chain of command from the Commander in Chief and to adjudicate whether the Governor of Illinois, rather than the President, should be in ultimate command of particular Guardsmen after the President has called them into federal service,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Sauer also argued violence and threats of violence have impeded immigration enforcement operations and forced the Department of Homeland Security to divert resources away from law enforcement activities to protect federal buildings and officers.",
      "\"The National Guard's deployment would protect lives and federal property, deter acts of violence, free up resources for actual law enforcement, and assist federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties effectively,\" he said.",
      "Illinois officials, meanwhile, argued that state and local law enforcement have effectively handled the protests outside the Broadview facility. They warned that allowing National Guard troops onto the streets in the Chicago area could spark confrontations.",
      "\"[T]he unnecessary deployment of military troops, untrained for local policing, will escalate tensions and undermine the ordinary law enforcement activities of state and local entities, which would need to divert resources to maintain safety and order,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in mid-October, but the high court sought additional information from government lawyers and Illinois officials about whether the term \"regular forces\" refers to the U.S. military.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority concluded that the phrase \"regular forces\" likely means the military, so Title 10 likely applies only where the military can legally execute the laws. Those circumstances are \"exceptional,\" the high court said in its order, since the military is forbidden under a law called the Posse Comitatus Act from engaging in domestic law enforcement, except when authorized by Congress or the Constitution.",
      "\"So before the President can federalize the Guard under [Title 10], he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be 'unable' with those forces to perform that function,\" the court said. \"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois.\"",
      "Beyond Illinois, Mr. Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles and Portland has set off legal challenges brought by officials in those states. Two trial court judges in California and Oregon initially blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard units to areas of those states. But separate three-judge panels on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit issued decisions allowing the Trump administration to deploy members of the California National Guard within Los Angeles and the Oregon National Guard in Portland while the legal proceedings continued.",
      "The full 9th Circuit declined to reconsider the panel's decision as to the California National Guard. A district judge in December then again blocked the Trump administration's deployment, and that order has been appealed.",
      "But as to Oregon, a federal judge held a three-day trial and issued a ruling last month finding that the president did not have a lawful basis to federalize the National Guard.

    "summary": "Job listings for store Santas have plunged in recent years as more families shop online and retailers look to contain costs, a new analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "As if donning an itchy red suit and entertaining kids all day weren't a tough enough gig, the nation's professional Santa Clauses face another cheer-sapping challenge this holiday season: getting a job.",
      "Job listings for store Santas are down 35% this year, compared with 2024, according to Revelio Labs. Indeed, the number of postings at malls, stores and other outlets has fallen sharply since 2022, the workforce research firm found.",
      "The reasons: Employers are cutting budgets, more malls are closing their doors, and many parents these days choose to avoid the crowds \u2014 and the experience of plopping an unsuspecting toddler on a store Santa's lap \u2014 in favor of online shopping.",
      "The drop in Santa job postings comes amid generally soft holiday-season hiring this year as retailers look to contain costs. The nation's unemployment rate surged to 4.6% in November, the highest in more than four years.",
      "The news isn't all bad for Santa wannabes. Although fewer places are hiring, pay is improving \u2014 the median hourly wage for Santa jobs is now $25, up from $21.89 in 2022, Revelio found.",
      "Then again, employers want only the most qualified candidates. Roughly 70% of listings for store Santas this year require a real beard, according to the firm, up from only 14% three years ago.",
      "\"Economists call this a composition effect: The average salary is changing, not because the actual pay is rising, but because of who's left in the hiring pool,\" Revelio said. \"As employers require real beards for most positions, they're hiring only from the higher-paid tier. Average wages climb, but it's not a story of rising pay. It's a shrinking labor market dressed up as good news.\"",

      "\"Effective immediately, Instacart is ending all item price tests on our platform,\" an Instacart spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement. \"Retailers will no longer be able to use Eversight technology to run item price tests on Instacart.\"",

      "The organizations based their findings on data gathered from more than 400 volunteers during online shopping sessions in September. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins varied by as much as 23%.",
      "\"Once we pulled back the curtain on Instacart's hidden pricing experiments, the company had no choice but to close the lab,\" Groundwork Collaborative's executive director Lindsay Owens said in a statement on Monday.",

The latest figures are close to the group's reading in April, when President Trump announced tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"Despite an upward revision in November related to the end of the shutdown, consumer confidence fell again in December and remained well below this year's January peak. Four of five components of the overall index fell, while one was at a level signaling notable weakness,\" Dana Peterson, chief Economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "A measure of Americans' short-term expectations for their income, business conditions and the job market remained stable at 70.7, but still well below 80, the marker that can signal a recession ahead. It was the 11th consecutive month that reading has come in under 80.",
      "Consumers' assessments of their current economic situation tumbled 9.5 points to 116.8. Write-in responses to the survey showed that prices and inflation remained consumers' biggest concern, along with tariffs.",
      "Perceptions of the job market also declined this month. The conference board's survey reported that 26.7% of consumers said jobs were \"plentiful,\" down from 28.2% in November. Also, 20.8% of consumers said jobs were \"hard to get,\" up from 20.1% last month.",
      "\"Consumers' write-in responses on factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade and politics,\" Peterson said. \"However, December saw increases in mentions of immigration, war and topics related to personal finances \u2014 including interest rates, taxes and income, banks, and insurance.",
      "Americans remain generally sour about the economy, with most grading the nation's economic performance this year as either a \"C\" or \"D\" or worse, according to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll.",
      "\"Consumer confidence continued to tumble at the end of the year, as higher prices, a weaker labor market and the waning impact of the government shutdown weighed on household perceptions of the economy,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at investment adviser Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Consumers' perceptions of the current state of the economy are at their lowest point in five years,\" he added.",
      "Consumers still spending",
      "Consumer sentiment continued to ebb last month even as the economy accelerated. Federal data released on Tuesday showed the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a blistering 4.3% annual pace in the third quarter, up from 3.8% in the previous quarter and the strongest rate of growth in two years.",
      "\"The latest GDP data confirm that even though consumer confidence is slipping, consumers are still spending,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a report. \"The disconnect must mean that incomes are rising briskly. \u00a0But the payroll report says incomes are slowing. So the data are not sending a clear message right now.\"",

      "The Trump administration has mounted a nationwide campaign to void the asylum claims of thousands of immigrants with active cases in immigration court by arguing that they can be deported to countries that are not their own, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "The effort appears to have intensified in recent weeks, targeting asylum-seekers with pending cases in immigration courts in Atlanta, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Texas and elsewhere across the U.S., multiple immigration lawyers and certified legal representatives told CBS News.",
      "Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch. Instead, they are administrative entities run by the Justice Department, which employs and oversees the judges that adjudicate the cases of people facing deportation. Lawyers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement represent the government in the proceedings.",
      "The administration's new tactic involves ICE attorneys asking the immigration judges to toss out asylum claims without hearing them on the merits. In these requests, known as \"pretermit\" motions, ICE argues that asylum-seekers fearing persecution in their home countries can instead be deported to one of several nations the Trump administration has persuaded to accept deportees who are not their citizens.",
      "As part of the effort, ICE attorneys have asked immigration judges to order asylum-seekers deported to third countries like Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Uganda, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News and interviews with immigration lawyers. If granted, those petitions nullify asylum-seekers' claims and clear the way for them to be deported to third countries, absent any appeals.",
      "Previously undisclosed internal government data obtained by CBS News indicates that, as of early December, ICE attorneys had filed more than 8,000 motions in immigration court to toss out asylum claims by citing deportation agreements with third countries.",
      "The campaign is the latest move by President Trump to sharply curtail access to the American asylum system, which his administration has argued is being systematically abused by migrants who came to the U.S. for economic reasons, especially those who entered illegally along the southern border under the Biden administration.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration is \"working to get illegal aliens out of our country as quickly as possible while ensuring they receive all available legal process, including a hearing before an immigration judge.\"",
      "\"DHS is using every lawful tool available to address the backlog and abuse of the asylum system,\" the department added, citing \"lawful bilateral arrangements that allow illegal aliens seeking asylum in the United States to pursue protection in a partner country that has agreed to fairly adjudicate their claims.\"",
      "The Trump administration's strategy rests on a section of immigration law that disqualifies migrants from asylum if the applicant is eligible to request legal protection in another nation that has agreed to a \"safe third country\" arrangement with the U.S.",
      "In late October, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which reviews decisions by immigration courts, issued a ruling that lawyers believe will turbocharge efforts by the government to use \"safe third country\" agreements to cancel asylum cases. That order directed immigration judges to decide the motions by ICE to send immigrants to third-party countries before reviewing their asylum applications. It also placed the burden on asylum-seekers to prove they should not be sent to a third country because of fears of being persecuted there.",
      "\"You just have to give up\"",
      "While the Trump administration has argued its latest effort is meant to curb asylum fraud, multiple immigration lawyers told CBS News the campaign has affected clients with strong asylum claims who fled persecution in countries like Iran, Nicaragua and Russia.",
      "The attorneys argued the government's campaign is designed to eliminate the path to asylum in the U.S. Some said it is meant to coerce asylum-seekers into withdrawing their claims, by scaring them with the prospect of being deported to a country that is not their own.",
      "\"They see the asylum system as a whole as a problem, because it impedes them from deporting people in a quick manner,\" said Pa\u00fal Pirela, an immigration lawyer in Houston.",
      "\"If you want to apply for asylum, we're forcing you to apply in a country that you've never been to,\" Pirela continued. \"You just have to give up and go back to your country or go somewhere else,\" he added later.",
      "Pirela said one of his clients, a Nicaraguan asylum-seeker and political dissident, was ordered deported to Honduras after the government filed a pretermit motion in his case. ICE, he added, is also trying to get another client, an asylum applicant from Guatemala, ordered deported to Honduras.",
      "Atlanta immigration attorney Adriana Heffley got notice that DHS had motioned to pretermit her client's case and deport him to Uganda four days before a hearing, she told CBS News. Her client is from Iran, and was apprehended at the border when he entered the U.S. illegally last December, she said. He has been detained ever since.",
      "Heffley and her client had prepared a case arguing that he would face persecution and danger in Iran as someone who had previously been in same-sex relationships. But they had to switch gears and quickly prove he would also suffer in Uganda. The judge agreed and denied the DHS motion to preempt the case.",
      "\"Immigrants who are coming up on a hearing that will determine the course of the rest of their lives and their fate and their safety are being hit with this left-field motion just a day or two before that final hearing,\" Heffley said.",
      "New York immigration attorney David Treyster is not confident his case will see the same outcome. DHS moved to deport his client, a Russian national, and her 4-year-old child, to Uganda, he told CBS News. The judge initially planned to give Treyster 30 minutes to confer with her before hearing opposing arguments and ruling on the motion. After pleading with the judge, Treyster was able to schedule the hearing for Tuesday.",
      "The judge \"seemed to imply that her hands are being tied,\" he said, given the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling that the third-country deportations must be considered first. \"We haven't even had our hearing, [but] the judge kept saying, 'you're going to have to appeal this.'\"",
      "\"The person timely and properly applied for asylum and is in line waiting their turn, doing everything that the administration wants people to do, reporting to their court hearings, filing all their papers on time, and here we are just taking that due process away from them,\" Treyster added.",
      "Some immigration attorneys are challenging the tactic in court, including the 2019 regulation that ICE attorneys have been citing in their motions arguing that asylum-seekers can be deported to third countries.",
      "\"I think that this is in line with this administration's attempt to completely eviscerate the availability of asylum and other forms of protection in this country,\" said Blaine Bookey, legal director for San Francisco's Center for Gender and Refugee Studies, one of the groups litigating the case. \"This is, in their view, an easy way to cut off a case at the knees.\"",

      "Core PCE, which excludes the more volatile food and energy categories, grew 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the previous quarter. Both are above the Federal Reserve's annual inflation target of 2%.",
      "The economy has shown resilience this year.

Some retailers have cushioned the blow for shoppers by absorbing the added costs, while others have passed them on through higher prices.",

    "published": "Tue, 23 Dec 2025 09:49:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Doctors and scientists say this year's influenza season could be tougher than usual, with a new version of the flu virus, called H3N2, spreading quickly.",
    "story": [
      "Doctors and scientists say this year's influenza season could be tougher than usual. A new version of the flu virus, called H3N2, is spreading quickly. At the same time, fewer people are getting flu shots.",
      "\"This flu season is no joke. We are seeing more cases than we would expect for this time of year,\" Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, said on \"CBS Mornings.\" Specifically, she explained, \"we are seeing influenza A, and within influenza A we are seeing a subtype or variant called H3N2.\"",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 17 jurisdictions are reporting \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of flu.",
      "\"It's pretty likely to be an H3N2-dominated flu season,\" said Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution. \"I don't see any reason to think that this is an unprecedentedly bad one, but current indicators are that it may be substantially more severe than the typical winter flu season.\"",
      "Bloom said the H3N2 virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize, but a flu shot could still help.",
      "\"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do,\" he explained. \"It's not going to eliminate their chance of getting infected, but it does mitigate their risk.\"",
      "A changing virus",
      "Other experts share Bloom's concern. \"I would say pretty worried,\" said Dr. Helen Chu, a flu expert at the University of Washington. \"Based on the U.K. and Japan data, it's looking like it's causing a lot of cases of flu and hospitalizations.\"",
      "She said flu activity \"is starting everywhere right now,\" overlapping with RSV but coming before a likely winter COVID-19 wave. Early flu vaccine data from other countries show good protection at first, around 70% in children, but that may not last.",
      "\"Total season effectiveness is probably going to actually be much, much lower,\" Chu warned, because immunity fades over time.",
      "Trevor Bedford, who also studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said H3N2 tends to evolve faster than other influenza strains.",
      "\"I expect more H3 incidence than the typical year and poorer vaccine effectiveness,\" he said. These large \"jumps\" in how the virus appears to our immune system usually occur every three to four years, he explained.",
      "Stephen Morse, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, noted that influenza's behavior still defies confident forecasting.",
      "\"Many excellent scientists have come to grief trying to predict what influenza will do \u2014 consider 1976,\" he said, referring to a year with a notorious scare over a swine flu outbreak that didn't end up spreading widely. He added that the emergence of the H3N2 K subclade was \"one of those surprises,\" and while surveillance detected it quickly, \"the bad news is that we weren't really prepared for it.\"",
      "Why that matters: H3N2 is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors. The new strain has changed in ways that make it harder for the immune system to recognize, so more people may get sick and need hospital care.",
      "The flu vaccine still helps",
      "Even with these changes, doctors say the annual flu shot is still the best protection available.",
      "\"The match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good,\" said Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. \"Even though we are expecting a H3N2 mismatch, vaccine effectiveness doesn't always correlate with vaccine match. \u2026 Bottom line, still a good idea to get the vaccine.\"",
      "Early-season data from the U.K. suggest the flu vaccine is still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children, even with the H3N2 mismatch. Protection in adults appears more modest and is expected to decline over time. Experts stress that flu vaccines are designed mainly to reduce severe disease, hospitalizations, and deaths \u2014 not necessarily to prevent every infection.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Texas Medical Branch, added that people who work with animals should also be vaccinated. \"Persons working with cattle, poultry, and pigs should receive their annual influenza vaccine,\" he said. That helps stop human viruses from mixing with animal ones and creating new strains that could be dangerous to both.",
      "Morse also underscored the value of vaccination despite the virus's unpredictability.",
      "\"I still advocate the annual influenza vaccine\u2026 It's still a good precaution,\" he said, pointing out that flu shots help protect against multiple circulating viruses, not just H3N2.",
      "Flu symptoms to watch for, and what you can do",
      "The CDC estimates there have been 4.6 million flu cases across the U.S. since this season began, and 1,900 patients have died from it, including at least three children.",
      "\"There are tons of these cases throughout the country, and it's causing a very, very severe flu,\" Kravitz said. \"Symptoms that are very intense, they come on really, really rapidly. It's very contagious, so it is spreading quickly through communities.\"",
      "Flu is often accompanied by \"high, high fevers, like 103, 104 degrees Fahrenheit,\" as well as body aches and cough, Kravitz said. In addition, she added, \"we see vomiting in children this year, specifically with this variant of the flu.\"",
      "She advised parents to help keep their child hydrated, and \"if the symptoms last a long time, more than four or five days, especially that high fever, it's a good idea to call their pediatrician.\"",
      "Experts say there's no need to panic, but it's important to prepare.",
      "\"Get your vaccine,\" Chu said. \"It's still not too late.\" The shot helps protect against severe illness and may even give \"some cross protection against H5N1 as well,\" she added.",
      "Doctors also stress the importance of early testing and treatment. Antiviral medications like Tamiflu and Xofluza still work against the flu strains circulating this season, including H3N2, but they work best when started within the first couple of days of symptoms \u2014 especially for older adults, young children, pregnant people, and those with chronic health conditions.",
      "Gray said the country needs better flu testing and more vaccines for humans and livestock.",
      "Webby summed it up simply: \"It's more of the same: vaccination, hygiene, and keeping an eye out for anything unusual.\"",
      "Bird flu still rare, but worth watching",
      "The first human case of a bird flu strain, H5N5, was recently reported in Washington state. It has not spread to others, but scientists are watching closely.",
      "\"The risk to the general public from the H5N1 virus is still very low,\" Webby said. \"But an H5 pandemic could easily make the COVID-19 pandemic look like a cake walk.\"",
      "Chu said fall bird migrations make this the time of year when cases in birds, and sometimes in people, tend to rise.",
      "\"This is the time of year when we see the H5 cases,\" she said. \"But a lot of the surveillance programs have been defunded, so in Washington state, there's not been as much as in years past.\"",
      "Morse warned that gaps in surveillance, especially in agriculture, leave room for dangerous blind spots.",
      "Surveillance is still crucial. It needs to be sustained. \u2026 Agriculture especially has to do much more,\" he said, noting that past outbreaks in pigs and cattle were missed until they were well underway.",
      "Experts say avian flu remains a low risk for most people right now, but it is a low-probability, high-impact threat that requires close monitoring.",

An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, Dec. 27 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Just after 8 a.m. on September 16, 2016, a distraught Todd Kendhammer called 911 to report a car accident on a rural road outside La Crosse, Wisconsin. \"A pipe or something came through the windshield,\" he told the operator.",
      "When authorities arrived, he told them a pipe flew off a truck driving in the opposite direction, came through the windshield and struck his wife. Barbara, 46, was rushed to the hospital but died the next day. The couple had just celebrated their 25th anniversary.",
      "Their children, Jessica Servais and Jordan Kendhammer, say their parents were still very much in love. \"Whatever my mom wanted, my dad gave it to her,\" Servais told Moriarty. \"They were just in a really good time in their lives 'cause they had their first grandchild, and they were well off.\"",
      "An autopsy revealed that Barbara died of blunt force injuries to the head and neck. She also had three lacerations to the back of her head. The medical examiner did not think Barbara's injuries were consistent with the accident as described by Todd.",
      "\"She said that the injuries to Barb were very inconsistent with a pipe \u2026 that size and that weight coming through the windshield,\" says Tim Gruenke, La Crosse County district attorney.",
      "Surveillance video from a horse ranch down the road showed what appears to be the Kendhammer car pass by at approximately 7:57 a.m. on the day of the incident. But at around the same time, no truck that matched the description Todd gave police was ever seen heading in the opposite direction.",
      "Todd Kendhammer told police that he and Barbara were driving to pick up a truck that needed a windshield replaced, belonging to a man named Justin Heim. Kendhammer did windshield replacement work as a side job.",
      "\"When the police looked into that, they found Justin Heim never had ordered a windshield from Todd, didn't need a windshield. Todd didn't even know where he lived,\" says Gruenke. Kendhammer then told police he was going to see a friend of Heim's.",
      "Gruenke believes Todd Kendhammer killed Barbara and staged the scene to look like an accident. Kendhammer was arrested three months later and went on trial a year after that. \"Every day I was in a constant state of anxiety and couldn't eat and couldn't sleep,\" says Jessica.",
      "At trial, both sides argued about what caused Barbara's injuries \u2014 a tragic accident, or a brutal fight. The windshield was as hotly disputed as the medical evidence. Dueling experts had different theories of what caused the glass fracture patterns.",
      "Jessica and Jordan don't believe prosecutors ever answered critical questions about what happened.",
      "\"They never really said how he killed her or what he did to stage everything,\" says Jessica. Her brother added, \"If he wanted to kill Ma, why the hell would he go through all the work and trouble to find a pipe, drive all the way out to the middle of a busy road\u2014.\" \"He has like 28 guns in the basement,\" Jessica interrupted. \"More than that,\" said Jordan.",
      "The prosecution had to admit they didn't know why Todd would kill Barbara. They found no evidence either one was having an affair, no history of domestic violence or financial trouble.",
      "Todd Kendhammer made the unusual decision to testify in his own defense. He told the jury he was distraught during his interview with police, when he told those different stories of where they were going that morning. \"I'm not in the right state of mind\u2026 I wasn't thinking of where I was going or what I was doing. I was thinking of Barb,\" he said on the stand.",
      "But he continued to struggle with his memory of the incident and told the jury about a third person he was going to see that morning. Gruenke asked him: \"Did you change your story for trial because you knew police had figured out your lies?\" \"No,\" he responded.",
      "Todd Kendhammer's children stood by him. \"He doesn't lie. So when he says he didn't do it, we believe him,\" Jessica said. But the jury didn't believe him, and Kendhammer was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole in 30 years.",
      "After the conviction, the Kendhammer family hired attorney Jerry Buting, of \"Making a Murderer\" fame, to handle the appeal, along with his wife and co-counsel Kathleen Stilling.",
      "\"This was an accident,\" Buting told Moriarty. \"The idea that out of the blue he would snap and kill his wife and then stage the accident, it just seems so implausible to me,\" Stilling added.",
      "In 2021, Todd Kendhammer was back in court before the same judge for an evidentiary hearing. It was a chance to argue that his original defense team had been ineffective, and that there was critical new evidence.\u00a0The forensic pathologist who testified there disagreed with the original medical examiner and said Barbara's injuries were caused by an accident.",
      "\"We aren't going to stop until he can be home,\" Jessica says.",
      "Prosecutor Gruenke believes justice has already been served for Barbara Kendhammer. \"Do you have any concerns at all that you might have convicted an innocent man?\" Moriarty asked. \"Not in this case, no,\" Gruenke replied.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: This content discusses allegations of sexual assault, which some may find distressing.",
      "Danity Kane's Aubrey O'Day is opening up about a witness affidavit that alleged she was sexually assaulted by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
      "O'Day sat down with CBS News for her first network interview since Netflix's new documentary, \"Sean Combs: The Reckoning,\" was released. A clip from the documentary shows O'Day reading from an affidavit that describes an alleged sexual assault involving her, Combs, and another man while she was \"looking very inebriated.\" She says she has no memory of the alleged incident, but it has left her with questions.",
      "O'Day left with questions after shocking affidavit",
      "\"Does this mean I was raped? Is that what this means? I don't even know if I was raped. And I don't want to know,\" said O'Day in the documentary, which has received a reported 40 million views globally in its first two weeks.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesman for Combs said that the music mogul \"categorically denies the allegations in the Netflix documentary,\" saying that \"he has never sexually assaulted anyone.\" Combs plans to address these matters \"in the appropriate legal forum\" rather than \"speculation from anonymous affidavits,\" the statement continued. Combs is currently serving a 50-month sentence in a New Jersey federal prison after being\u00a0convicted on prostitution-related charges.",
      "O'Day once worked closely with Combs, who helped found\u00a0Danity Kane\u00a0on his reality show \"Making the Band\" in 2005 before he ultimately disbanded the group in 2009. Speaking about Combs in the documentary brought up a lot of painful moments for O'Day, who said she's still processing the information.",
      "She wanted to make sure the person who wrote the affidavit is \"100 percent certain\" it was her and that they didn't confuse her with another bandmate or doppelg\u00e4nger.",
      "\"The story that they have told has been consistent for two years in every area that they've been in,\" O'Day said. To this day, O'Day still doesn't know what happened.",
      "O'Day has previously emphasized the role of forgiveness in her journey through the entertainment industry, saying that it starts with forgiving yourself.",
      "\"I forgive myself. That was the hard one,\" she said. \"The feelings that I've had throughout all of this really come down to, like, forgiving myself for misplacing abuse, or attention, or acknowledgment as love. Those weren't one in the same. And so I had to forgive myself first.\"",
      "Living her purpose",
      "When it comes to forgiving Combs, O'Day said it doesn't really matter.",
      "\"Do I forgive him? I don't think that matters to the bigger picture. I think that he needs to do the work to forgive himself,\" O'Day said.",
      "Right now, O'Day said her focus is going to remain on the survivors and pushing for systematic change.",
      "\"I want to be helping people, and speaking for the underdogs, and speaking for the voices that aren't being heard. And I didn't necessarily get to spend the majority of my life yet being able to live in my purpose,\" she said.",
      "Combs is expected to be\u00a0released from prison in May 2028, according to online prison records. While some rumors have swirled about the possibility of a presidential pardon, a senior White House official called the reports \"speculation\" and told CBS News any decisions on pardons would come directly from President Trump.",
      "Marc Agnifilo, the lead attorney for Combs,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" in August\u00a0that he hasn't had any conversations about a possible pardon: \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "O'Day doesn't believe Mr. Trump would pardon Combs.",
      "\"I think the only reason, in my opinion, that the president would pardon 'Diddy' is if it worked well for him in midterms, in regards to gathering a certain voting base,\" she said. \"The moves are always strategic, and the moves right now are about midterms.\"",

    "summary": "On Saturday, a plane landed at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport without a pilot's help.",
    "story": [
      "A plane landed at Colorado's Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport without a pilot's help on Saturday in what appears to be the first real-world use of new safety technology. According to Garmin, their emergency \"Autoland\" system was activated for the first time ever for the landing at around 2 p.m. The landing was successful and the charter company for the plane told CBS Colorado that everyone involved was okay.",
      "According to LiveATC and a pilot who heard the communication at the time, a robotic voice over air traffic control communication can be heard saying, \"Pilot incapacitation, two miles south\u2026 emergency Autoland in 19 minutes on runway 3-0.\"",
      "It came not long after taking off from Aspen's airport and pilots reported a pressurization problem while flying over the Denver metro area.",
      "\"We lost pressurization,\" the pilot told air traffic control.",
      "Cases of pilot incapacitation are rare, but nearly always fatal. The Autoland system works with the push of a button and can be activated by anyone on board the aircraft or can self-activate after a prolonged period of no pilot activity.",
      "In the air traffic control audio, the same robotic voice can also be heard describing the flight's tail number as N479BR. On Flight Aware, this tail number is shown landing at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport on Saturday afternoon, flying in from Aspen.",
      "Local flight instructor Adam Lendi was with a student when he says he heard the traffic over his radio and went out to see the plane land.",
      "\"We saw the fire trucks starting to head out,\" Lendi went on to explain, \"I was familiar with the auto land systems, and I recognized that's what was going on. So I told my student, I said, 'We might be witnessing something pretty cool here.'\"",
      "In a statement to CBS Colorado, Garmin said: \"Garmin can confirm that an emergency Autoland activation occurred at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado. The Autoland took place on Saturday, Dec. 20, resulting in a successful landing. We look forward to sharing additional details at the appropriate time.\"",
      "Flight Aware shows the operators of the plane that landed at that time as Buffalo River Aviation, who say everyone involved is okay.",
      "On Monday, the company sent CBS News Colorado a statement, saying no passengers were on board and that the pilots allowed the system to retain control of the plane, \"exercising conservative judgement.\"",
      "\"Climbing through 23,000ft MSL, the aircraft experienced a rapid, uncommanded loss of pressurization. As per standard procedures, the two pilots immediately put on their oxygen masks,\" the company's CEO Chris Townsley. \"The aircraft, equipped with Garmin Aviation's latest Emergency Descent Mode (EDM) and Autoland systems, automatically engaged exactly as designed when the cabin altitude exceeded the prescribed safe levels. The system selected a suitable airport per Garmin criteria (KBJC, Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport), navigated to it, and communicated automatically along the way.\"",
      "Townsley said that reports of the pilots being incapacitated are \"incorrect\" and were the result of the technology's automated communication and reporting functions.",
      "\"In this case, the crew consciously elected to preserve and use all available tools and minimize additional variables in an unpredictable, emergent situation, prioritizing life and a safe outcome over all other factors, as they are trained to do. The aircraft returned home the following day without incident,\" Townsley said. \"Buffalo River Aviation is grateful to the pilots for their exceptional judgment and execution of protocols, and to the Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport and Denver Center Tracon personnel for their assistance and support during this event.\"",
      "Garmin's Autoland technology for a general aviation aircraft came out in 2019, and the company says this is the first time it's ever been activated.",
      "CBS News cameras were the first to be allowed on board to see the technology in action back in 2019, as it was being approved by the FAA.",
      "Larry Anglisano, an aviation journalist for AVBrief, described Autoland as a fail-safe for when the airplane is in working order but the pilot might not be able to take control. It can even turn itself on if the pilot fails to interact with the system for a long period of time.",
      "\"This is a smart computer that's smart enough to know the pilot is incapacitated and smart enough to know where to put the airplane down for a safe landing based on the amount of runway that's needed; it'll fly around weather,\" Anglisano said.",
      "And on Saturday, the tech did just that as it brought anyone on board safely to the ground. Lendi says flights were kept out of the airspace for about an hour during this time.",
      "\"It's reassuring just to know that, if you know, as I progress in my flying career, that if I were in a situation where something happened to me, there could be an option for everybody in the plane to make it on the ground safely,\" Lendi said.",
      "On Saturday, Dec. 20 at approximately 2 p.m., North Metro Fire responded to an Alert II airplane incident at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Jefferson County with ARFF65, BC61, E61, E64, E65, E68 and M61.

    "story": [
      "Kyiv, Ukraine \u2014 Russia fired more than 650 drones and three dozen missiles at Ukraine in a large-scale attack that began during the night and stretched into daylight hours Tuesday, officials said. At least three people were killed, including a 4-year-old child, two days before Christmas.",
      "The barrage struck homes and the power grid in 13 regions of Ukraine, causing widespread outages in bitter temperatures, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, a day after he described recent progress on finding a peace deal as \"quite solid.\"",
      "The bombardment demonstrated Russian President Vladimir Putin's intention of pursuing the invasion of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Ukrainian and European officials have complained that Putin isn't sincerely engaging with U.S.-led peace efforts.",
      "The attack \"is an extremely clear signal of Russian priorities,\" Zelenskyy said. \"A strike before Christmas, when people want to be with their families, at home, in safety. A strike, in fact, in the midst of negotiations that are being conducted to end this war. Putin cannot accept the fact that we must stop killing.\"",
      "President Trump has been pressing for a peace agreement for months, but the negotiations have become entangled in the very different demands from Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday he held \"productive and constructive\" talks in Florida with Ukrainian and European representatives. Mr. Trump was less effusive Monday, saying, \"The talks are going along.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said the negotiations resulted in the preparation of \"several draft documents\" including ones on \"security guarantees for Ukraine, on recovery, and on a basic framework for ending this war. The points ... have been set in such a way as to correspond to the objective of actually ending the war and the need to prevent a third Russian invasion.\"",
      "Russian attack takes steep toll",
      "Initial reports from Ukrainian emergency services said the child died in Ukraine's northwestern Zhytomyr region, while a drone killed a woman in the Kyiv region and another civilian death was recorded in the western Khmelnytskyi region, according to Zelenskyy.",
      "Russia launched 635 drones of various types and 38 missiles, Ukraine's air force said. Air defenses stopped 587 drones and 34 missiles, it said.",
      "It was the ninth large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine's energy system this year and left multiple regions in the west without power, while emergency power outages were in place across the country, acting Energy Minister Artem Nekraso said. Work to restore power would begin as soon as the security situation permitted, he said.",
      "Ukraine's largest private energy supplier, DTEK, said the attack targeted thermal power stations in what it said was the seventh major strike on the company's facilities since October.",
      "DTEK's thermal power plants have been hit more than 220 times since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Those attacks have killed four workers and wounded 59.",
      "Authorities in the western regions of Rivne, Ternopil and Lviv, as well as the northern Sumy region, reported damage to energy infrastructure or power outages after the attack.",

      "The military has hit at least 29 alleged drug vessels since early September, killing 105 people. President Trump has argued that boat strikes have been effective at quelling drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, but critics have questioned the president's legal authority to carry out the strikes.",
      "Monday's strike targeted a vessel in international waters that was \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes,\" the U.S. Southern Command said in a post on X. The military said the boat was operated by a designated terrorist organization \u2014 it did not specify the organization, but the Trump administration has categorized several Latin American drug cartels as terror groups.",
      "The military called the target of Monday's operation a \"low-profile vessel.\" Narcotics trafficking groups have\u00a0long been accused of using submarines and semi-submersible \"low-profile\" boats to transport drugs in certain cases. In October, Mr. Trump announced a strike against an alleged drug-trafficking submarine in the Caribbean, killing two people and leaving two survivors who were repatriated to their home countries.",

      "The strikes have drawn pushback from congressional Democrats and a handful of Republicans who argue the operations haven't been authorized by Congress and the administration hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the vessels were carrying drugs.

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is still pursuing a sanctioned oil tanker in international waters, a U.S. official told CBS News on Monday, as the Trump administration appeared to intensify its targeting of oil vessels amid a pressure campaign directed at the Venezuelan government.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker, called the Bella 1, over the weekend, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official said.",
      "But the ship \u2014 which had not yet entered Venezuelan waters \u2014 refused to be boarded and sailed away, fleeing toward the Caribbean. An active pursuit began, with the vessel sending distress signals to nearby ships. That pursuit remained underway as of Monday afternoon, according to the official.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Sunday the pursuit involved \"a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion.\"",
      "\"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order,\" they said.",
      "The Coast Guard's pursuit of the tanker was first reported by Reuters. The U.S. officials who spoke with Reuters did not give a specific location for the operation or the name of the vessel being pursued.",
      "If caught and seized, it would be the third Venezuelan tanker taken by the U.S.\u00a0this month.",
      "In a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a Panama-flagged vessel called Centuries. A U.S. official told CBS News that the interdiction of the vessel followed a similar playbook to an earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela.",
      "And earlier this month, sources told CBS News the U.S. military had\u00a0seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0called The Skipper that had just left port in Venezuela.",
      "White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said on social media that the tanker seized on Saturday was \"a falsely flagged vessel operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime.\"",
      "In a statement on Saturday, the Venezuelan government condemned the vessel's seizure, saying it was a \"serious act of piracy.\"",
      "\"The colonialist model that the U.S. government seeks to impose through such practices will fail and be defeated by the Venezuelan people,\" the statement said.",
      "It added that \"these acts will not go unpunished,\" and that Venezuela \"will exercise all corresponding actions, including the complaint to the United Nations Security Council, other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world.\"",
      "President Trump last week called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela. It is part of the ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market and providing oil to countries under sanctions.",
      "\"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships,\" he added. \"There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.\"",
      "The targeting of tankers comes as Mr. Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.",

      "Banksy appeared to confirm Monday that a new mural in London, depicting two children lying down and pointing up at the sky, is his latest work.",
      "The elusive street artist posted two photos of the artwork on his official Instagram account on Monday, hours after its appearance on a wall on the side of a building in Bayswater, west London, sparked speculation over whether Banksy was behind it.",
      "The black and white mural, painted above a garage, depicts two figures dressed in winter hats and boots lying on the ground, with one of them pointing a finger upwards.",
      "An identical image appeared at the foot of a tower in central London on Monday, but the graffiti artist did not post that version on his account.",
      "Banksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His paintings and installations sell for millions of dollars at auction and have drawn thieves and vandals.",
      "While his work is often critical of government policy on migration and war, the latest artwork did not seem to carry an overt political message.",
      "In September, he made headlines with a mural showing a judge holding a gavel\u00a0looming over an unarmed protester holding a blood-splattered placard.",
      "That piece, which appeared on an external wall of a Royal Courts of Justice building, was swiftly covered up. Authorities said it had to be removed out of consideration of the building's historical significance. Banksy had posted a photo of that work \u2014captioned \"Royal Courts Of Justice. London\" \u2014 on social media, his usual method of claiming a work as authentic.",
      "Banksy also captured London's attention last summer with an animal-themed collection. And earlier last year, he unveiled a mural in London that many saw as a message on environmental conservation. The mural, in North London's Finsbury Park, appeared behind a heavily pruned tree and depicted a person seemingly spray painting green back onto the tree's limbs.",

      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 A man accused of killing 15 people at Sydney's Bondi Beach obtained firearms training in New South Wales state outside Sydney with his father, according to Australian police documents released on Monday.",
      "The documents, made public following Naveed Akram's video court appearance from a Sydney hospital where he has been treated for an abdominal injury, said the two men recorded footage justifying the meticulously planned attack.",
      "Officers wounded Akram at the scene of the Dec. 14 shooting and killed his father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram.",
      "The state government confirmed Naveed Akram was transferred Monday from a hospital to a prison. Authorities identified neither facility.",
      "The 24-year-old and his father began their attack by throwing four improvised explosive devices toward a crowd celebrating an annual Jewish event at Bondi Beach, but the devices failed to explode, the documents said.",
      "Police described the devices as three aluminum pipe bombs and a tennis ball bomb containing an explosive, gunpowder and steel ball bearings. None detonated, but police described them as \"viable\" IEDs.",
      "The pair had rented a room in the Sydney suburb of Campsie for three weeks before they left at 2:16 a.m. on the day of the attack. CCTV recorded them carrying what police allege were two shotguns, a rifle, five IEDs and two homemade ISIS flags wrapped in blankets.",
      "Police also released images of the gunmen shooting from a footbridge, providing them with an elevated vantage point and the protection of waist-high concrete walls.",
      "The largest IED was found after the gun battle near the footbridge in the trunk of the son's car, which had been left draped with the flags.",
      "Authorities had been looking into a month-long trip by the father and son to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said last week that the\u00a0attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City told CBS News the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Authorities have charged Akram with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of causing harm with intent to murder in relation to the wounded survivors and one count of committing a terrorist act.",
      "The antisemitic attack at the start of the eight-day Hanukkah celebration was Australia's worst mass shooting since a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "The New South Wales government introduced draft laws to Parliament on Monday that Premier Chris Minns said would become the toughest in Australia.",
      "The new restrictions would include making Australian citizenship a condition of qualifying for a firearms license. That would have excluded Sajid Akram, who was an Indian citizen with a permanent resident visa.",
      "Sajid Akram also legally owned six rifles and shotguns. A new legal limit for recreational shooters would be a maximum of four guns.",
      "Police said a video found on Naveed Akram's phone shows him with his father expressing \"their political and religious views and appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack.\"",
      "The men are seen in the video \"condemning the acts of Zionists\" while they also \"adhere to a religiously motivated ideology linked to (ISIS),\" police said.",

      "\"This has to be the nadir of antisemitism in our country,\" New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies President David Ossip told the crowd. \"This has to be the moment when light starts to eclipse the darkness.\"",
      "The crowd booed Albanese when Ossip acknowledged his presence. Opposition leader Sussan Ley, who had said that a conservative government led by her would reverse a decision made by Albanese's center-left Labor Party government this year to recognize a Palestinian state, was cheered.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has lashed out at Albanese over the attack on the Hannukah celebration, saying \"your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire.\" Netanyahu has repeatedly sought to link widespread calls for a Palestinian state, and criticism of Israel's military offensive in Gaza following Hamas' 2023 attack, to growing incidents of antisemitism worldwide.",
      "A national Day of Reflection to honor the victims",
      "Images of the victims, aged 10 to 87, were projected at the commemoration. \"Waltzing Matilda\" was sung in honor of the youngest victim, whose Ukrainian parents gave their Australian-born daughter what they described as the most Australian name they knew.",
      "A widely acclaimed hero of the massacre, Ahmed al Ahmed, sent a message of support from his hospital bed. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the Syrian-born immigrant was\u00a0seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker. On Tuesday, Albanese said \"Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",

      "Beyond the famous beach, people around Australia united with Sydney's stricken Jewish community by lighting candles and observing one minute of silence at their homes at 6:47 p.m. to remember the moment the massacre unfolded. Television and radio networks across Australia also fell silent.",
      "The federal and New South Wales state governments declared Sunday a national Day of Reflection to mark Australia's worst mass shooting since 35 died in Tasmania state in 1996.",
      "Albanese had earlier announced a review of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies following last week's attack, which was inspired by the Islamic State group.",
      "Indigenous leaders held a traditional smoking ceremony on Sunday morning at the waterfront Bondi Pavilion, where an impromptu memorial has grown as flowers and heartfelt messages have accumulated. The memorial is to be cleared on Monday.",

      "The Health Department said 13 of those wounded at Bondi remained in Sydney hospitals on Sunday.",
      "Police bolstered security around Bondi on Sunday, including officers armed with rifles. There was criticism that the first police responders last week were armed only with Glock pistols, which did not have the lethal range of the assailants' shotguns and rifles. Two police officers were critically wounded.",
      "Flags flew at half-staff on the Sydney Harbor Bridge and government buildings, which were lit in yellow on Sunday night in a show of solidarity with the Jewish community.",
      "Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief Alex Ryvchin said the victims' families felt \"tragically, unforgivably let down\" by government failures to combat a growth in antisemitism in Australia since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "A day after the attack, an emergency meeting of federal and state leaders committed to tightening national gun laws with measures including limiting the number of guns an individual can own. Sajid Akram legally owned six guns, including the two shotguns and two bolt-action rifles used at Bondi.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, good morning to you.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We took you literally. You said last Sunday you'd come back and talk to us about that household survey, the jobs picture. You said you really trust it. That report came out. It showed America added 64,000 jobs, with unemployment ticking up to 4.6%. But we've seen analysis, including from the top economist at us, navy, federal, saying the US is in a quote, hiring recession. Very few jobs being added since the spring, and wage gains are slowing. Are we in a hiring recession?",
      "HASSETT: No, I don't think so. I think that basically, the number was about what the market expected. It was a number that was less than 100 which is a little bit lower than you'd like. But then after that, we got the consumer price index numbers, which were really amazing. And so if you look at the three month moving average of core consumer prices, then they're running at an annual rate of about 1.6% way below the Fed's target. And my old friend, all the way back to grad school, Austin Goolsby, is now one of the Fed governors voting on interest rates, conceded that they should have cut rates faster and that he's going to do so in the future because of this inflation number.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was one of the dissenters when the Fed's decision came out. But when it comes to inflation, as you just referred to, that number showed there was still a rise in inflation, it was just at a slower pace than expected. If you pull out energy and pull out food, it rose at the slowest pace since 2021 up 2.6% in November from a year ago. But then there are quirks in here, because it looks like the prices weren't gathered until Thanksgiving discounts kicked in. There was no increase reflected in terms of housing costs. Why do you trust the data now, when you haven't in the past?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, you know, I think that you're right to always be suspicious about data, and it'll look a lot cleaner when we get a full survey, which we didn't have this time. But you know, two of the three numbers, if we go back to the three month moving average, we're fine. And so I think that the error band around the 1.6% inflation, about that's the pace it's running is probably pretty tight. Surely there will be supervisions, but I think the numbers are about right, and I usually, Margaret, don't like to go to year over year when we're talking about what's going on with inflation, because that includes a lot of high inflation Biden months in the back, and fewer and fewer as we get further into the year. But I think that the trajectory right now is best seen by the three month moving average, and that's below two, below the Fed target. So it means the Fed, as Austan Goolsbee said, has plenty of room to cut rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President said inflation has stopped. You'd acknowledge that's an exaggeration.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I guess the inflation being above the target has stopped, for sure, and so, but inflation is not zero Also, that's fair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, he did not give those caveats. He just said inflation has stopped. But Kevin, Kevin Hassett, stay with us. I've got to take a quick break, and I want to talk about the rest of what we've learned. On the other side of it. We've got more questions. Stay with us.",
      "PART 1 ENDS",
      "PART 2 STARTS",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation, and we continue our conversation now with the Director of the White House National Economic Council Kevin Hassett. This past week, we saw the President announce further changes to immigration policy. He halted diversity visas. There are now 39 countries on this travel ban or restricted list. This is in addition to all the deportations and revocations of asylum. The business community has made clear that the constant changes make it hard for them to plan, particularly in the small business category. They're concerned about a labor shortage and we've seen the U.S. workforce lose more than 1 million foreign-born workers in the past year. Are you hearing those concerns from the business community?",
      "HASSETT: Actually, it's the opposite. So in the sense that native-born workers are up more than 2 million. And so what we've seen is that as foreign-born workers, and a lot of them, don't forget, were illegal immigrants that have been deported, that when foreign-born workers depart, then it creates jobs for people who are native-born. The interesting thing too, which I'd like to remind everybody, is that native-born Americans aren't necessarily racially distinct at all.\u00a0 And so the majority of the native-born jobs that have been created over the last year are Hispanic Americans. It's, you know, just basically taking folks that are legally in the country and getting the jobs to them is what we see in the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Associated General Contractors of America didn't say they're replacing those workers easily. They're saying they're having a hard time doing that, and issued a statement saying it's a significant challenge, urging the administration to look at ways to expand the construction workforce and allow more people to lawfully enter the country.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things we're seeing, this is exactly how markets work. Right? So construction workers, their salaries this year have gone up by $3,300 on average, according to the latest report --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Because the scarcity?",
      "HASSETT: Well, but when the price goes up, then people say, oh, I should go and I used to be a construction worker, but now I'm doing something else. I should go back to construction work because the salaries are so high. And so we're seeing a lot of that go on. And so we're very bullish on construction, and really happy to see that wages are going way back up. And so instead of having, you know, basically illegal people come in and take jobs away from native-born Americans at low wages, we're seeing people reenter the labor force at high wages.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear from the business community part of the question is\u00a0 what is legal? Because you're changing the definition and pulling back asylum from some groups. So there's confusion at the constant change in policy. Will there be clarity in the new year?",
      "HASSETT: Oh, there will definitely be clarity in the new year. And I think there's clarity now that what we've done is that we've made it so that people are legally residents of the country and legally allowed to work, that they're, you know, basically top of the list when you're looking for somebody to hire.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you a bit about tariffs. Since as far back as July, we have heard the president refer to this idea of $2,000 checks being given out to households. The Treasury secretary said this would go to households making less than $100,000. Should Americans plan to receive those checks in 2026?",
      "HASSETT: That's going to depend on what happens with Congress. Congress is going to have to send those money to those peoples. But the thing we can say is that since July, we've had a lot of positive news about the economy. We've had a couple of quarters of almost 4% growth. We've got a big government surplus actually running for a few months in a row. The deficit relative to last year, is down by $600 billion and so in the summer, I wasn't so sure that there was space for a check like that, but now I'm pretty sure that there is, and so I would expect that in the new year, the President will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So a new proposal for these, it's not necessarily coming from existing tariff revenue?",
      "HASSETT: Well, it could come from from tariff revenue, but in the end, you know, we get taxes, we get tariffs, we get revenue from lots of places, and then Congress decides how to spend those monies. That's an appropriation. And so this would have to be money that would be an appropriation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So don't bank on it, in other words. So are you projecting that in the new year certain tariffs will remain in place, or do you see some of them going away?",
      "HASSETT: I think that most of the tariffs that we've passed this year have proven their mettle. We've got still high growth, which people said we couldn't if we had tariffs. We have reduction in the deficit. Reduction in the trade deficit. Imports from China are the lowest they've been since China entered the WTO. So there's a lot of success to crow about in the tariff space. But there are also things that we're hearing when we talk to people like trading partners and companies that trade a lot in the U.S.. There are also things that maybe could be adjusted. You saw that we decided to exempt coffee, for example, because we don't make a lot of coffee in the U.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And coffee prices are up.",
      "HASSETT: And I think that if there's something that's not made in the U.S. at all, that there's an appetite, and Jamieson Greer is leading the effort to study these matters, that there's an appetite to exempt things if they're really not meant to be made in the U.S. because of, you know, like climate or things like that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've also go got the Supreme Court decision pending in terms of the specific IEEPA, as they're called, these are tariffs where the justification was citing fentanyl, Canadian crude, some Chinese imports. If the Supreme Court doesn't find in your favor, who gets the refund? Is it the companies, or is it the consumers? How does that work?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, we really expect the Supreme Court is going to find with us, and I also think that if they didn't find with us, that it's going to be pretty unlikely that they're going to call for widespread refunds, because it would be an administrative problem to get those refunds out to there. But basically, whoever paid the tariff, like, actually cut the check to buy the thing, would be the person who would be getting the refund, if there were one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't the administration claim it was the country that paid that? You're saying the company.",
      "HASSETT: It would be- like, I'm not talking about the incidence, right? That like, so the incidence of the tariff. So in the end, who pays the tariff depends on elasticities of supply and demand, and we know that China cut the price a lot, so that the post tariff price from Chinese goods is about what it was before the tariff. But the people who pay the tariff, if there is a refund, the people who actually paid for the good, the importer, in most cases, they're the ones who would be the first line of defense for refunding the tariff. But I really, really don't think that's going to happen, it'd be very complicated. And then that person would be responsible for allocating the tariff refund to the appropriate folks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a mess.",
      "HASSETT: Yes, it is a mess, and that's why I think the Supreme Court wouldn't do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll wait and see. I want to quickly ask you about the oil market. I asked you last Sunday about that decision to seize a tanker off the coast of Venezuela. We saw yet another one over the weekend. You said last Sunday, it probably won't affect oil prices to be taking this oil off the black market. Do you stand by that? And was all that oil going to China?",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, you know, I haven't been briefed on the latest. I did see that this is another ship that was basically operating in the black market. And so there have been a little bit, there's been a little bit of black market activity in the oil sector to go to sanctioned countries and to get them some oil. And they're getting that oil in order to avoid the reforms that we think would make countries a better place. And so it's not a lot of oil compared to world supply. And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the U.S. that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships. There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were these sanctioned ships going to China?",
      "HASSETT: I'm not sure where they were going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Kevin Hassett, thank you for your time--",
      "HASSETT: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have a great holiday. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Paul S. Coakley, President of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Oklahoma City Archbishop, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Father, I want to ask you about this role you have at the head of the conference of bishops. Last month, there was this urgent message. It was a very rare statement addressing concern for the evolving situation impacting migrants, and the language was pretty sharp in it. Quote, \"We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people. We pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence, whether directed at immigrants or at law enforcement.\" What are bishops that you talk to seeing in parishes all around the country? What triggered this?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I think it varies from place to place, for sure. So in communities with a more dense migrant population, there is a great deal of fear and uncertainty, anxiety because of the level of rhetoric that is- that is often employed when addressing issues around migration and the threats of deportation. So there's a lot of anxiety, so our pastors are trying to accompany people, walk with people, reassure people, and that's the message of the Church. And that was the reason for our special message in November, that we're with you. We hear you, we're aware of your suffering or your fears, and we fully intend to accompany you during this difficult time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I know there have been bishops in places like Charlotte, in parts of California, who have formally granted permission, or dispensation is the word used, for people to skip Sunday mass if they're afraid they could be targeted by ICE. Are you actually seeing a decline in the number of people attending mass because they're afraid they'll be arrested?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: We're not seeing that here in in Oklahoma. And I haven't heard it reported widely from my brother bishops. So I know that that is the case in some, some places, but I don't think it's as common, at least here locally or in places that I have personal contact with. There's a- there's an anxiety, there's a fear, but I don't think it's kept people away in great numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this video that you released really got a lot of attention. It certainly got ours, and it mentioned being troubled by threats against the sanctity of houses of worship as well as hospitals and schools. You know, I spoke to the Vice President JD Vance last year and asked him about this change in policy that would allow for ICE to enter churches and schools. And he really pushed back hard. He says that the Catholic Church receives funds to help resettle immigrants. Thus they are motivated by financial and not humanitarian reasons. Have you had any kind of conversation with the Trump administration, with the Vice President to explain what it is you're trying to say?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I have not had any personal conversations at this point with either the president or the vice president, so I look forward to engaging with them over matters of mutual concern, and certainly, undoubtedly the question of immigration is going to come up. I think we have opportunities to work together. We have opportunities to speak frankly with one another, so I will look forward to that in the near future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the Vice President calls himself a devout Catholic, which is also why I ask. I mean, do you- what do you say to Catholics like him who argue that these hard line immigration policies have had a result that they sought, that the end justifies the means.",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: I don't think we can ever say that the end justifies the means. We have to treat everyone with respect, respect of the human dignity, dignity of every person. There is no conflict necessarily between advocating for safe and secure borders and treating people with respect and dignity. We always have to treat people with, with dignity, God-given dignity. The state doesn't award it, and the state can't take it away. So it's, it's from the Creator. So I think as Christians, as believers, we- that's kind of a foundational bedrock thing for us, that people are to be respected and treated with dignity, whether they are documented or undocumented, whether they are here legally or illegally, they don't forfeit their human dignity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what is it that you think is causing that to be an issue right now? Why do you think that there is a loss of dignity? Are there specific policies that you are thinking of when you say that?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, not necessarily. I mean, I- just to treat people with respect, to afford them due process. The deportations that are, that are happening around the country can- it's instilling, as I said, fear in a rather widespread manner. So I think that's, that's something that concerns us all, that people have a- have a right to live in, in security and without fear of random and deportations. I think we're believers, of course, in due process. We have provisions in law that award due process to, to everyone. So that's what we are wanting to emphasize.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would you advise others, other people of faith, to do for these immigrants?",
      "ARCHBISHOP PAUL COAKLEY: Well, we are a nation of immigrants ourselves. So I think that's something that we as Americans need to always come back to. We are founded upon the immigrant experience. So I think we need to be generous in welcoming immigrants. We certainly have a right and a duty to respect borders of our nation. And I would say, remind all of us that we have a right and a duty to respect sovereign borders of a state, but, but we also have a responsibility to welcome migrants. This is kind of a fundamental principle in, in Catholic social teaching regarding immigration and migration. People have a right to to remain in their homeland, but, but they also ought to be allowed to migrate when conditions in their homeland are unsafe and necessitate moving to a place where they can find peace and security.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: UNICEF warns that more than 200 million children will require humanitarian assistance in the coming year. The largest crisis right now is Sudan. Catherine Russell, UNICEF's Executive Director is just back from Sudan and South Sudan. Good morning to you.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Good morning, Margaret, how are you?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well, but you are- we want to draw attention here to those in need. And I know Secretary of State Marco Rubio, just on Friday, called for a cessation of hostilities. He said the U.S. is pushing for humanitarian truce to allow some of these aid organizations to operate. But aid convoys have been struck on their way in, he also acknowledged. What kind of challenges are you facing?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, Sudan is, at this moment, the largest humanitarian crisis we're facing. And there are many things happening there. One is that children, in particular, but people are on the move. Millions of people are moving around the country. We have hunger, extreme hunger, including famine designated in certain parts of the country. We're also seeing just horrific levels of violence- excuse me, including rape, including against children. UNICEF did a report about that about a year ago, even children under the age of one. Absolutely terrible stories. And a woman I met in Chad who had fled Darfur told me about the effort to sort of rape women in front of their families and their communities, really trying to terrorize them and videotaping it to humiliate them. And so the levels of violence are horrific. We have children out of school. So the bottom line here is that the needs are enormous. The challenges are just absolutely staggering. And I think the world needs to come together. You know, in the short term, for sure, we need better humanitarian access. We need to reach all of these communities, \u00a0that's hard to do right now. But the truth is Margaret that what I heard from children across Sudan was the same thing, which is, I would say to them, you know, what do you think about? What do you want? And they all said the same thing, which is, we want peace. I think they understand that the only answer here, really, is to solve the political problems so that people can get back to some sort of a decent life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just, I don't want to let go what you just mentioned, in terms of why something like that would be done to children and to women in front of their families. The term genocide is used in Sudan. What you are describing there in terms of treatment of gender based violence, it sounds like you are saying that is an attempt to destroy a society by carrying out rape.",
      "RUSSELL: I mean, there are definitely atrocities that are intended to terrorize communities, to force them to move, to scare them. And you know, they're effective strategies for sure. And I think you know the world needs to take a look. I mean, Sudan, I know it seems so far away, and it is in many ways, but it is also a place where children are suffering so enormously. And I think especially, you know, now we're in the holiday season, you know, you want to think about, you know, people being with their families all the rest of it. I mean, children in so many places are not- are not having those sort of luxuries. They are really suffering. And I think the world needs to pay attention to that. And I commend, you know, Senator Rubio- Secretary Rubio, now for pointing this out, because I think the key thing here is that we need attention to the problem.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the U.S. has historically been the largest donor to UNICEF, but we've seen tremendous cuts by this administration, including a $142 million claw back of congressionally approved funds. Secretary Rubio said no one died from these aid cuts, and on Friday, he said he's very proud of the changes that were made in foreign aid. Tell us what the reality is of the funding cuts.",
      "RUSSELL: The funding cuts are challenging. And I think the issue to understand is it's not just the United States. It's almost every donor to- certainly to UNICEF, but to the UN system broadly, and to the humanitarian sector. And so when you add all of those together, the impacts are really dramatic, because it means that you know what- what financial support we do get, we have to spread now over- over more places, and with less support from- from donor countries. So I think you know there are, certainly, you know, there have been and will probably always be catastrophes that we're trying to deal with, and children are suffering. The United States has always proudly led, I think, on humanitarian response and on helping children. And, you know, we're hopeful that some of the money that has been taken back will be restored to us. We continue to work with the State Department. There are efforts to fund a lot of the humanitarian and sort of life saving work that we do. But really, you know, the needs around the world are just absolutely enormous, and it's the United States and other donors who have to come in behind that, along with the private sector, I have to add that that is also important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I should point out that the U.S. is one of the largest foreign aid donors to South Sudan, but that foreign aid is also under threat at this moment because of the government not complying with what the U.S. is demanding. Let me quickly--",
      "RUSSELL: --South Sudan is a challenge. I was just there too, and that is, you know, the government there needs to do a better job",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly before I let you go. Gaza, how are things improving?",
      "RUSSELL: Well, again, I would say, thanks to the ceasefire and the administration here was critical on doing that, things have gotten a bit better. We are able to move around better. But, you know, there's tremendous misery. The challenges remain. We have a lot of work that needs to get done. I mean, you've seen all of the images, the destruction. You know, we still have serious level- levels of malnutrition. We are trying to get shelter in place. You know, there's rain and just misery for children all around. So I think, you know, I would say there definitely is progress with the ceasefire. God willing that holds, and then we can continue to get more and more aid in there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: God willing that holds, as you say. Catherine Russell, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.",

    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel \u2014 especially under foot \u2014 and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen \u2014 a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled \u2014 a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-sourced sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

      "She returned to the show two more times before upsetting Carson and effectively getting banned for the rest of his tenure as host. According to the show's publicist, Charlie Barrett, Carson told DeGeneres not to make a certain joke during her third appearance in May 1987, but the comedian chose to do so anyway.",
      "\"Barrett was there in the green room after the show when Jim [McCawley] chastised Ellen in front of everyone,\" Malkoff wrote. \"Pointing at her, he said, 'I told you not to do that material.' Barrett recalled Ellen looking embarrassed. Jim made Ellen and her guest leave, saying, 'You won\u2019t be back again too soon.'\"",

      "The \"Star Trek\" actor was unaware of the unwritten rules for guests appearing on the talk show and accidentally broke three. According to the book, Shatner made the mistake of speaking \"monotonously for four minutes straight,\" without letting Carson interject.",
      "\"Second, he turned his back on his host to talk to Buddy Hackett,\" the book states. \"Third, he disregarded the Tonight rule that it was okay to mention your non-NBC TV series but not the network it aired on. Shatner mentioned the show, his series T. J. Hooker, and then also mentioned that it was on ABC. (The word was muted for air.)\"",
      "While Shatner would come back to the show as a guest, it was only with guest hosts, including Jay Leno and Patrick Duffy. Shatner evidently didn't understand why he wasn't asked back, as, according to the book, he later told USA Today that Carson \"would get a hate-on for people\" and decide they would not come back to the show.",

      "That all changed in January 1986, when Sagan corrected Carson twice as the two were discussing Halley's comet.",
      "\"Carson made light of his mistakes. He hid his embarrassment with his affable smile,\" Malkoff wrote. \"Inside, though, he felt slighted. Strange that such a brief exchange carried such a sting, but despite his abiding respect for Sagan, Carson made sure the astrophysicist was not invited back to the talk show that had brought him enviable celebrity status.\"",

      "The comedian had been playing Carson in similar sketches since the late 1980s. Jeff Sotzing, a producer on the \"Tonight Show,\" told Malkoff in the book that Carson wasn't a fan, saying, \"I don\u2019t talk like that. I don\u2019t use those expressions,\" with Sotzing adding he thought they made him \"seem like he was old and confused.\"",
      "Despite his dislike of the sketches, Carson continued to have Carvey on the show until a 1990 sketch that portrayed Carson as \"out of touch, unhip and clueless\" while chatting with his guest and competitor Arsenio Hall.",
      "\"After that, Carvey was permanently banned from Tonight,\" the book says. \"Days after the airing of the offending sketch about him and Ed, during his monologue, Johnny referenced it without mentioning the show.

      "Things changed when Welles told Carson that he would be doing a mentalist routine while guest-hosting the show for the fifth time. While Carson was skeptical, he watched as Welles' trick failed, later finding out that the director had hired two men to sit in the audience to help him. The two messed up, leading to Welles' failure.",
      "\"He wasn\u2019t irate because the trick flopped; he was furious that Orson was dishonest,\" Malkoff wrote. \"A magician using audience plants was inexcusable. The towering figure of world cinema and part-time magician never again appeared as a guest with Carson hosting.\"",

      "After Lewis guest hosted for a week, Malkoff writes that the show's cue card guy, Don Schiff, told Carson he would never be in charge of cards when Lewis was guest hosting. When pressed for a reason, Schiff told Carson, Lewis \"got hysterical [and] verbally abusive\" when Schiff told him he couldn't fulfill his request in time.",
      "\"After hearing the story, Johnny made a quick decision,\" the book says. \"Despite Lewis\u2019s being a giant of American entertainment, Johnny was clear: Lewis would never guest-host or appear on the show again. And other than one brief exception, he never did.\"",

      "Things soured between the two of them in October 1982, the final time Allen guest hosted. Malkoff writes that one of the reasons Allen was banned was because he mocked a previous injury suffered by Carson. In addition, word got back to Carson that Allen was rude to crew members for making changes his associates requested.",
      "Infuriated at the changes his own people had requested, Steve phoned the crew member the next day, yelling at them. Word got back to Johnny. The crew member asked never to work with Allen again. Johnny assured him that he wouldn\u2019t have to, because Allen had been banned.",

    "summary": "Legal expert breaks down Nick Reiner&apos;s challenging road ahead in the murder case, from competency evaluations to potential death penalty decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Murphy told Fox News Digital that the case against Nick Reiner is still in the discovery phase.",
      "Attorney Matt Murphy\u00a0is sharing insight into what the road ahead looks like for Nick Reiner after he was taken into custody for allegedly murdering his parents, beloved Hollywood actor and director Rob Reiner, and his wife, Michele Reiner.",
      "When speaking with Fox News Digital, Murphy explained that discovery is still ongoing in this case, saying Nick's lawyer, Alan Jackson, \"needs to carefully review as much discoveries as he can get,\" so that he can \"confidently decide\" if his client should \"just plead not guilty\" or to submit a \"guilty by reason of insanity plea.\"",
      "\"So continuing an arraignment, there's nothing unusual about that. And it's also important to remember that Nick Reiner not being transported \u2013 there's no verdict on that. There's no mental health professional that is making that call. The defense has the unilateral ability to, like I said, declare a doubt. And they can say, 'My client isn't ready to do this yet,' and at this stage, the court basically has to take them at their word.\"",
      "Murphy says Jackson now has to \"get his clients stabilized [and] communicative,\" adding that the next step in the process is to \"hurry up and wait.\" He added that he \"wouldn't be surprised to see this arraignment continued\" a few times, until Jackson \"decides whether or not he's going to enter a plea.\"",
      "Murphy says the case is still in the discovery phase. (Laura Cavanaugh/FilmMagic)",
      "ROB REINER AND WIFE MURDERED: TIMELINE SHOWS ARGUMENT WITH SON NIGHT BEFORE DEATHS",
      "He explained that the defense will likely ask the court for time to evaluate everything, and knowing that this case has the potential for the death penalty, Murphy emphasized that he wouldn't \"want the public's desire for an outcome ever to influence the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant\" and therefore would support that.",
      "\"The defense will then prepare what's known as a live-z packet, or in Los Angeles County, they call it a live z hearing. He's gonna accumulate as much information as he can regarding factors in mitigation,\" he explained. \"In the death penalty analysis, it's about factors in aggravation versus factors in mitigation. And some big factors in mitigation Alan Jackson's gonna argue are, the history of substance abuse, the family dynamics, the fact that these weren't strangers, these were his parents that knew him, et cetera, et cetera et cetera.\"",

      "Jackson will then present the packet to Los Angeles County District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, and his staff.",
      "LEGENDARY DELI MADE FAMOUS BY ROB REINER'S MOST ICONIC MOVIE SCENE",
      "\"Nathan Hockman will then make a decision regarding whether they're gonna seek the death penalty or whether they are simply gonna seek life without possibility of parole,\" Murphy said. \"And again, my prediction is they're going to seek LWOP. They're gonna to seek life without possibility parole. But I could be surprised. I've been wrong before.\"",
      "Murphy predicts Nick will receive a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. (\u00a0Rommel Demano/Getty Images)",
      "After Nick was detained under suspicion of murdering his parents, his history with addiction and mental health struggles have resurfaced.",
      "Murphy predicts Jackson will come in with \"some sort of mental health defense based on the addiction,\" and his struggles with mental health issues, but said there is a difference as far as \"organic mental illness\" goes. Organic mental illness encompasses illnesses such as \"schizophrenia that develops, that is no fault of the defendant.\"",
      "NICK REINER WILL BE CHARGED IN ROB REINER, MICHELE REINER'S DEATHS",
      "\"In other words, they get sick, they get mentally ill, and then they try to self-medicate, or they get into drugs as a result of that,\" Murphy said. \"I haven't heard any of that yet on Nick Reiner.\"",
      "He went on to compare Nick's case to another he worked in Orange County, California, which involved a young man with documented organic mental illness, who murdered his parents and was deemed legally sane and found guilty.",
      "Murphy compared Nick's case to a similar case he worked in Orange County. (Mona Edwards)",
      "\"California uses what's known as The McNaughton Rule,\" Murphy said. \"The McNaughton Rule is about 150 years old, and it basically stands for the proposition that if the criminal defendant understands the nature and quality of their acts, the nature and the quality of the acts at the time they commit the murder, then they are legally responsible even if they're high, even if their drunk, even they're suffering from mental illness.\"",

      "ROB REINER AND WIFE MICHELE WERE FOUND DEAD IN THEIR BEDROOM: LAPD",
      "\"So the way we would explain it to our juries is if the devil pops up on the guy's shoulder and says 'hey go over there and stab that banana,' the person does not understand that they're killing a human being,\" he continued. \"In other words, they don't understand the nature and quality of their acts. However, if it's the devil pops up on your shoulder and says, go kill those people or I'm going to turn you into a frog, you still under the law have a moral and legal responsibility to tell the devil no.\"",
      "WATCH: ATTORNEY MATT MURPHY SAYS IT WOULDN'T SHOCK HIM TO SEE \u2018A BATTLE OF THE EXPERTS\u2019 DURING THE NICK REINER TRIAL",
      "Due to these factors, Murphy said that \"as good as Alan Jackson is, he's up against a tough one,\" adding that being intoxicated is not a \"true defense to murder,\" because if it was, \"nobody would ever be held accountable for murder.\"",
      "In terms of the actual trial, Murphy says that it's possible that the defense will \"declare a doubt regarding the mental competency\" of their client, after which \"the court will appoint two experts to do an evaluation,\" and then \"you wind up with this very long procedural process.\"",

      "Murphy predicts the defense will \"declare a doubt\" about Nick's mental competency. (Michael Buckner/Getty Images for Teen Vogue)",
      "\"Doctors will evaluate Nick Reiner and render their opinions,\" he said. \"And then if he's found to be incompetent, then he goes to a mental health facility. It's locked down for treatment and medication so that he will come back. And sometimes you see, it's almost like a game, a ping pong, where the mental health professionals will certify somebody for competency, send them back to court, and then the defense lawyer will declare a doubt again.\"",
      "Murphy made it clear that the investigation doesn't stop when charges are filed and that both the defense and the prosecution will conduct \"a very dedicated [and a] very professional investigation.\"",
      "WATCH: ATTORNEY MATT MURPHY PREDICTS NICK REINER'S TRIAL \u2018IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG PROCESS\u2019",
      "A video of Nick walking into a gas station and buying a drink following the murder has since surfaced online, and he allegedly was \"acting bizarrely\" prior to the murders while at Conan O'Brien's holiday party, two things Murphy says \"can cut both ways.\"",
      "\"With a very skilled trial lawyer like Alan Jackson, he's going to argue, 'Look, that means he doesn't know that he did anything wrong,'\" Murphy explained. \"And what the prosecution is going to say is. 'Look, that guy, clearly, he's not howling at the moon. He knows how to use a credit card. He knows that he's dealing with a person behind the register.' And truly, under the law, it's a very, very strict standard under the McNaughton rule.\"",

      "Murphy ended by acknowledging that \"addiction hits almost every family in America,\" and that so many people know someone like Nick, adding about Nick that \"I think it's very clear that he was loved by his parents.\"",
      "\"The number we keep seeing is 17 stints in rehab. I mean, that's two parents that really love their son,\" Murphy said. \"Even to the point that he's 32 years old and they're bringing him to Conan O'Brien's party. So he had a lot of advantages in life, and he's previously described himself as being a spoiled rich kid. So we'll see where this goes. This is gonna be a very, very interesting case to watch.\"",

      "POPULAR SLEEP POSITIONS COULD BE DAMAGING YOUR NERVES, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "When acid reflux becomes dangerous",
      "\"Your stomach is designed to handle acid. Your esophagus is not,\" Dr. Daryl Gioffre, a Florida-based gut health specialist and certified nutritionist, told Fox News Digital.",
      "About 10% of people with chronic acid reflux will develop Barrett\u2019s esophagus, a condition where the lining of the lower esophagus is replaced with abnormal cells that are more prone to cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "In most people, the lower esophageal sphincter \u2014 which Gioffre refers to as the \"acid gate\" \u2014 keeps acid in the stomach, which is lined with thick mucus and specialized cells designed to protect it.",
      "\"With reflux, the danger is not the burn in the chest or throat \u2014 the real danger is the constant backflow of acid traveling the wrong way.\"",
      "\"But when the gate gets weak, it relaxes or stays slightly open, and acid slips back up the wrong way,\" he said. This \"gate\" can weaken with magnesium deficiency, high stress, alcohol, poor sleep, dehydration and late-night snacking, all of which can disrupt healthy digestion.",
      "When acid hits the esophagus, it irritates tissue that was never designed to withstand it, according to the doctor.",
      "\"Every time acid comes back up the wrong way, it injures the lining like a slow chemical burn,\" said Gioffre, who is also the author of \"Get Off Your Acid\" and \"Get Off Your Sugar.\" Over time, that irritation erodes the lining, drives inflammation and can change the cells.",
      "NOT ALL FIBER IS CREATED EQUAL \u2014 DOCTORS SHARE WHICH KINDS TRULY SUPPORT LONGEVITY",
      "\"These new cells are no longer normal esophageal cells \u2014 they begin to shift into cells that look more like stomach lining, because those cells can tolerate the acid,\" the doctor said. \"That change is called metaplasia, or Barrett\u2019s esophagus.\"",
      "Once the cells start changing, the risk of further mutation goes up. If that process continues, Gioffre warned, it can progress to dysplasia, which is the stage right before esophageal cancer.",
      "Some studies have shown that among those with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, between 3% and 13% will go on to develop cancer. (iStock)",
      "\"So the real danger is not the heartburn you feel,\" he summarized. \"It is the repeated acid exposure forcing the esophagus to adapt in ways it was never designed to. Fixing reflux at the root stops this entire cascade before those cellular changes begin.\"",
      "Men at higher risk",
      "Men generally have a higher risk because they burn through magnesium faster, tend to carry more visceral fat pushing upward on the stomach, eat heavier meals and snack late at night, Gioffre cautioned. These activities all weaken the acid gate and shut down healthy digestion.",
      "THE BREAD THAT KEEPS THINGS MOVING IN THE BATHROOM \u2014 AND DOCTORS SAY IT REALLY WORKS",
      "\"Eating within three hours of lying down almost guarantees the stomach does not empty, and that is one of the biggest drivers of nighttime reflux,\" he said. \"On top of that, men often ignore symptoms, or mask them with PPIs and antacids instead of fixing the root cause.\"",
      "All of these factors contribute to a \"perfect storm\" for chronic inflammation and long-term damage, according to Gioffre.",

      "There are certain red flags that indicate when acid reflux has gone beyond an occasional annoyance and has progressed to constant and chronic.",
      "\"If that burn becomes more frequent or more intense, or starts showing up even when you have not eaten, your body is waving a giant warning flag,\" Gioffre said.",
      "Difficulty swallowing, a feeling that food is \"stuck,\" chronic hoarseness, a constant cough, throat clearing or the feeling of a lump in the throat are all indicators that the acid is moving upward into areas it should never reach. (iStock)",

    "summary": "From a diaper bank in South Carolina to a community clinic in Florida and a village in India, pregnant women are getting a healthier start thanks to free prenatal multivitamins from Vitamin Angels and its partners. Their stories reveal how targeted nutrition support can help moms carry to term and give babies a stronger beginning.",
    "story": [
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "While everyone\u2019s experiences and needs are different, and prenatals should be taken as a part of a healthcare provider\u2019s recommended prenatal care plan, Ty\u2019hara valued the healthy foundation they delivered during her pregnancy. The vitamins help the baby\u2019s organs \"function and form correctly,\" she said, \"as well as\u2026helping me with my iron and minerals and all the things that I need to support successful growth for her.\"",
      "Across the globe in India, a mom-to-be named Santoshini took Vitamin Angels supplements to round out her healthy routine. Like many of her neighbors, she got the vitamins free of charge from a program partner that collaborates with the Indian government to offer health education, childcare, immunizations, and more. \"I feel like these supplements help me get through the day without feeling tired,\" Santoshini said. That\u2019s important because, while she was pregnant, she also cared for her active\u00a0two-year-old son.",
      "Indeed, Vitamin Angels\u2019 impact goes far beyond underserved communities in the US to reach more than 74 million women and children annually in 65 countries worldwide. In low-resource areas, problems from insufficient nutrition from pregnancy until a child\u2019s fifth birthday can include additional and irreversible complications like blindness.",
      "But both at home and away, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a big difference. Case in point: A single dollar donation can impact four children;\u00a0$5 dollars reaches 20.",
      "\"Supporting moms during pregnancy is one of the smartest investments you can make,\"\u00a0Scott Minger, Vitamin Angels Chief Development Officer, said. \"For the cost of a few cups of coffee, we can provide a woman with a full course of prenatal multivitamins that help her stay healthy, carry to term, and welcome a stronger, healthier baby.\"",
      "Prevagen\u2019s leadership agrees the investment is well worth it, said Tom Dvorak, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Quincy Bioscience. \"At Prevagen, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Vitamin Angels allows us to transform that belief into meaningful action by supporting mothers and children with the essential nutrition they need to thrive.\"",

      "The scientists, led by Dr. Indraneel Mittra, a researcher and professor at ACTREC, conducted the study in 20 glioblastoma patients who were already scheduled for brain surgery, according to the study, which was published in the journal BJC Reports in September.",

      "The researchers observed major biological changes in the treated tumors, including the near-complete removal of DNA fragments that trigger inflammation and sharp reductions in several markers of tumor aggressiveness.",
      "Tumor growth activity fell by about 33%, cancer biomarkers dropped by 57%, immune-checkpoint signals fell by 41% and stem-cell markers were reduced by 56%, with no side effects reported, according to a study press release.",
      "Researchers say a simple supplement combination triggered dramatic biological changes in glioblastoma tumors. (iStock)",
      "\"These results suggest that a simple, inexpensive and non-toxic nutraceutical tablet potentially has the power to heal glioblastoma,\" Mittra said in a statement.",
      "Ten of the patients were given a tablet containing resveratrol and copper four times a day for roughly 12 days before their operation, while the other 10 received no supplements and served as controls. During surgery, doctors collected tumor tissue from all participants, allowing them to compare treated and untreated tumors.",

      "The samples were analyzed to measure tumor growth, inflammation, immune activity, cancer stem-cell markers and the presence of cell-free chromatin particles, which are DNA fragments released by dying cancer cells that can worsen tumor behavior.",
      "\"We observed near-complete eradication of cell-free chromatin particles from the cancerous glioblastoma tissues following [the resveratrol and copper] treatment,\" Mittra told Fox News Digital. \"This finding was particularly significant because cell-free chromatin particles are key drivers of tumor aggressiveness.\"",

      "The White House told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration plans to keep working \"day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",
      "\"The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters. He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement. \"Nothing in today\u2019s ruling detracts from that core agenda.\"",
      "In a statement, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul praised the court's decision.",
      "\"Nearly 250 years ago, the framers of our nation\u2019s Constitution carefully divided responsibility over the country\u2019s militia, today\u2019s U.S. National Guard, between the federal government and the states \u2013 believing it impossible that a president would use one state\u2019s militia against another state,\" he said. \"The extremely limited circumstances under which the federal government can call up the militia over a state's objection do not exist in Illinois, and I am pleased that the streets of Illinois will remain free of armed National Guard members as our litigation continues in the courts.\"",
      "The update comes after the Trump administration asked the high court last week to stay a lower court order blocking Trump from immediately deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago.",
      "\"This decision reinforces that domestic deployment of troops is rare and exceptional, and it was absolutely unjustified in Illinois,\" said Hina Shamsi, director of ACLU\u2019s National Security Project. \"With each court decision against the President\u2019s domestic troop deployments, it becomes clearer that his version of American cities as hellscapes, and protest against his policies as requiring troops, is plain false. We\u2019re glad that the Supreme Court has upheld the order blocking this blatant abuse of presidential power because there\u2019s no reason for any troops policing civilians in our streets.\"",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the administration's appeal to the Supreme Court that a federal judge's earlier order, as well as the partial stay granted by a unanimous 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, \"improperly impinges on the president\u2019s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property.\"",
      "Blocking the deployment of National Guard troops, Sauer argued, risks \"jeopardizing the lives and safety of DHS officers,\" and prevents officials from taking what he argued are \"reasonable and lawful measures\" to protect federal agents from the \"violent resistance\" that they argue has persisted in Chicago.",

      "Boca Raton, Florida's Republican Mayor Scott Singer announced a run for Congress last week and spoke to Fox News Digital about his case to voters that Washington needs more local, common-sense leadership and fewer policies that he says have fueled inflation, weakened border security and slowed economic growth.",
      "Singer announced his run against Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz in Florida's 23rd Congressional District with a launch video referencing New York City's onerous taxes and referencing Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's \"radical left policies\" while contrasting the economic and tax landscape with Florida, where many New Yorkers have fled to in recent years.",
      "\"I love public service,\" Singer told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s been the honor of my life to serve as mayor. We have an opportunity to keep America going in the right direction and reverse some of the policies from the past four years that led to porous borders, high taxes, higher inflation and have hurt our economy.\"",

      "The mayor drew a sharp contrast with today\u2019s Democratic Party, arguing it has moved too far to the left to deliver practical solutions.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the Democratic Party of today is not our parents\u2019 Democratic Party,\" Singer said. \"With an increasingly out-of-touch, far-left progressive party, it\u2019s hard for common-sense solutions to come out of that.\"",
      "Singer said his experience in local government has shown him what effective governance looks like \u2014 and what Washington is missing.",
      "\"At the local level, we\u2019ve excelled because we have to,\" Singer said. \"We have balanced budgets. We can\u2019t shut down the government. We have to pick up the trash every day and deliver essential services. And we do that by finding common ground.\"",

      "That approach, Singer argued, is increasingly absent in Congress, where partisan gridlock often stalls progress.",
      "He also voiced strong support for President Donald Trump\u2019s policy agenda, particularly efforts to combat antisemitism on college campuses, reduce the size of government and roll back federal regulations.",
      "\"Our campuses have been unsafe for years,\" Singer said. \"President Trump has stood up to antisemitism by holding universities accountable. We need to codify those gains, not just rely on executive orders.\"",
      "Singer pledged he would also push to restore more authority to states and local governments, particularly on education and environmental policy, and continue efforts to rein in federal spending.",
      "\"Harmful regulation has killed jobs and increased costs,\" he said. \"We need long-term solutions that put power back in the hands of states and communities, not Washington bureaucrats.\"",

      "Earlier this year, shortly before Mamdani's victory, Singer told Fox News Digital that the socialist candidate's rise in New York City is likely to spark an exodus of businesses to Florida, a move he said he has already started to see in his conversations with business owners.",

      "Singer continued, \"I think one year out, you're going to see a substantial exodus of companies that are able to move. Two years out, we're going to see depressed values, more unemployment, higher crime. And four years out? We don't know. I think at that point, they'll be ready for a new mayor if what we expect to happen in November happens.\"",

      "The update comes after the court's inquiry had been stalled for months, both by appeals court rulings, efforts to shield certain information from the court for national security purposes, and a separate, but related, contempt inquiry.",
      "The CECOT migrants were again moved in July from the Salvadoran prison to Venezuela as part of a broader prisoner exchange that involved the return of at least 10 Americans detained in Venezuela.

    "story": [
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, fired back in an interview with Fox News Digital after Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, jumped into the 2026 Democratic primary for his Senate seat.",
      "Republican Sen. John Cornyn says that Rep. Jasmine Crockett's campaign launch in Texas' high-stakes 2026 Senate race is proof that \"the Democratic Party has become the captive of the left wing.\"",
      "Cornyn, the longtime senator from Texas who's facing arguably the toughest re-election of his political career, charged in a Fox News Digital interview that the bid by Crockett, a progressive champion and vocal critic and foil of President Donald Trump, shows that \"even people like Chuck Schumer,\" the top Democrat in the Senate, \"have been hijacked by the Bernie Sanders and AOC wing of the Democratic Party.\"",
      "Crockett, a two-term lawmaker who represents a Dallas-area district, launched her bid earlier this month hours after former Rep. Colin Allred, a more moderate Democrat running a second straight time for the Senate in right-leaning Texas, ended his campaign.",
      "Crockett will now face off in her party's March 3 primary with state Rep. James Talarico, a former middle school teacher and Presbyterian seminarian who is also seen as a rising Democrat. The general election showdown in Texas is one of a handful of midterm races that may determine if the GOP holds its Senate majority.",

      "Cornyn embraces Crockett's entry into the race.",
      "\"I think she is unelectable in a general election in Texas. Texas is still a conservative red state,\" Cornyn claimed. \"She can't win, so I'm really happy she's decided to run.\"",
      "While Crockett and Talarico face off for the Democratic nomination, Cornyn is battling Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt in a competitive and combustible Republican primary.",
      "THE GOP'S TAKE ON HIGH-PROFILE SENATE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES: 'THEY'RE IN SHAMBLES'",
      "And unlike the Democratic primary, where Crockett and Talarico are the only major candidates, the three-way Republican race may be headed towards a May runoff, which would be triggered if no candidate tops 50% in the March primary.",
      "But Cornyn said that a GOP runoff won't \"really change our chances of winning in November.\"",
      "Cornyn is backed by Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) in the GOP primary.",
      "NRSC chair Sen. Tim Scott predicts Cornyn will be the GOP's nominee, emphasizing in a Fox News Digital interview last week that \"we are confident that Texas will be red, ruby red, with John Cornyn as our candidate.\"",
      "Paxton, who has been battered over the past decade by a slew of scandals and legal problems and who is now dealing with a messy divorce, is a longtime MAGA champion and ally of Trump, who remains neutral in the Senate GOP primary race.",
      "GOP SENATE CAMPAIGN CHIEF AIMS TO EXPAND 2026 MAP IN THIS BLUE-LEANING STATE",
      "Cornyn, highlighting his Trump credentials, noted that \"I get along well with the President. I've supported him during his first term, and now in his second term, I think the figure we came up with was 99.3% of the time. So I want the president to be successful and look forward to continuing to support him and his policies.\"",
      "But he acknowledged that \"I don't think he's [Trump] in a big hurry to endorse. He says that both the attorney general and I are friends of his, and I don't think he wants to disappoint some of his friends who support one or the other of us, if he...goes to support one and not the other.\"",

      "The Republican primary in Texas has become explosive, with charges flying from all sides.",
      "But Cornyn, remaining more diplomatic than incendiary, merely touted that he would be the most effective general election candidate. And he pointed to Paxton and Hunt and argued, \"They\u2019re probably not going to be able to win, certainly by the same margin, and they might not be able to win at all because they're flawed candidates.\"",

      "\"I've been through a lot of races before. This is nothing new for me, and we look forward to a good primary on March the third and probably a runoff that will finish the race off in May, and then we'll get ready for whoever the Democrats decide to nominate for November,\" he added.",
      "Paxton campaign spokesman Nick Maddux, pushing back against Cornyn, told Fox News Digital, \"Everyone knows that Jasmine Crockett, who said Hispanic Trump voters have a 'slave mentality,' is going to lose the general election miserably after winning the Democratic nomination. Cornyn's reciting this tired talking point about the general election because his sad campaign has nothing else to talk about it.\"",

      "\"Ken Paxton won his last statewide general election by nearly double digits, despite tens of millions in negative spending against him, and he'll do exactly that again in 2026,\" Maddux predicted.",
      "Cornyn, who is running for a fifth six-year term representing Texas in the Senate, announced his re-election campaign in early March, with Paxton launching his primary challenge a month later.",
      "Hunt, a West Point graduate who flew Apache helicopters during his Army service and a rising MAGA star who is in his second term representing a solidly Republican district in the Houston-area, jumped into the race in October.",
      "As he declared his candidacy, Hunt showcased his own Trump credentials, saying, \"I was the first person in the nation to endorse President Trump, and I have remained steadfast in my commitment to the people of Texas.\"",
      "Hunt had been mulling a Senate run for months and sources confirmed to Fox News earlier this year that the congressman made his case to Trump\u2019s political team that he's the only person who could win both a GOP primary and a general election.",

      "Asked about Hunt, Cornyn claimed that \"he can't win the primary. He can force a runoff.\"",

      "\"He refuses to step aside and pass the torch to a new generation of leadership, one aligned with the America First movement and committed to codifying President Trump\u2019s agenda, something Cornyn has spent years opposing in the United States Senate,\" Hunt charged.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips for safe holiday shopping and finding the best deals on Cyber Monday.",
      "Christmas is around the corner, and so is the SantaStealer malware. While the name sounds jolly, this malware is more than capable of ruining your happiness this festive season. The worst part is that this new strain is available to almost anyone willing to pay a small fee. It essentially works as malware-as-a-service, letting buyers target people at scale, obviously not for any legitimate use.",
      "SantaStealer is starting to make noise across Telegram channels and underground hacker forums. It is being marketed as a stealthy, memory-only information stealer that can quietly siphon data without leaving obvious traces on disk.",
      "Memory-only does not mean undetectable. It simply reduces disk artifacts, which can delay detection rather than prevent it altogether. That promise alone is enough to attract cybercriminals, especially at a time when browser-stored passwords, session cookies and crypto wallets remain high-value targets.",

      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "SantaStealer malware is spreading ahead of Christmas, with cybercriminals marketing the data-stealing tool for hire across Telegram and underground forums. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SantaStealer and how it actually works",
      "SantaStealer operates as a malware-as-a-service, charging $175 per month for its basic tier and $300 per month for the premium plan. Researchers at Rapid7 say the operation rebrands an earlier project called BluelineStealer, with a Russian-speaking developer pushing toward a wider launch before the end of the year.",
      "Despite bold claims about evading detection, Rapid7's analysis paints a more grounded picture. The samples they examined were not particularly difficult to analyze and lacked the advanced anti-analysis techniques being advertised, which is good news for us. If it can be detected, security tools have a better chance of removing it before it can do serious damage.",
      "Functionally, SantaStealer is still dangerous. It uses 14 separate data-collection modules that run in parallel, pulling information from browsers, messaging apps like Telegram and Discord, gaming platforms such as Steam, crypto wallet apps and extensions, and even local documents. The malware can also take screenshots of your desktop. Stolen data is written to memory, compressed into ZIP files and sent out in 10MB chunks to a hardcoded command-and-control server.",
      "One notable capability is its use of an embedded executable to get around Chrome's App-Bound Encryption, a security feature introduced in mid-2024. This workaround typically requires the malware to be executed at the user level and is not a remote bypass of Chrome's security model. Similar tricks have already been used by other info-stealers, showing how quickly attackers test and adapt to new browser protections.",
      "What this says about the current threat landscape",
      "SantaStealer is not fully operational yet and has not been distributed at scale, but it reflects a broader trend in cybercrime. Modern info-stealers are modular, configurable and sold much like regular software. The affiliate panel that Rapid7 observed allows buyers to fine-tune exactly what data the malware steals, from full system sweeps to narrowly targeted attacks focused on specific apps or crypto wallets.",
      "The malware also includes options to avoid infecting systems in certain regions and to delay execution, which can throw off both victims and security analysts. As for how SantaStealer might spread, researchers say recent campaigns increasingly rely on ClickFix-style attacks. These tricks push victims into pasting malicious commands directly into the Windows terminal, often disguised as steps to fix an issue or enable a feature.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "At 18, Jamie Grohsong was living a dream many young athletes chase for years. He was a three-time all-conference shortstop, a Division I college prospect and a player who lived for the game. Then one Fourth of July night in 2023, everything changed. A firework exploded in his hand. In seconds, Jamie lost his pitching hand, his season and what felt like his entire baseball future. The path he had worked toward since childhood disappeared. For a while, Jamie accepted that reality. Baseball, the sport that shaped his identity, was over.",

      "Jamie Grohsong throws a baseball using a bionic prosthetic hand after losing his pitching hand in a fireworks accident. His return shows how technology can help athletes reclaim what they love. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When technology reopens a closed door",
      "Two years later, Jamie stepped back onto a baseball field wearing something he never imagined using. A bionic prosthetic known as the Ability Hand.",
      "\"The fact that I can feel and sense everything to the finest details opened my mind to the possibility of everything that could actually be done,\" he told CyberGuy.",
      "The goal was not to recreate the past. It was to find out what might still be possible.",
      "Engineers who build advanced prosthetic hands saw Jamie's story and reached out with a simple question. What if he did not have to give up the game entirely? That question started an extraordinary journey that blended grit, patience and cutting-edge engineering.",
      "\"When building the Ability Hand, we prioritized real-life usage,\" Dr. Aadeel Akhtar, founder and CEO of PSYONIC, told CyberGuy. \"While we already put the hand through its fair share of stress tests, baseball is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Baseball is definitely a brutal test for any piece of equipment. Throwing requires precise release timing. Hitting demands force, stability and follow-through. At first, nothing came easily.",
      "Learning how to throw again",
      "Throwing a baseball with a bionic hand is not about raw strength. It is about timing and grip. The Ability Hand uses muscle sensors that detect subtle movements in the arm. During a throw, many muscles activate at once, which can cause the hand to open too early. Early throws slipped away. Some felt right. Others did not.",
      "Instead of forcing the hand to grip harder, the PSYONIC team adjusted the technique. Jamie learned to hold the ball lightly and let momentum release it naturally. Small grip changes made a real difference. Slowly, throws began to land. Then they became repeatable. For Jamie, each clean throw rebuilt confidence that had been missing for two years.",

      "The surprise moment at Oracle Park",
      "Just as Jamie started throwing again, another door opened. He received an invitation to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the San Francisco Giants' Oracle Park. It was the team he grew up watching. The timeline was tight. He had barely over a week to prepare.",
      "The pitch was not perfect. That never mattered. Standing on a Major League Baseball field with a bionic hand, Jamie proved something bigger than accuracy. He showed that the game was still part of him. Later, he said the experience taught him that life does not require perfection to be meaningful.",

      "Wearing a multi-articulating bionic hand, Jamie Grohsong proves baseball is still part of his identity two years after a devastating accident. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can you actually hit with a bionic hand?",
      "Throwing was only part of the challenge.\u00a0Hitting posed an even bigger question.",
      "\"Swinging a bat was a feeling I didn't think I'd feel again,\" Jamie said.",
      "Engineers discovered that bat placement matters more with prosthetics than with natural hands. When the bionic hand serves as the bottom hand on the bat, impact spreads across the fingers. When it sits on top, stress concentrates on the thumb. Jamie bats left-handed, which placed the prosthetic in a safer position. He told CyberGuy,\u00a0\"I can hit with this thing for sure.\"",
      "Then came the first swings. The sensation was unfamiliar. The contact felt strange. Still, the bat met the ball. One swing turned into another. Soon, balls started flying deep into the field. Then it happened. Jamie sent one over the fence.",
      "A world-first moment",
      "Those swings marked what many believe to be the first documented home runs hit using a multi-articulating bionic hand. For Jamie, it was more than a technical milestone. It was emotional closure and a new beginning at the same time. He was not trying to prove that prosthetics make athletes better. He was proving that they can help people reconnect with what they love. The bionic hand did not replace his identity. It gave him a new way to express it.",

      "What this story says about resilience and design",
      "Jamie's comeback highlights a larger truth about modern assistive technology. At its best, design focuses on real-life use rather than lab conditions. Even so, advanced prosthetics remain expensive and imperfect, and they can break under stress. Because of that, users need time, training and patience to adapt. Yet stories like this show how powerful thoughtful engineering can be when it works alongside human determination.

      "Scammers steal photos from public social media accounts and manipulate them to create fake proof of life images that fuel fear and urgency. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the fake kidnapping scam works",
      "According to the FBI, scammers usually start with a text message. They claim they have kidnapped a loved one and demand immediate payment for their release. To make the threat feel real, the criminals send an altered photo pulled from social media. The FBI says these images may be sent using timed messages to limit how long victims can examine them. The agency warns that scammers often threaten extreme violence if the ransom is not paid right away. This urgency is designed to shut down rational thinking.",
      "Signs the photo may be fake",
      "When victims slow down and look closely, the altered images often fall apart. The FBI says warning signs may include missing scars or tattoos, strange body proportions or details that do not match reality. Scammers may also spoof a loved one's phone number, which makes the message feel even more convincing. Reports on sites like Reddit show this tactic is already being used in the real world.",
      "Why this fake kidnapping scam is so effective",
      "Virtual kidnapping scams work because they exploit emotion. Fear pushes people to act fast, especially when the message appears to come from someone they trust. The FBI notes that criminals use publicly available information to personalize their threats. Even posts meant to help others, such as missing person searches, can provide useful details for scammers.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A major data breach tied to U.S. fintech firm Marquis is rippling through banks, credit unions and their customers. Hackers broke into Marquis systems by exploiting a known but unpatched vulnerability in a SonicWall firewall, gaining access to deeply sensitive consumer data.",
      "At least 400,000 people are confirmed to be affected so far across multiple states. Texas has been hit the hardest with more than 354,000 residents affected. That number is expected to rise as additional breach notifications are filed.",
      "Marquis operates as a marketing and compliance provider for financial institutions. The company says it serves more than 700 banks and credit unions nationwide. That role gives Marquis access to centralized pools of customer data, which also makes it a high-value target.",

      "A major data breach tied to fintech firm Marquis exposed sensitive banking and identity data for hundreds of thousands of people. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information was stolen in the Marquis cyberattack",
      "According to legally required disclosures filed in Texas, Maine, Iowa, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, hackers accessed a wide range of personal and financial data. Stolen information includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account, debit and credit card numbers. The breach dates back to Aug. 14, when attackers gained access through the SonicWall firewall vulnerability. Marquis later confirmed the incident was a ransomware attack.",
      "While Marquis did not publicly name the attackers, the campaign has been widely linked to the Akira ransomware gang. Akira has previously targeted organizations running SonicWall appliances during large-scale exploitation waves. This was not a routine credential leak.",
      "We reached out to Marquis for comment, and a company spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"In August, Marquis Marketing Services experienced a data security incident. Upon discovery, we immediately enacted our response protocols and proactively took the affected systems offline to protect our data and our customers\u2019 information. We engaged leading third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation and notified law enforcement.",
      "\"The incident was quickly contained, and our investigation was recently completed. It was determined that an unauthorized third party accessed certain non-public information within our network. However, there is no evidence indicating that any personal information has been used for identity theft or financial fraud. We have notified potentially affected individuals.",
      "\"We know our customers place great trust in us, and at Marquis, we take that responsibility seriously by making the protection of their information our highest priority. We are extremely appreciative of the cooperation, understanding, and support of our employees and customers during this time.\"",
      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "Why the Marquis data breach creates long-term identity risk",
      "When a data breach exposes your full identity, the danger does not disappear after the news cycle ends. Unlike a stolen password, this kind of information cannot be changed, which means the risk can stick around for a long time.",
      "\"With a typical credential leak, you reset passwords, rotate tokens and move on,\" Ricardo Amper, CEO and Founder of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, tells CyberGuy. \"But core identity data is static. You cannot meaningfully change your date of birth or SSN, and once those are exposed, they can circulate on criminal markets for years. The breach is a moment in time, but the exposure it creates can follow people for the rest of their financial lives.\"",
      "That is why identity breaches are so dangerous. Criminals can reuse the same stolen data years later to open new accounts, build fake identities or run highly targeted scams that feel personal and convincing. Many attackers now combine this data with AI tools to scale their efforts. As a result, phishing emails, phone calls and even voice impersonations are harder to spot when they reference real details about your bank or account history.",
      "The most likely scams after identity data is stolen",
      "When criminals obtain verified identity data, fraud becomes targeted rather than opportunistic.",
      "\"Once criminals get their hands on rich, verified identity data, fraud stops being a guessing game and becomes a targeted execution,\" Amper said.",
      "The first major threat is account takeover. With enough personal details, attackers can bypass knowledge-based checks, reset passwords, change contact information and abuse accounts in ways that often look legitimate. The second risk is new account fraud. This includes credit cards, loans, buy now pay later services and even new bank accounts. High-quality data helps these applications pass automated systems and manual reviews.",
      "The fastest-growing threat is synthetic identity fraud. Real data, like a Social Security number, is blended with fabricated details to create a new identity that matures over time before a large financial bust.",
      "\"These attacks are hard to catch early because the data being presented is accurate and often reused across multiple institutions,\" Amper noted. \"If your defenses can't reliably tell a real human from an AI-generated impersonation, you are starting every decision from a position of disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Why unpatched firewall flaws pose such a serious threat",
      "Ransomware groups like Akira increasingly focus on widely deployed infrastructure to maximize impact. Firewalls sit at the boundary of trusted networks. When one is compromised, everything behind it becomes reachable.",
      "\"What we're seeing with groups like Akira is a focus on maximizing impact by targeting widely used infrastructure. The strategy remains the same: Find a single weak point that gives access to many downstream victims at once,\" Amper said.",
      "This approach exposes a persistent blind spot in traditional cybersecurity thinking. Many organizations still assume traffic passing through a firewall is safe.",
      "\"When the perimeter device itself is the entry point, static defenses and outdated controls simply can't keep up,\" Amper explained.",
      "Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers and bank details by exploiting an unpatched firewall vulnerability.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How long affected consumers should assume risk remains high",
      "Identity data does not expire. Social Security numbers and birth dates stay the same for life.",
      "\"When core identity data reaches criminal markets, the risk does not fade quickly,\" Amper emphasized. \"Fraud rings treat stolen identity data like inventory. They hold it, bundle it, resell it and combine it with information from new breaches.\"",
      "Warning signs of misuse can be subtle. These include credit inquiries you did not authorize, account recovery alerts from unfamiliar services or phone calls that convincingly mimic a bank's verification process using deepfake voice tools.",
      "\"The most damaging fraud often starts long after the breach is no longer in the news,\" Amper added.",
      "The overlooked impact of identity theft",
      "Financial losses are only part of the damage. Victims often experience a lasting erosion of trust.",
      "Amper says, \"The most overlooked consequence is the psychological toll of knowing that you can no longer trust who is contacting you. Deepfake impersonation turns every phone call, video message or urgent request into a potential attack.\"",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Marquis data breach",
      "When a breach exposes Social Security numbers, bank details and birth dates, the risk does not end with a password reset. These steps focus on protections that reduce long-term identity misuse and help you detect fraud early.",
      "A credit freeze prevents criminals from opening new accounts in your name using stolen identity data. This is critical after the Marquis breach, where full identity profiles were exposed. Freezing credit does not affect your score and can be lifted temporarily when needed. Place a free credit freeze with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion online or by phone. Each bureau must be contacted separately. Once frozen, new credit cannot be opened unless you temporarily lift or remove the freeze using a PIN or account login.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. It adds protection if you are not ready to freeze credit everywhere or want an extra layer on top of a freeze. Fraud alerts last for one year and can be renewed. You only need to contact one credit bureau to place a fraud alert. Equifax, Experian or TransUnion will notify the others for you. Fraud alerts are free and last for one year.",
      "Turn on alerts for withdrawal, purchase, login attempts and password changes across all financial accounts. Real-time alerts can help you catch account takeovers or unauthorized activity before serious damage occurs.",
      "Check statements and credit reports often, even months or years after the breach. Identity data from incidents like this is frequently reused later for delayed fraud. Watch for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or small test charges.",
      "Text message codes can be intercepted or socially engineered. Where possible, switch to app-based or hardware-backed two-factor authentication. These options are harder for attackers to bypass, even when they know your personal details.",
      "Biometrics tied to your physical device add a layer that criminals cannot easily replicate. Face and fingerprint authentication help block account takeovers driven by stolen identity data or AI-powered impersonation.",
      "Reputable antivirus software helps detect malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up attacks that target breach victims. This adds protection against phishing and ransomware tied to identity-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "Data brokers collect and resell personal information that can be combined with breach data to fuel targeted fraud. A data removal service reduces how much of your personal information is publicly available and lowers your exposure over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Experts warn this type of identity exposure can fuel fraud and scams for years after the breach is discovered. (Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson)",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Identity theft services monitor credit files, dark web markets and account activity for signs that your stolen data is being misused. Many also offer recovery assistance in the event of fraud, which can save time and stress when dealing with banks, credit bureaus and government agencies. This monitoring is especially useful after breaches like Marquis, where identity data can resurface long after the initial incident.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Be cautious of urgent calls, emails or texts that reference real banking or personal details. Scammers now use accurate breach data to sound legitimate. Hang up and contact your bank directly using the number on your card or official website.",
      "Create or secure online accounts with the IRS, Social Security Administration and your state tax agency. Enable strong authentication and monitor for unexpected notices. Stolen identity data is often used for tax refund fraud or benefit scams long after a breach.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Marquis data breach highlights how dangerous unpatched infrastructure vulnerabilities have become for the financial sector. When a single vendor holds data for hundreds of institutions, the fallout spreads quickly. For you, identity protection is no longer a one-time response. It is an ongoing necessity that can last years beyond the initial breach.",

In some cases, like one Maryland woman found out, you may even receive\u00a0fake deliveries with a QR code\u00a0that works in a similar way.",

      "How scammers know your address, phone number, and shopping habits",

      "These data brokers can sell profiles containing hundreds of data points on you. And they aren't always discerning about who they sell to. In fact, some of them have been caught intentionally selling data to scammers.",
      "Once scammers have those details, creating a convincing delivery scam is no problem.",
      "But scammers can't target what they can't find",
      "I've been very vocal about the importance of keeping personal information under lock and key. And this is just one of the reasons why.",
      "Criminals rely on your personal information to target you with these types of scams. They also need at least a phone number or email address to reach you in the first place.",
      "So your best bet to avoid delivery scams (and, honestly, most other scams year-round) is removing your info from data brokers and people search sites. Doing this will keep your details out of circulation online and out of the wrong hands.",

      "Fraudsters use spoofed shipping pages and malware to capture passwords and gain access to victims\u2019 devices. (Martin Ollman/Getty Images)",
      "How to remove your personal information from scammers' reach",
      "You can start by looking yourself up online. Searching for different combinations of your name, address, email, and phone number should bring up a bunch of people search sites. Just visit the \"opt-out\" page on each site to request removal of your data.",
      "Private-database data brokers are a bit trickier. They sell data in bulk, usually to marketers and other third parties. So you won't be able to check if they have your information. But if you look into which data brokers operate in your area, you can just send opt-out requests to them all. There's a good chance they'll have your information.",
      "You can also turn to a data removal service. They completely remove the headache from this process and just automatically keep your personal info off data broker sites. If, like me, you don't have the time to keep manually checking data broker sites and sending removal requests every few months (because your data will keep reappearing), a personal data removal service is the way to go.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Holiday delivery scams work because they blend perfectly into the chaos of December shopping. A well-timed text and a familiar tracking link are often all it takes to lower your guard. By slowing down, checking messages directly with retailers, and reducing how much of your personal data is circulating online, you can take away the advantage scammers rely on. A little caution now can save you a major headache later.",

      "An AI photo-matching on Petco Love Lost helped reunite a Texas family with their missing cat after 103 days. (ULISES RUIZ/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "How AI photo matching kept the search going",
      "Pam's 11-year-old indoor cat, Grayson, had never been outside alone. She believes he slipped out while she unloaded groceries at their home in Plano, Texas. The moment she realized he was gone, she acted fast.",
      "She said, \"We went up and down the streets day and night. We went online in the neighborhood and on Love Lost. We put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Friends and neighbors were looking for him. I went to the animal shelter, posted him there, and went every day for over a month, hoping to find him.\"",
      "Pam uploaded Grayson's photo to Petco Love Lost right away. She checked her daily match alerts and hoped she would see his familiar face pop up. She told CyberGuy, \"I received match alerts almost every day from Lost Love, but never saw Grayson. His profile had been on their site for over 90 days.\"",
      "The moment everything changed",
      "Missy, a nearby resident, spotted a thin cat in an alley near her home. She brought him inside, took a picture of him and then turned to Love Lost to see if anyone had reported a missing cat like him.",
      "Missy explained how simple the process felt. \"I used Lost Love to reunite them,\" she said. \"I uploaded a photo of the cat that we found, and it was matched through AI with the photo that the owner uploaded.\"",
      "She soon received an AI match alert and learned that the cross street Grayson's owner, Pam, had listed in her lost post was only a mile from her home. Missy contacted Pam right away.",
      "That message changed everything. \"I am sure that if we had not posted his picture and enabled the ability to match the images, we would never have known what happened to Grayson,\" Pam said. \"And we would not have connected with Missy.\"",

      "A long road for an aging cat",
      "Grayson is almost 12 and has never lived outdoors. That made this reunion feel even more emotional, Pam said.",
      "\"I am still amazed at Grayson's journey,\" she added. \"I look at him and cannot believe he made it through those 103 days. He is almost 12 years old, so he is not a young kitty.\"",
      "Pam said she still thinks about what those months were like for him. \"[I] guess I will always wonder where he was and how many stops he made before he reached Missy's loving home,\" she said. \"He must have known she would take care of him. It takes a special person to take the time to reunite a beloved pet with their family. Missy and her family went above and beyond to reunite us with Grayson.\"",
      "Why pet tech matters during the holidays",

      "What to do if your pet goes missing",
      "Losing a pet can feel overwhelming, but taking fast action helps. These steps guide you through what to do right away.",
      "Look in closets, garages and under furniture. Walk your street and ask neighbors to check yards and sheds.",
      "Take a clear photo and post it on the site. AI photo matching alerts you when a possible match appears. It also helps others contact you fast.",
      "Shelters update kennels throughout the day. Staff can guide you and help flag your pet's profile. Go often until you get updates.",
      "Use neighborhood apps, local Facebook groups and community forums. Include your pet's photo, last known location and your contact info.",
      "Use a large photo and simple details. Place flyers at busy intersections and near schools, parks and businesses.",
      "If your pet is microchipped, call the registry or log in to your account. Make sure the chip is registered to you, update your contact info and mark your pet as missing so shelters and vets can reach you fast.",

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

      "The proposed changes include federal offenses for \"aggravated hate speech\" aimed at preachers who promote violence and \"serious vilification\" based on race, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. The outlet noted that just 10 months ago, the government strengthened federal hate speech laws with the goal of curbing antisemitism and Islamophobia.",
      "Simultaneously, New South Wales (NSW), where the terror attack took place, is considering banning chants of the phrase \"globalize the intifada,\" which many consider to be an antisemitic call for violence against Jews. The ban would also apply to public displays of ISIS flags and extremist symbols.",

      "Melodee Buzzard's mother was arrested Tuesday and accused in the death of her 9-year-old daughter after the girl's body was found in a rural area of Utah more than two months after she disappeared in Southern California.",
      "Investigators uncovered a \"significant amount of evidence\" that indicated that Ashlee Buzzard, 40, killed her daughter, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown told reporters. Buzzard is being held without bail on suspicion of first-degree murder, Brown said.",
      "\"Maternal filicide is rare and always difficult to comprehend,\" he said. \"This level of criminal activity is particularly shocking given the calculated, cold-blooded and criminally sophisticated premeditation and heartlessness that went into planning it.\"",
      "Melodee's body was found Dec. 6 by a man and a woman who were taking pictures in Wayne County, Utah, Brown said. It was clear that the body was that of a girl who \"died from gunshot wounds to the head,\" Brown said.",
      "An FBI analysis of DNA confirmed the body was Melodee's, Brown said.",
      "Officials searched Buzzard's home, a rented storage locker and a rental car and found an expended cartridge case, as well as a live round of similar ammunition, officials said. A murder weapon has not yet been found, officials said.",
      "\"Our investigators and those of our allied agencies worked simultaneously on multiple fronts, some maintaining around-the-clock surveillance of Ashley Buzzard, while others focused on the painstaking collection, analysis and verification of physical, digital and forensic evidence,\" Brown said.",
      "Neighbors said they saw deputies taking Buzzard from her home in Vandenberg Village early Tuesday, according to NBC News affiliate KSBY of San Luis Obispo. Buzzard had been uncooperative during the search and the investigation into Melodee's disappearance, sheriff's officials have said.",
      "Lompoc Unified School District said in a statement in October that Buzzard took Melodee to an independent study program in August to enroll but that the girl did not attend through early October, prompting a series of responses to truancy that culminated in notifying law enforcement.",
      "Investigators have focused their attention on a road trip the pair took from Southern California to Nebraska from Oct. 7 to Oct. 10.",
      "Security video showed Melodee wearing a wig on Oct. 7 at the rental car business where they picked up a Chevrolet Malibu, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Detectives believe the wig was used to throw off attempts to track or find her, and they said her mother was known to wear them.",
      "At some point during the trip, the rental car's license plate was temporarily switched to a New York plate, allegedly to avoid detection, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Authorities said Melodee was last seen on the return leg of the trip on Oct. 9, near the Utah-Colorado border, but was not with Ashlee Buzzard when she returned home with the rental vehicle on Oct. 10, detectives said in a series of updates.",
      "Investigators believe Melodee was killed shortly after the stop at the Utah-Colorado border, Brown said.",
      "Sheriff's deputies arrested Ashlee Buzzard on suspicion of felony false imprisonment in a separate case on Nov. 7. A man testified that she held him against his will at her home and had a box cutter, KSBY reported. The charge was dismissed Nov. 20, with prosecutors later citing contradictory information and insufficient evidence, a spokesperson for the regional district attorney said.",
      "Attempts to reach Ashlee Buzzard since late October have been unsuccessful, and her mother, reached by phone, declined to comment.",
      "Melodee's disappearance stirred concern among some in her community of Vandenberg Village, about 160 miles northwest of Los Angeles. People have sometimes gathered outside her home and shouted questions about her whereabouts.",
      "Corinna Meza, Melodee\u2019s half-sister, said, \"We\u2019re all looking for answers,\u201d KSBY reported. She said that Melodee's father died when her little sister was a baby and that the girl had rarely been seen, even among family."

    "story": [
      "In his almost 45 years as a federal judge, John Coughenour has seen it all, including high-profile criminal trials that put his own safety at risk.",
      "But this year, the 84-year-old senior district judge did something he hadn\u2019t considered for a long time: He retrieved a gun he had stored at the federal courthouse in Seattle years ago and brought it back to his home in case he needed it to defend himself.",
      "Coughenour is one of dozens of federal judges who have found themselves at the center of a political maelstrom as they have ruled against President Donald Trump or spoken up in defense of the judiciary. With Trump administration officials vilifying judges who rule against the government, a wave of violent threats and harassment has often followed.",
      "On Jan 23, just three days after Trump took office, Coughenour blocked an executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship, calling the proposal \u201cblatantly unconstitutional.\u201d He was the first of several judges to rule against the administration on the issue, which is now before the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThey put it before a certain judge in Seattle I guess, right? And there\u2019s no surprises with that judge,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office later that same day. Coughenour was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981.",
      "The negative reaction soon followed.",
      "Within days, Coughenour was \u201cswatted,\u201d which is when someone calls police with a false claim about a purportedly serious ongoing situation, sometimes with dangerous consequences when armed police arrive. In this instance, an anonymous person told the local sheriff\u2019s department that the judge was barricaded into his house and had murdered his wife.",
      "Then, another caller told law enforcement there was a bomb in Coughenour\u2019s mailbox.",
      "In both instances, local law enforcement went to his house and swiftly realized there was no genuine threat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a gun nut,\u201d Coughenour said in an interview. But in light of these threats, \u201cI have armed myself.\u201d",
      "Other judges have been targets of anonymous pizza deliveries that judges see as a form of intimidation. The U.S. Marshals Service, which has the job of protecting judges, suspects some of the deliveries could be tied to foreign actors, three sources told NBC News.",
      "As a result of the various threats and intimidation, judges have had to adapt their daily lives, according to NBC News interviews with six sitting judges, as well as former judges and others familiar with the current threat landscape.",
      "One judge moved house. Another had to freeze her credit cards after a security breach.",
      "Other judges have taken actions to adapt to the changing landscape by upgrading home security systems, changing the route they drive to work and ensuring family members limit personal information they post online, according to the current and former judges.",
      "Coughenour pointed to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh criticism of judges, whom it has portrayed as biased and out of control. Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has described rulings against the president as a \u201cjudicial coup\u201d and Attorney General Pam Bondi has talked about \u201clow-level leftist judges.\u201d Some MAGA influencers have called for judges who stymie the administration\u2019s agenda to be impeached and removed from office.",
      "\u201cThe things they say and descriptions they use \u2014 I blame them for stirring this stuff up,\u201d Coughenour said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson defended the administration\u2019s criticisms of judges, pointing out in a statement last week that the Supreme Court has regularly blocked the same rulings the White House has taken issue with.",
      "\u201cAny implication, by NBC, that sharing the truth is akin to making threats is deeply unserious and should be dismissed by anyone with half a brain,\u201d she added. \u201cThe Trump Administration cares deeply for the safety of all members of the Judicial Branch and will continue enacting the agenda President Trump was elected to fulfill.\u201d",
      "'You alter your lifestyle'",
      "Kansas City-based U.S. District Judge Stephen Bough, a Democratic appointee who in April ruled against the Trump administration over its attempt to deport five Missouri college students, then received unsolicited pizzas at 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. His daughter, who lives 800 miles away in Atlanta, also received a pizza.",
      "The deliveries to their home addresses are \u201ca new way of intimidating judges,\u201d Bough said in an interview.",
      "Bough notified the U.S. Marshals, which worked with local police to increase patrols. He also worked with his homeowners association to improve his own security.",
      "\u201cYou alter your lifestyle and try to encourage your family to do the same. It feels like things are different now,\u201d he said, referring to family members being targeted.",
      "A Trump-appointed judge who faced death threats after a high-profile ruling against the Trump administration also told NBC News he was worried more about his family than himself. His wife was overseas at the time of the threats, which added to his unease, he said in an interview given on condition of anonymity given his safety concerns.",
      "\u201cShe felt vulnerable, exposed, frightened,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what struck me.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath, the family enhanced security at home.",
      "\u201cThis is a world none of us thought we would be living in,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The judge who moved did so in the aftermath of a high-profile ruling against the Trump administration because of concerns his location was not secure, according to one serving federal judge and one retired judge who both have direct knowledge of the situation. They both declined to name the judge in question over concerns about his safety.",
      "New Jersey-based U.S. District Judge Esther Salas, a Democratic appointee, had to cancel her credit cards when she was notified of a security breach connected to her professional role soon after she spoke out in defense of fellow judges, she told NBC News.",
      "There have also been unsuccessful attempts to deliver pizzas to her this year, she added, with orders sent to her former addresses, not her current one.",
      "Salas has been the public face of the judiciary this year in raising concerns about security threats. In 2020, her son, Daniel Anderl, was murdered by a disgruntled lawyer who came to her home. Her husband was also shot. The incident prompted her to take a more visible role in pushing for greater protections for judges.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s important for us now, at this time in our country\u2019s history, to really speak out against all of this intimidation, this violence, these threats to the judiciary and its independence,\u201d she said.",
      "A foreign connection",
      "One prominent trend this year has been the pizza deliveries, some of which may be tied to foreign actors, three sources said.",
      "Like Bough, senior U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik, a Democratic appointee who serves in the Western District of Washington, said in an interview that he and two of his adult children received pizza deliveries.",
      "\u201cThe message was, we know where you live, we know where your kids live, and one of them could end up dead, like Judge Salas\u2019 son,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s a twist on other forms of harassment, such as \u201cdoxing,\u201d when personal information is publicly released, as well as  \u201cswatting.\u201d",
      "The Marshals Service told Salas in May that there had been 103 pizza deliveries to judges who ruled against the Trump administration or spoke out about threats against the judiciary, 20 of which were sent to others in the name of her late son, she told NBC News. The Marshals Service has since told Salas there have been more, but she declined to give an exact number.",
      "\u201cThese bad actors continue to use my murdered son\u2019s name as an attempt to inflict fear on my colleagues all throughout this country,\u201d Salas said.",
      "Two federal judges said in interviews that they were told by the Marshals Service that it suspected foreign involvement. There was no mention of a specific country in those conversations, the judges added.",
      "Ron Zayas, a cybersecurity expert who contracts with federal courts, said in an interview that his own company\u2019s investigation also found signs of foreign intervention, adding that it had the hallmarks of Russia-allied activity. The investigation found that while the initial wave of pizza deliveries may have started organically, it was quickly seized upon by foreign actors.",
      "\u201cThe groups that were having the conversations, and in the rooms where we saw the conversations, they tend to be related to the Russian government, or were known to be affiliated and be sympathetic to Russian causes,\u201d he added, referring to, for example, the online forums where the conversations take place. \u201cIt\u2019s just a way to destabilize.\u201d",
      "Zayas added that his investigation did not dig deep enough to definitively tie the activity to Russia.",
      "The Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "Zayas\u2019 company, Ironwall, helps judges scrub their personal information from the internet. Federal judges are already protected under a federal law passed in the aftermath of Anderl\u2019s murder that allows their personal information to be redacted or removed from easily accessible websites that might, for example, show where they live. But Zayas says information can still be available on the dark web.",
      "A Marshals Service spokesperson declined to comment on any potential foreign involvement, saying only that the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Threats rising over the last decade",
      "The Marshals Service has an increasingly large number of threats against judges to investigate. According to the agency\u2019s own data, there were 564 threats against judges in fiscal year 2025 and there have already been 131 since October. A spokesman declined to comment on the current state of any of the investigations.",
      "The number of threats against judges has tripled over the last decade, not just when Trump has been in office, Chief Justice John Roberts said in his annual report on the judiciary last year. NBC News reported in September that some federal judges were upset that Roberts and his colleagues on the Supreme Court had not done enough to stick up for them in the face of the hostile criticism and rise in threats.",
      "Judges who spoke to NBC News for this article do not fault the Marshals Service, which has a tight budget despite the increased burden on its limited resources. While courthouses are secure, judges feel more vulnerable when at home. The Marshals Service helps set up home security, but it does not provide round-the-clock protection at home unless the judge is subject to a specific threat.",
      "As judges wrestle with the additional burdens associated with the job, some of them worry about the longer-term impacts, including on people who might be deterred from seeking judgeships in the future.",
      "\u201cJudges signed up to try their best to be neutral arbiters of the law and to follow precedent, and for it now to be at a point where I have to worry about the safety of my spouse and my children, that changes the entire dynamic,\u201d Bough said.",
      "While Coughenour has found himself a target this year, his main concern is not for his own safety, but that of his younger colleagues who may have children at home, and more broadly the nation as a whole.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 84 years old. Threats against my life expectancy are kind of hollow. I don\u2019t have much time anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned that our democracy is at risk because of the trends against the rule of law.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A long-awaited change in drug policy could bring scientists one step closer to understanding the harms and benefits of marijuana, the most commonly used federally illegal substance.",
      "On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that moved to reclassify cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, following through on a regulatory shift first pushed during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cDecades of federal drug control policy have neglected marijuana\u2019s medical uses,\u201d the order says. \u201cThat oversight has limited the ability of scientists and manufacturers to complete the necessary research on safety and efficacy to inform doctors and patients.\u201d",
      "While the reclassification is intended to bolster medical marijuana research and won\u2019t legalize cannabis at the federal level, the move comes at a time when use in the United States is at a high. Gallup data from 2023 and 2024 estimates that 15% of adults smoke marijuana, up from 7% in 2013.",
      "The poll, which didn\u2019t differentiate between medical and recreational consumption, showed the highest use (19%) among young adults 18 to 34, a group for whom studies have found cannabis to have damaging psychiatric effects. For example, a study published Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics found that using marijuana as little as once or twice a month was linked to emotional distress and worse school performance among teens.",
      "Medical marijuana is typically prescribed to ease chronic pain; control nausea and vomiting, often in people receiving chemotherapy for cancer; and bring about an appetite in people with certain medical conditions. It\u2019s unclear whether rescheduling cannabis will affect funding for recreational marijuana research.",
      "Scientists like Ziva Cooper are hopeful the reclassification could revolutionize public health through more comprehensive marijuana research.",
      "\u201cIt is extremely difficult to study cannabis, aka marijuana, for both the potential adverse effects as well as therapeutic effects,\u201d said Cooper, director of the Center for Cannabis and Cannabinoids at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cThe industry is developing at a very fast pace, and so consumer behavior is developing along with that industry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us, as scientists, as people who are interested in public health, to be able to keep up with the changes, in part because the research is difficult.\u201d",
      "Schedule I is the strictest of the five controlled substance categories recognized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, reserved for drugs \u201cwith no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,\u201d including ecstasy, heroin, LSD and peyote. Schedule III drugs, which include ketamine, testosterone and anabolic steroids, have \u201ca moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,\u201d according to the agency.",
      "Despite working in a cannabis-friendly state, Cooper said she faces the same research hurdles as her peers in states such as Idaho, where no marijuana use is permitted whatsoever.",
      "\u201cResearchers cannot test what is readily available to the market, just basic questions about what is in those products that are available in the dispensary I can see outside of my laboratory window, for example,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt also means that there are certain restrictions with respect to where we can get our cannabis that we do research on.\u201d",
      "Harms and benefits of marijuana need further study",
      "Last year, the National Institutes of Health awarded $75 million to therapeutic cannabinoid research, up from $70 million in 2023. Additionally, $217 million went to cannabinoids, or cannabis compounds, and $53 million went to cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive cannabinoid.",
      "However, administrative red tape means cannabis studies are often observational, compared with the rigorous clinical trials required of pharmaceutical research, said Dr. Brooke Worster, medical director of the M.S. in medical cannabis science and business program at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Their findings have been mixed.",
      "For example, a 2024 study published in the journal Current Alzheimer Research found that recreational cannabis use among adults 45 and older was associated with a 96% lower risk of subjective cognitive decline, compared with nonusers. Yet a 2025 study published in JAMA Network Open found that among adults 22 to 36, heavy cannabis users showed impaired working memory.",
      "Research published this year in the journal Biomedicines suggested cannabinoids are a \u201cpromising\u201d alternative to opioids for chronic pain management but cited an urgent need for large-scale, randomized controlled trials. Meanwhile, a study published last year in JAMA Network Open found that older, Medicare-insured adults showed increased rates of health care visits involving cannabis-related disorders from 2017 through 2022.",
      "The reclassification will allow researchers to dispense and study specific formulations of marijuana, Worster said. Now, even in states with medical marijuana programs, the quality and potency of cannabis products can vary greatly between dispensaries.",
      "\u201cWe can actively track immediate symptoms or blood levels of things, longer-term effects,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the things you\u2019d want to do when you\u2019re studying a medication, all the things that the federal government otherwise requires us to do to study a medication.\u201d",
      "While marijuana may have some medical benefits for some people, Jonathan Caulkins, the H. Guyford Stever university professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, denied that administrative roadblocks have prevented cannabis from curing ailments such as cancer or Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "\u201cThey do not restrict research in Canada or France or Israel,\u201d Caulkins said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we should imagine that the only reason cannabis hasn\u2019t become the wonder drug is because of anything about U.S. law, because we\u2019re not the only country in the world that has a pharmaceutical industry and a research base.\u201d",
      "Still, the change brings new responsibility to the medical community, Worster said, as smoked and inhaled products of any concentration or formulation aren\u2019t safe for everyone.",
      "\u201cWhat still needs to be figured out is, how do we get the right patient the right medication and the right guidance?\u201d she said. \u201cThe products out there are, a lot of times, not regulated. There are real risks with mental health, with youth who use it too regularly, certainly some cardiovascular effects that we need to pay more attention to.\u201d",
      "Cannabis policy to be revised after 55 years",
      "The regulatory hurdles researchers face date back more than half a century. During the Nixon administration, the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 established cannabis as a Schedule I drug.",
      "Nearly 60 years later, much of marijuana\u2019s medical potential, or lack thereof, remains unknown. In the eyes of the law, Worster said, \u201cit is simply a drug of abuse.\u201d",
      "Susan Ferguson, director of the Addictions, Drug and Alcohol Institute at the University of Washington School of Medicine, anticipates scientists will soon have an easier time acquiring cannabis research licenses. Currently, she said, researchers may obtain a broad license to study any Schedule II through V drug. Those who wish to study a Schedule I drug must get a separate license for each substance.",
      "\u201cIt involves extensive writing of protocols,\u201d she said. \u201cIt involves DEA agents coming out and inspecting the lab and talking to me about the research and the plans for the experiments. It gets very, very complicated.\u201d",
      "Rescheduling marijuana, Ferguson said, would \u201copen the floodgates\u201d for clinical research. For starters, people may be more inclined to enroll in studies of Schedule III rather than Schedule I drugs.",
      "Ferguson likened cannabis to alcohol and tobacco \u2014 products that are commonplace but not harmless. Medical research is the reason their harms are well known.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t done that research on cannabis,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be able to ultimately tell people what are the risks, what are the benefits, and just give people more information.\u201d"

    "summary": "\"Heated Rivalry\" fans explain why the episode went viral and why its impact has been so widespread. What happened in the episode?",
    "story": [
      "Francis Dominic, a content creator based in Los Angeles, watches episodes of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d the moment they drop on HBO Max. When he saw the fifth episode, he knew he wanted to watch it again \u2014 this time, with a crowd.",
      "\u201cI was like, 'Listen, I have to experience this with people,'\u201d Dominic tells TODAY.com.",
      "Dominic headed to a local gay sports bar that has been airing episodes of the romance novel adaptation since Episode 3, demonstrating the snowball effect the show has had since its Nov. 28 premiere.",
      "In his videos from the evening, the crowd cheers during the last scene as if they were experiencing a live sporting event. Other reactions flooding social media are similarly euphoric, with people saying they're watching it \"like it's the Super Bowl.\"",
      "But why has Episode 5 in particular led to such an outpouring of love? Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What Is \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019?",
      "Based on Rachel Reid\u2019s \"Game Changers\" romance novel series, two hockey all-stars fall for each other in \u201cHeated Rivalry.\u201d",
      "Situated within a league that has no openly queer players, Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie) and Shane Hollander (Hudson Williams) feel trapped, especially as their feelings for each other grow.",
      "Full of longing and NSFW scenes, the series has been hailed as a perfect romance novel adaptation by fans and has brought new ones into the fold, hence the crowd at Francis\u2019 local bar.",
      "What Happens in Episode 5 of 'Heated Rivalry'?",
      "Episode 5 continues the dramatic highs and lows of Shane and Ilya. Notable moments include Shane ending his relationship with Rose Landry, Shane getting hurt and taken off the ice on a stretcher with a distraught Ilya looking on, and Ilya confessing he loves Shane (that is, in Russian, a monologue that \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d fans who are native Russian speakers are especially loving.)",
      "But in its final few moments, after four episodes of angst, there's a reprieve, one that fans experienced with joy \u2014\u00a0and documented for social media.",
      "To explain it, we have to go back to Episode 3, which took a detour from Shane and Ilya\u2019s story to focus on another hockey player, New York star Scott Hunter (Francois Arnaud).",
      "While he\u2019s older than Shane and Ilya, who are both in their mid-20s, he's struggling with the same issue. His meet-cute with an aspiring art historian named Kip (Robbie G.K.) led to a real love, but he feels unable to come out. With Kip tired of living under the shadow of a secret romance, they're at a standstill.",
      "Then comes the ending of Episode 5, when Scott\u2019s New York Admirals win the Stanley Cup. As his teammates embrace friends and family on the ice, Scott moves to the edge of the rink and scans the crowd, looking for someone.",
      "Shane and Ilya watch the moment unfold on the TV. That means the fictional characters and the \"Heated Rivalry\" audience experience the shock of what Scott does next: He gestures for Kip to come down to the ice. Then, he kisses him on live TV.",
      "Meanwhile, Shane and Ilya seemingly have their own revelations of what this might mean for their relationship.",
      "At the end of the episode, Ilya calls Shane and takes him up on his offer to spend two weeks alone at his home. For the first time in years, they'll have quality together.",
      "The episode ends with Ilya telling Shane, \u201cI\u2019m coming to the cottage.\u201d",
      "Why Is Episode 5 Such a Big Deal?",
      "While \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has been building momentum since its premiere, Episode 5 has inspired a particular outpouring of emotion.",
      "Ronald Charles Chavis filmed his husband, Refeal Shtivi, weeping after watching the episode in a video shared to TikTok. Speaking to TODAY.com, the couple say the episode\u2019s \u201cgrand gesture\u201d reminded them of their own story. Shtivi was encouraged to come out to the wider world after meeting Chavis in 2023.",
      "\u201cThis coming out part in front of so many people, I did myself. I felt like the big release they were having. I felt super connected with that,\u201d Shtivi says.",
      "\u201cGay, straight \u2014 people want to know that they\u2019re loved,\u201d Chavis adds. \u201cThat was the beauty in that episode.\"",
      "Chavis calls the episode \u201ccathartic\u201d for viewers, especially after the four episodes of build-up.",
      "\u201cIt was such a such a release for them that everybody watching that episode felt it. Because at one point it felt like we were all holding our breath, waiting, and when he did that, it was like it was a sign that everything was going to be OK,\u201d Chavis says.",
      "Dominic points to the widespread pop culture phenomenon of  LGTBQ love stories ending in tragedy. Instead, at the end of \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d Episode 5, a gay love story is \u201cloudly celebrated\" as the crowd in the stadium cheers, too.",
      "\u201cWhat was so great about it is that we finally got a huge happily ever after,\u201d Dominic says. \u201cWhen I watched it by myself, I was sobbing, because it\u2019s like we are constantly fighting for our happily ever after.\u201d",
      "For Dominic, Episode 5\u2019s ending is meta, with consequences reverberating both in the show and in the real world.",
      "\u201cI think seeing Scott choose Kip and bringing him on the ice was so triumphant, because sometimes that just never happens either in real life or in media portraits of gays in their relationship,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cHopefully people will be inspired to live the truth that they\u2019ve always wanted to,\" he said. \"If this is what\u2019s happening right now mainstream media, I\u2019m like, why can\u2019t it happen in real life?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Singer-songwriter Sophia James is responsible for one of the major internet moments of 2025: Group 7, a social media experiment that went extremely viral.",
      "Back in October, James posted seven TikTok videos assigning people to groups one through seven, with her her single \u201cSo Unfair\" playing in the background.",
      "Thanks to the mystery of the algorithm, one of the videos went off. \u201cIf you\u2019re watching this video, you are in group 7,\u201d James said in the 7th video, which amassed 85.6 million views.",
      "What followed was not just a viral moment, but a turning point for James' career, leading to a New York Times profile an in-person group 7 event in Los Angeles.",
      "What comes after group 7? A lot, James says.",
      "Life before and after \u2018group 7\u2019",
      "Before her viral moment, James describes her career as an independent artist as \u201cpretty stagnant.\u201d",
      "She graduated from UCLA with a degree in jazz. \u201cI just knew that I wanted to do music my whole life,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI figured if I had a good understanding of jazz theory and practice, I could translate it easily to whatever genre I chose.\u201d",
      "Since college, she has worked all over the music industry, from session pianist to backup vocalist to touring opener and keyboardist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had my hands in about 10 different pies at any given point, with the intention of making the solo artist career full-time,\u201d James says.",
      "As an independent artist, social media was the \"only tool in her arsenal\" for getting her own music out into the world \u2014 but she did not expect her impulsive batch of videos to blow up. She says she was \u201cjust trying things and feeling silly,\u201d so she was shocked when the seventh video took off.",
      "This journey and group 7 have not only changed her goals, but the scale of her audience and the reach of her music. James gained over 100,000 TikTok followers after going viral, according to The New York Times.",
      "The viral moment also helped James catch the attention of SiriusXM\u2019s Mikey Piff, who discovered her song \u201cSo Unfair\u201d through the group 7 video. James explains that Piff emailed her asking to play her on the station.",
      "\u201cI was like, that\u2019s crazy \u2014 I never, ever thought I would ever have a song on the radio,\u201d James says. \u201cI consider that the pinnacle of a music career.\u201d",
      "James says \u201cSo Unfair\u201d then transferred over to the Hits 1 station because of the positive response to the song.",
      "\u201cAnd so that\u2019s been really unbelievable and very massive,\u201d James says.",
      "Still, life after group 7 can come with pressure. James says she has felt some expectations to recreate the viral success, but she knows it was a \u201clightning in a bottle\u201d moment.",
      "\u201cI will never top the group 7 video, at least on social media,\u201d she says. \u201cThat is my magnum opus on social media.\u201d",
      "New year, new music",
      "James says if people want more excitement, they should turn to her music. Instead of chasing another viral hit, James is focused on building her future. She says her upcoming album, to be released in 2026, represents a creative shift.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the most explorative I\u2019ve ever been in music,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very absurd and playful in a lot of ways, and it\u2019s been really fun to explore that side of artistry.\u201d",
      "James says earlier songs were more \u201cdeeply existential and grim,\u201d where the new album is a lot more \u201cexplosive.\u201d She feels all the feelings, ranging from anger to humor.",
      "\u201cTo be an artist you don\u2019t have to be tortured,\u201d James says. \u201cYou can also be a trickster, you can be playful and excited and angry.\u201d",
      "These feelings in her music are inspired by lived experience, relationships and music she\u2019s listened to across eras. In her mind, these are songs that could be enjoyed and on the radio 15 years ago or 15 years from now.",
      "Much of her upcoming album was shaped by the two years she spent writing it, a period filled with \u201ca lot of living.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have the freedom to dream bigger than I have felt like I was allowed to in a long while,\u201d James says.",
      "Going forward, James hopes to spend as much time on the road as possible. \u201cI want to tour forever,\u201d she says. \u201cSo come hang.\u201d",
      "In other words \u2014 we're all in group 7 now."

      "Michael Bolton is in \u201cvery good spirits and very good health\u201d two years after being diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, the singer\u2019s daughters shared in a health update.",
      "\u201cHe has a lot of challenges, and we do have great days and some tough days, but in general, he\u2019s very strong. His mobility and cognition have been terrific. So, we\u2019re in a really good place right now,\u201d Isa Bolton, 50, told the AARP in an interview that was published on Dec. 19.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s generally in a really good mood and just like excited for the day,\u201d added Taryn Bolton, 46, in a video accompanying the article.",
      "Michael Bolton learned that he had glioblastoma in December 2023 after undergoing emergency surgery to remove a brain tumor. He had a second brain surgery in January 2024 to treat an infection, then received radiation and chemotherapy.",
      "The Grammy Award-winning singer, who is now 72, told the AARP via email that he\u2019s \u201cfeeling deeply grateful,\u201d but added that \u201cthis past year has tested me in ways I never imagined.\u201d",
      "His daughters called the diagnosis \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "What Illness Is Michael Bolton Suffering From?",
      "Bolton has glioblastoma, the most common and deadliest type of brain cancer, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. The median survival is nine months from diagnosis, with only 7% of glioblastoma patients living more than five years, it notes.",
      "The cancer is aggressive and difficult to treat because it grows tentacles into the brain rather than forming a solid mass. There is no cure. Uche Ojeh, the husband of TODAY co-host Sheinelle Jones, died of glioblastoma in May 2025. He was 45.",
      "Glioblastoma symptoms include persistent headaches, double vision, changes in mood, memory problems and coordination issues.",
      "One of Bolton\u2019s warning signs was a fall. The emergency brain surgery that followed left him with a \u201csignificant personality change,\u201d alarming his grandchildren, though he\u2019s mostly back to being himself, Isa Bolton said. His treatment includes yoga and physical therapy.",
      "The singer\u2019s three adult daughters \u2014 from his marriage to ex-wife  Maureen McGuire \u2014 have become his caregivers.",
      "Taryn Bolton lives with him full-time in his home in Westport, Connecticut. Isa Bolton is there three days a week, while Holly Bolton, 48, flies in one week each month. Caregiving can leave a person burnt out, sad and lonely, Taryn Bolton said, advising the millions of others in the same situation to take time to take care of themselves, too.",
      "Is Michael Bolton Still Performing?",
      "The singer is no longer performing, but the family has grown closer since Bolton \u2014 who is known for hits such as \u201cSoul Provider\u201d and spent decades traveling the world on concert tours \u2014 was forced to slow down due to his health issues.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been home for two years, recovering,\u201d Isa Bolton told the AARP. \u201cHe\u2019s with one of his children or multiple children and grandchildren for all of his meals. We probably had more meals with him in two years than we have had our entire [lives].\u201d",
      "Bolton said his daughters help him stay centered.",
      "\u201cThey remind me of who I am and what\u2019s worth fighting for,\u201d he told the AARP via email.",
      "The singer also thanked his fans for their messages and prayers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how a few words from someone you\u2019ve never met can lift your spirit and steady your steps. It reminds me that we\u2019re all connected, and none of us walk through life\u2019s challenges alone,\u201d he wrote."

      "When she was 20 weeks pregnant, Henry was diagnosed with spina bifida, a condition where the spine doesn\u2019t form properly, according to the Mayo Clinic. To manage the stress, Hinson would sing \u201cLong Live\u201d at the top of her lungs, and she says she'd feel Henry dancing inside her.",

      "The idea for a custom song came from Maddie Rodriguez, Henry\u2019s certified child life specialist, who formed an instant bond with him when they first met.",
      "\u201cThe first thing he said to me was, \u2018Are you a Swiftie?\u2019 which obviously I am,\u201d Rodriguez tells TODAY.com. \u201cSo it made the relationship just so natural and gave us something to talk about.\u201d",
      "When Henry\u2019s mom told the hospital staff that they\u2019d had to miss their planned at-home \u201cEras Tour\u201d documentary watch party due to his hospitalization, Rodriguez knew she had to do something special for him.",

      "It culminated in a performance of \u201cThe Life of Henry.\u201d Set to the backing track of the album\u2019s titular song, the team launched into their personalized lyrics celebrating everything that makes Henry special.",
      "\u201cWorking with him these last three weeks and getting to know who he is as Henry first, because he is Henry before a patient,\u201d Rodriguez explains. \u201cI just thought of all of his favorite things.\u201d",
      "Henry\u2019s reaction? \u201cI was in shock, like I cried and laughed,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. His favorite part of the song was \u201cwhen they talked about me liking Swig and 67.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they will ever understand the impact that that had on Henry, and on me,\u201d Hinson says. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t just offer medical care that day. It wasn\u2019t just them doing their jobs. They saw Henry.\u201d",
      "The viral performance came during a particularly challenging time for Henry, who has undergone 25 surgeries related to his condition. The week before Thanksgiving, Henry was hospitalized after going into septic shock and required surgery and time on a ventilator as his body fought infection.",
      "\u201cHis bravery, in my opinion, is unmatched,\u201d Hinson says, her voice catching with emotion. \u201cHe faces a lot of really big, scary things.\u201d",

It just makes his days inside of this hospital a little bit easier,\" she says.",
      "Henry now watches the video of the performance regularly, and his mom catches him humming his own personalized version of the song.",
      "She tells both her sons \u2014 Henry and his 15-year-old brother, Oliver\u2014 that \u201cjoy is a choice we make every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the hard times, it\u2019s especially important that we choose joy, that we look for joy, because it is what sustains us. And so for Henry, he oozes it. He literally oozes joy,\u201d she says.",
      "The viral attention has inspired Henry and his family to give back. When Hinson told Henry that the TikTok video was starting to earn money through the creator fund, \u201che didn\u2019t miss a beat and he said, \u2018Mom, I think we should donate it back to the hospital. You know, they\u2019re the reason we\u2019re getting it,\u2019\u201d she recalls.",
      "Both Henry and his brother Oliver asked their mom to create an Amazon wish list for the child life team at Riley instead of receiving gifts for themselves for the holidays this year.",
      "\u201cThey both were like, \u2018Mom, we have enough stuff,\u2019\u201d Hinson says. The public wish list includes items like Lip Smackers chapstick, which child life specialists use to coat the inside of anesthesia masks so kids smell strawberry or chocolate instead of a sterile operating room.",
      "\u201cChild life specialists often work with a very limited budget, but the work they do is so incredibly important,\u201d Hinson explains. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly grateful that the internet gets to see the work that really goes into loving children through critical illness.\u201d"

It\u2019s like this has been our lives for six years, and we\u2019ve gone through so many ups and downs together that this feels like a celebration of not only just like a fifth season, but of the sisterhood, and that\u2019s really special.\"",

He\u2019s very comfortable with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think, ultimately, it\u2019s the way he treats me. It\u2019s very clear. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons the fans are so in love with him. Because you should be. You know, he\u2019s very lovable.\u201d"

She is given a room in the attic to live in, even though the door strangely locks from the outside and has one tiny window that can't be opened.",

      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",

      "In 2023, Kelce attended one of Taylor Swift\u2019s concerts and attempted to give the singer a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it. Alas, he learned that she wasn\u2019t meeting with anyone before or after the show in an effort to conserve her voice for the concert, which lasted over three hours.",
      "Kelce had shared about his efforts on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast and admitted that he was \u201ca little butt hurt\u201d that he didn\u2019t get to meet Taylor Swift.",

And you know what, he really loves his mom.\u2019 And I went, ding, ding, ding, ding. Then I said, \u2018Now, how in the world am I going to get her to meet him?\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s really cute!\u201d Andrea Swift added.",

      "Taylor Swift did decide to give Kelce a try and after nearly two years of dating they announced their engagement in August 2025.",
      "\u201cOn our first date, he literally had to explain football as if it were, like, violent chess,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhich helps me kind of understand it. Like high-speed, angry chess. And then I just sort of became obsessed with him and therefore became obsessed with learning about football. Greatest surprise of my life.\u201d",
      "In the end, the pop star\u2019s mother also approves of her relationship.",
      "\u201cHe really is one of the happiest people I think I\u2019ve ever met, which I adore. He just brought a lot of happiness, which is I think what he does in a lot of his circles. He brings a lot of happiness to the world,\u201d she said in the doc.",
      "While reflecting on her romantic life before Kelce, Swift said she always struggled to balance her relationships with her career. However, the dynamic changed when she met Kelce.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I thought I\u2019d ever meet a guy who had that same (career) trajectory. And I realized that with this person in my life that just was the right fit for me. You can have the two passions coexist and they actually fuel each other,\u201d she said."

      "An injured, healing and angry Neytiri infiltrates the RDA\u2019s facilities to rescue Jake. She is successful thanks to the help of Spider, who broke out of his cell, and marine biologist Dr. Ian Garvin (Jemaine Clement), who is against the humans killing Tulkun.",
      "Meanwhile, the RDA has big plans to kill dozens of Tulkun, whose brains carry amrita, a substance that stops humans from aging. After meeting the Ash People earlier in the film, Quaritch goes to Varang to ask for help in defeating Jake and the other Na\u2019vi in exchange for firearms and machinery. The Ash People come in handy when the big war rages.",
      "When they get back to the Metkayina clan, Jake rallies up as many Na\u2019vi to fight and save their people and all the innocent Tulkun. In the process, many get injured and Jake and Neytiri\u2019s children \u2014 Lo\u2019ak, Kirk, Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) \u2014 as well as Spider, take matters into their own hands.",
      "During the fight, pregnant Ronal (Kate Winslet) dies, but not before delivering her baby and asking Neytiri to take care of her baby girl.",

      "Jake \u2014 who has been fighting alongside the Great Leonopteryx, the dragon-like warrior \u2014 then gets into a one-on-one battle with Quaritch on the floating islands. At one point, Spider is thrown into the middle of their fight. He slips and is at risk of falling to his death. Quaritch attempts to save him but also puts himself in danger \u2014 and Jake helps save them both. The encounter seems to draw them all to a truce.",
      "When Neytiri, her children and Tsireya (Bailey Bass) arrive to help defeat Quaritch, Jake tells them to stop. However, Quaritch jumps off the floating island and into an inferno below. It sure doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d survive that, but \u201cAvatar\u201d fans know that guy has a thousand lives.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "Jelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "Jelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion",
      "Lee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.",
      "Much of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" about someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview. \"By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I'm not telling my story anymore. I'm getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story's never been told.\"",
      "Jelly Roll: 'I was a part of the problem'",
      "Before the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Outside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Sheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon",
      "Friends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "\"I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that's not just words,\" Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I'm talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor."

      "The Kremlin fired 635 drones and 38 missiles, Ukrainian officials said, triggering air raid sirens, nationwide blackouts and prompting neighboring Poland to scramble fighter jets. At least four people were killed, including a child, with dozens more injured, regional officials said.",
      "The bombardment came hours before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia may launch \u201cmassive strikes on Christmas,\u201d saying his country was suffering a \u201cshortage of air defense systems.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A pair of deadly attacks this month, in Syria and Australia, has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group whose sudden rise to power in the Middle East and reign of terror throughout the world had appeared to crest, and then fall, during the 2010s.",
      "But for experts who study ISIS, law enforcement and intelligence officials who fight it and the growing number of victims who have been attacked or intimidated, the group has long been more down than out \u2013 a diminished threat, but a threat nonetheless.",
      "\u201cThey never went away,\u201d said Aaron Zelin, an expert on the group and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe nature of the threat just changed and the nature of the way they organized themselves changed. But what\u2019s animated the Islamic State has never changed.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, a member of Syria\u2019s security forces shot dead three Americans -- two soldiers and an interpreter -- near the city of Palmyra. The Islamic State didn\u2019t claim responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Syrian governments both blamed the terrorist group.",
      "The U.S. military launched strikes against Islamic State infrastructure and weapons sites in Syria in retaliation for the attack, officials said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\u201d President Donald Trump  said Friday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In Sydney, two men opened fire on a Hanukkah gathering at  Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing at least 15 people. Both men were shot by police. One man died; the other, the man\u2019s son, survived and has been charged in the attack. Islamic State social media accounts traditionally linked to the group praised the attack but did not officially claim responsibility, referring to it  in an official publication as \"Sydney's pride.\" The two suspects were found with Islamic State flags and literature.",
      "While the two incidents were notable for their geographic spread, the identities of those killed and a perception that the Islamic State had faded from global headlines, experts say they were exceptions that belie a measurable metric: ISIS is getting weaker, and arrests and attacks have been declining globally.",
      "\u201cThere will always be some space for attacks here and there. But the trajectory is that ISIS is still on the decline,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cAnyone who has a grievance and finds a network can basically attack, and in many cases the central ISIS leaders don\u2019t know it happens until it happens, and then they claim it.\u201d",
      "The group has claimed 1,100 attacks so far in 2025, he said, down from a high of 3,460 in 2019.",
      "There have been 383 ISIS-related arrests worldwide so far in 2025, Zelin said, citing the Washington Institute\u2019s Islamic State Select Worldwide Activity Map, an initiative he leads. Reporting from police sources found 531 such arrests last year, Zelin said, the vast majority of which occurred in active war zones such as Iraq and Syria.",
      "One thing the recent attacks showcase is a strategy that has made the Islamic State effective in the past: its big-tent approach to operations and ideology that allow \u201clone-wolf\u201d actors to affiliate themselves with ISIS with almost no vetting or coordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of and more of the hallmarks of ISIS-related activity that date back 10 years ago,\u201d Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, told NBC News. \u201cThe do-it-yourself model was professionalized and has been really deployed around the world by ISIS, inspiring dozens of people to carry out attacks in their name.\u201d",
      "The Islamic State emerged from the ferment of Syria\u2019s civil war in the early 2010s, when Syria\u2019s porous borders and surfeit of Islamist fighters offered fertile recruiting ground for all manner of jihadi groups. But ISIS  distinguished itself by forming a self-governing state encompassing parts of Syria and Iraq that promised a return to the political expansionism of early Islam.",
      "Though defeated, that \u201ccaliphate\u201d has remained a central part of the Islamic State\u2019s message, even as the group has shifted its focus more toward terrorism than nation-building.",
      "The two suspects in the Bondi Beach shooting are known to have visited the Philippines before the attack. If investigators find that the two men underwent ISIS commando training in southern Mindanao island, that could point to a level of centralized coordination that investigators haven\u2019t seen from ISIS in years.",
      "The group\u2019s activities over the past year have also shown an enduring, if dampened, public appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, Polish authorities said they had arrested a teenager who they said had sought contact with the group and whom they suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market.",
      "In Michigan in October, two men were charged with plotting a mass shooting over Halloween weekend.",
      "And almost a year ago, an ISIS-inspired American Muslim killed 14 people by driving a truck into New Year\u2019s revelers in New Orleans.",
      "The Islamic State has still been unable to reconstitute its so-called caliphate, a vast Islamist emirate the group ruled across parts of Iraq and Syria until it was finally destroyed in 2019. In both countries, Islamic State attacks reached historic lows in the past year.",
      "Where the group has made strides and managed to constitute some territory is in the Sahel region of northwest sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 countries like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "The Islamic State\u2019s presence in the remote, arid and sparsely populated parts of Africa may still feel more like merely surviving than thriving to the group\u2019s members and potential recruits.",
      "\u201cEven though they\u2019re active in several African countries, it doesn\u2019t have the same kind of ideological reverence because there is so much history in the Arab world related to Islam,\u201d said Zelin.",
      "And while the Sydney terror attack was lethally successful, many of the Islamic State\u2019s attacks have been thwarted by law enforcement as multinational counterterrorism sharing has grown far stronger.",
      "While observers have said it\u2019s too early to say the recent attacks amount to a resurgence of the group, two relatively recent changes could help revive its fortunes. The fall of Bashar al Assad\u2019s regime in Syria a year ago revived the country\u2019s chaos, offering a wider opening for Islamic State.",
      "When Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa \u2014 himself a former Islamist militant who once led a like-minded Al Qaeda offshoot group \u2014 joined the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS last month, it painted a target on the Syrian government\u2019s back.",
      "Even before that, an Islamic State-claimed attack on a church in Damascus that killed at least 25 people in June once again jolted Syrian authorities\u2019 attention to Islamic State\u2019s threat.",
      "Meanwhile, the group\u2019s messaging has exploited Israel\u2019s highly lethal war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip as a rallying cry for attacks against the West. Palestinian health officials say over 70,000 people have been killed in the war.",
      "\u201cI think the temperature has been turned up by the conflict in Gaza over the past two years,\u201d said Colin P. Clarke, the executive director of the Soufan Center, a New York-based security think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s brought in a larger swath of people who are now kind of consuming information that leads them pretty quickly through social media algorithms to extreme content.\u201d",
      "As much of the world gathers for the end-of-year religious holidays,  Islamic State commandos \u2014 whether self-annointed or directed by its leadership \u2014 are taking notice as well.",
      "The group has targeted religious festivities in the past, and analysts warned that another spectacular assault against Christian, Jewish or Muslim targets could give the Islamic State the publicity boost it needs for a more deadly and influential 2026.",
      "\u201cThese are big times when they might try to do stuff,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cIf they can do stuff again quickly, that would be monumental for them, because they haven\u2019t been able to do stuff like that in years.\u201d"

Enrolled at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious engineering schools, Neves Valente graduated at the top of his class, seemingly poised for a bright future.",
      "Now, Neves Valente is dead at age 48, suspected of committing two shocking acts of violence \u2014 and authorities in both the United States and Portugal are looking for a motive that could explain his actions.",
      "Officials believe Neves Valente was behind a mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine other people on Saturday at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is also suspected of fatally shooting 47-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro at Loureiro\u2019s home in the Boston suburb of Brookline on Monday.",
      "The shootings gripped residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts as days passed without anyone in custody. Then on Thursday, authorities announced they had closed in on a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, where they found Neves Valente\u2019s body, who appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Little is known about how he chose his targets, though Neves Valente has past connections to Brown and to Loureiro.",
      "A Providence police affidavit says that Neves Valente came to the U.S. to attend Brown University from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program. He requested a leave of absence from the school in 2001, and ultimately withdrew in 2003, the affidavit said.",
      "Neves Valente did not obtain a degree during his time there, Brown\u2019s president said in an email, and he did not have a current affiliation with the university. The email said that during his three semesters at Brown, Neves Valente most likely would have spent time in Barus & Holley, the building where Saturday\u2019s massacre occurred.",
      "Scott Watson told NBC News that he attended Brown with Neves Valente and had been his only friend there. He said Neves Valente was socially awkward and would often complain about Brown.",
      "\u201cHe would say the classes were too easy \u2014 honestly, for him they were,\u201d Watson wrote in an email. \u201cHe already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe could be kind and gentle, though he often became frustrated \u2014 sometimes angry \u2014 about courses, professors, and living conditions,\u201d Watson wrote.",
      "Watson recalled a conflict that Neves Valente had with another student whom he said Neves Valente would refer to as a \"slave\" because the student was from Brazil.",
      "\"I had to break up a fight once,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to that time, both Neves Valente and Loureiro, the MIT professor, attended the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, according to the school, which said that they were enrolled from 1995 to 2000 in the undergraduate program in technological physics engineering. Rog\u00e9rio Cola\u00e7o, the president of Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso that Neves Valente graduated with a final average grade of 19 out of 20 \u2014 an exceptionally high score, particularly given how rigorous the university is.",
      "Even before starting college, Neves Valente had made a strong impression academically. He represented Portugal at the 1995 International Physics Olympiad for secondary school students, in Canberra, Australia, a news clip from the science publication Gazeta da F\u00edsica shows.",
      "Yet Neves Valente seemed to have left little imprint on those he studied with.",
      "\u201cMost classmates have no memory of Cl\u00e1udio Valente, other than the fact that he was the top student in the program that year,\u201d Cola\u00e7o told Expresso.",
      "Loureiro, meanwhile, was a researcher at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico's plasmas and nuclear fusion unit and was described in a statement from the school as a \"brilliant colleague.\"",
      "\"His friends and colleagues at IPFN and at T\u00e9cnico, some of whom continued to collaborate with Nuno to this day, are deeply distressed by his premature passing,\" the statement said. \"We remember a brilliant colleague, with whom it was a scientific and personal pleasure to collaborate.\"",
      "Alex Schekochihin, a longtime friend and colleague of Loureiro's, said in an email that it was difficult to find anyone who did not like Loureiro.",
      "\"He was a fantastic physicist, a very effective leader with a clear vision and sophisticated sense of strategy, and an amazing human being,\" he wrote.",
      "What Neves Valente accomplished personally or professionally after graduation is not as clear.",
      "Loureiro was a widely known figure \"to anyone who follows the field,\u201d said Carlos Fiolhais, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of Coimbra. \"Valente was a physicist by training, not a researcher, with no known published articles. ... This is aberrant. It is deeply disturbing for the scientific community.\u201d",
      "The Providence police affidavit said that Neves Valente obtained legal permanent resident status in 2017. Public records show he lived in Las Vegas that year and, more recently, appeared to reside in Miami. He had rented a hotel room in Boston twice in late November, an FBI agent wrote in a separate affidavit.",
      "A tipster on the chat forum Reddit led authorities to track down Neves Valente after the shootings. The Portuguese Criminal Police, Portugal\u2019s investigative force, said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation.",
      "The Brown University students killed in Saturday\u2019s attack were identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook.

      "In a video shared by the Prisoners for Palestine protest group, Thunberg, 22, can be seen holding a sign reading \u201cI support the Palestine Action prisoners. I oppose genocide.\u201d",
      "Palestine Action, a United Kingdom-based direct action protest group, was classified as a terrorist organization by the British government in July, after causing millions of dollars worth of damage to defense firms.",
      "Since the ban, hundreds of people have been arrested nationwide for taking part in protests against that ban, which has since been challenged at the High Court in London.",
      "In a video shared by Prisoners for Palestine, the group said it targeted the central London offices of Aspen Insurance because it provides services to the Israeli-linked defense firm Elbit Systems.",
      "Two activists sprayed red paint over the front of the building before police arrived and made arrests.",
      "Asked about Thunberg's arrest by NBC News, the City of London Police said in a statement that \u201chammers and red paint were used to damage a building on Fenchurch Street.\u201d",
      "\u201cA man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. They glued themselves nearby and specialist officers are working to release them, and bring them into police custody,\u201d it added.",
      "\u201cA little while later, a 22-year-old woman also attended the scene. She has been arrested for displaying an item (in this case a placard) in support of a proscribed organization (in this case Palestine Action) contrary to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.\u201d",
      "British police never release the names of those arrested. It is only once people have been charged that their names are made public.",
      "Last year, Thunberg was cleared of a public order offense in Britain as a judge ruled police had no power to arrest her and others at a protest in London the year before.",
      "But Thunberg has been vocal in her support for the people of the Gaza Strip and has been detained by Israeli authorities while sailing on boats trying to deliver a symbolic shipments of aid to the Palestinian enclave by sea.",
      "Gaza has been under an Israeli naval blockade since 2007, when Hamas took power.",
      "Thunberg said the missions were essential amid global silence on Israel\u2019s military action in Gaza, much of which was reduced to rubble during two years of war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Israeli forces have killed more than 70,000 Palestinians since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led terror attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage."

We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera,\" she added, according to a transcript of her remarks shared with NBC News.",
      "\"Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else. That's my north star and I hope it's yours, too,\" Weiss said in closing.",

      "In seeking federal approval of the merger with Paramount, Skydance vowed to embrace \"diverse viewpoints\" and represent \"the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.\" He also pledged to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and install an ombudsman at CBS News.",
      "Ellison is separately making a hostile bid to acquire the media giant Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN. Warner Bros. Discovery has already accepted an offer from Netflix in a deal valued at $82.7 billion. Both transactions would require approval from federal regulators.",
      "Trump has close ties to Ellison's father, billionaire technology mogul Larry Ellison, though in recent weeks he has publicly expressed frustration with the direction of \"60 Minutes\" under Paramount's new corporate leadership.",
      "\"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" Trump said Dec. 16 on Truth Social. \"If they are friends, I\u2019d hate to see my enemies!\"",

      "David Ossip, the president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, told the crowd: \"Like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained. We have landed up in a dark place.\"",
      "But he pointed to the heroism of Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Syrian Australian fruit shop owner who disarmed one of the shooters, adding that \"a single act of courage, a single flame of hope, can give us direction and point the path forward.\"",
      "Ossip read a message to the crowd from al-Ahmed, who is recovering in the hospital from multiple gunshot wounds. In his message, al-Ahmed said: \"The Lord is close to the broken-hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters.\"",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was at the memorial, as was Governor-General Sam Mostyn, King Charles' representative in Australia. Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard was photographed embracing mourners in the crowd.",
      "The shooting has left Australians across the country reeling, with tributes accompanied by a reckoning over the government\u2019s response to growing antisemitism and the availability of guns in the country.",
      "Albanese was booed as he arrived Sunday night. Leaders in Australia\u2019s Jewish community and some of the victims\u2019 families have blamed the Australian government for missing the signs of growing antisemitism in the wake of the war between Hamas and Israel that erupted in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on an Israeli music festival and accused it of not doing enough to protect the country\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "On Sunday, Albanese commissioned a review of Australia\u2019s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to examine whether they have the \u201cright powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe\u201d in the wake of the attack.",
      "\u201cThe ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,\u201d his statement said. \u201cOur security agencies must be in the best position to respond.\u201d The review is to be completed by April, he said.",
      "State authorities in New South Wales have moved to tighten restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests and hate speech, with NSW Premier Chris Minns saying protests were \"unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain.\"",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, the surviving suspect, was charged with 59 offenses Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50.",
      "Two \u201chomemade\u201d Islamic State flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police said last week, adding that the pair traveled last month to the Philippines \u2014 seen in the past as a hot spot for Islamic extremists.",
      "In its weekly Al-Naba magazine bulletin, the Islamic State praised the attack, describing it as a \u201csource of pride,\u201d though it did not directly claim responsibility.",
      "Naveed Akram came to the attention of Australia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in 2019, Albanese said last week, and he was probed for six months over his alleged extremist associations, but it was determined that he posed no threat.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in Britain and Australia are tightening restrictions on pro-Palestinians protests in response to the Islamic State-inspired Bondi Beach massacre targeting a Jewish gathering that killed 15 people.",
      "In New South Wales, the Australian state where the deadly attack on a Hanukkah celebration took place, police will be granted expanded powers to shut down unauthorized protests, while tougher hate speech laws will be introduced, including a proposed ban on the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada.\u201d",
      "The move comes shortly after U.K. police arrested two people in London on racially aggravated public order charges for allegedly shouting slogans invoking \u201cintifada\u201d at a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",
      "Supporters say the term \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d which has been used for years at pro-Palestinian protests worldwide, refers to international solidarity against Israeli occupation.",
      "Israeli officials and some Jewish organizations, however, argue the term carries an inherent call to violence against Israel and that it functions as antisemitic incitement, a dispute that has increasingly led to policing decisions.",
      "NSW Premier Chris Minns said Thursday that the \u201cimplications\u201d of pro-Palestinian rallies could be seen in the Bondi attack and, after authorities designated the shooting a terrorist event, he has introduced reforms that would give his government powers to shut down unauthorized protests for three months.",
      "\u201cWhen you see people marching and showing violent bloody images, images of death and destruction, it\u2019s unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain,\u201d he said.",
      "Minns on Saturday announced further reforms to hate speech laws that would ban the \"globalize the intifada\" chant alongside other \u201chateful comments and statements,\u201d as well as \u201cterrorist symbols such as the ISIS flags.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday officers would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d directly citing the context of the attack. A rabbi and a Holocaust survivor were among those killed in the Sydney terror attack, which officials said was intended to directly target the Jewish community.",
      "In a joint statement after the attack, London and Manchester's law enforcement agencies said: \u201cViolent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\u201d",
      "The British police forces also referenced an attack at a synagogue in Manchester earlier this year, where two people were killed on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.",
      "Hundreds of people, many of them elderly, according to British Home Office data, have already been arrested at protests in recent months across the U.K. for showing support for Palestine Action, a group that was banned under British terrorism laws after staging actions targeting military facilities and defense firms. The British government said, without providing evidence, that the group had shown willingness \"to use violence in pursuit of its cause.\"",
      "While major Jewish groups have welcomed last week's changes and proposals in the U.K. and Australia, some analysts and opponents of the new measures warn that governments are responding to security fears by collapsing political speech into criminal conduct.",
      "Index on Censorship, a U.K.-based organization advocating for free expression, said police and prosecutors will need to demonstrate that the words \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d are \u201charmful in and of themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere meaning is genuinely ambiguous, we always argue that the criminal law should tread carefully,\u201d it said in a statement Friday.",
      "Marji Mansfield, 69, a retired financial consultant and grandmother of seven, was carried away in handcuffs by police officers at demonstrations in July and November in London, and faces terrorism charges for expressing support for Palestine Action.",
      "She said she hasn't heard 'globalize the intifada' chanted at rallies, but denied the slogan was an incitement to violence, calling it \"a call for liberation\" amid Israel's ongoing occupation of Gaza.",
      "\"It seems bizarre that our government and the government in Australia are seeking to criminalize words that are saying, 'stop these illegal international crimes against humanity',\" she told NBC News.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, warned in July that some measures in the U.K. limiting pro-Palestinian protests appear \"at odds with the U.K.\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\"",
      "Freedom of expression \u201chas always been vital, but it\u2019s never been absolute,\" said Mark Stephens, co-chair of the International Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Institute. \"We've always drawn a line at incitement to violence, and so that principle has to adapt in more volatile climates.\"",
      "The difficulty authorities face, Stephens told NBC News, is that they are taking slogans and criminalizing them \"on the grounds that it threatens public safety and the state has a duty to act, but that is an area where reasonable people can and do differ.\"",
      "From a police perspective \"it's becoming a bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole,\" he added. \"If you can't say 'globalize the intifada,' someone will come up with something else which isn't illegal, and that becomes the new phrase du jour.\"",
      "In Australia, the additional legislation on protests has also sparked debate over how far authorities should go in policing political expression.",
      "\u201cFor two years, people have paraded in our streets and universities calling for the intifada to be globalized, a catchphrase which means kill Jews wherever you find them,\" David Ossip, the president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said last week.",
      "Some Jewish groups have opposed the move. The Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \"Palestinian freedom,\" said Thursday in a statement that \"policy which points towards universities, the protest movement and migration as the problem will only lead to more demonization.\"",
      "Australian authorities charged the surviving suspect in the Bondi Beach shooting with 59 offenses on Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder.",
      "Naveed Akram, 24, was charged after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50."

Both were members of the Iowa National Guard. Ayad Mansoor Sakat, of Macomb, Michigan, a U.S. civilian working as an interpreter, was also killed.",
      "The shooting that took place near the historic city of Palmyra also wounded three U.S. personnel and members of Syria\u2019s security forces, before the gunman was killed. The assailant had joined Syria\u2019s internal security forces as a base security guard two months ago and recently was reassigned because of suspicions that he might be affiliated with ISIS, Interior Ministry spokesperson Nour al-Din al-Baba has said."

      "In his phone interview, Trump said \"I don't discuss it\" when he is asked whether he rules out the possibility that such actions could lead to war.",
      "But when he was pressed, he confirmed it was a possibility and said there will be additional seizures of oil tankers. Asked for a timeline, Trump replied: \"It depends. If they\u2019re foolish enough to be sailing along, they\u2019ll be sailing along back into one of our harbors.\"",

      "\"He knows exactly what I want,\" Trump replied. \"He knows better than anybody.\"",
      "Trump's admission that he's not ruling out a war with Venezuela is significant. He has long tried to distinguish himself from the hawkish wing of the Republican Party, and in 2024, he campaigned on being able to keep the U.S. out of foreign conflicts.",

      "For the second year in a row, North Korea\u2019s vast cryptocurrency hacking operation has broken its own record, stealing $2.02 billion in 2025, new research says.",
      "A report published Thursday by the blockchain watchdog company Chainalysis found that North Korea broke its own record of $1.3 billion in hacked and stolen crypto like bitcoin and ethereum. That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",
      "A significant chunk of that comes from the hack of the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit this year. The hackers \u2014 who worked for North Korea\u2019s elite government hacking squad, according to the U.S. Secret Service \u2014 stole around $1.5 billion, mostly in ethereum, in February, Bybit\u2019s CEO said.",

      "Part of the theft is most likely due to the increasingly common phenomenon of North Korean hackers\u2019 fraudulently obtaining remote technical jobs with international companies, the report said. That access can put them in positions to give their hacker colleagues a foothold to steal cryptocurrency keys and wire crypto to Pyongyang.",
      "There are scattered incidents of other countries\u2019 professional hackers\u2019 stealing large amounts of money. The Secret Service previously linked Chinese government hackers to an operation that stole U.S. Covid relief benefits, and the U.S. and U.K. governments have accused some financially motivated Russian cybercriminals of ties to the Kremlin.",

      "Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets, or accounts that can be accessed with private keys, and it remains the case that if hackers gain control of an account, they can quickly wire it to a different wallet that they own.

      "But the apology was not enough to prevent her being stripped of her title by the Miss Finland organization Saturday. In a statement on Instagram, it said the content she published was \u201coffensive, harmful and completely against the values\u201d of the pageant.",
      "\u201cThe events of recent days have caused deep hurt, disappointment, and concern both in Finland and internationally,\u201d it added.",
      "Dzafce did not immediately respond to a request for further comment Thursday.",
      "The decision angered several members in the Finns Party, including lawmakers Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, and a Finnish European Parliament member, Sebastian Tynkkynen, all of whom shared similar images online in solidarity with Dzafce.",
      "NBC News has asked all three parliamentarians for comment.",
      "Eerola has apologized, telling the Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun on Monday that he was \u201cdeeply sorry that my photo caused offense to Asian people.\u201d",
      "The Finns Party plans to discuss the matter at a weekly meeting Thursday, according to the Finnish national broadcaster Yle.",
      "The scandal is the latest incident linked to this year's turbulent Miss Universe contest hosted in Thailand, where organizers have faced walkouts and accusations of rigging."
