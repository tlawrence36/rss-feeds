      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Charli xcx plays herself in \u201cThe Moment,\u201d a meta mockumentary about the end of Brat summer and grappling with otherworldly success.",
      "\u201cI was just really interested in telling this story about expectation,\u201d Charli xcx told The Associated Press the day after \u201cThe Moment\u201d debuted at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "The 33-year-old pop star from Essex has been in the music industry since she was 16, with a career trajectory that she described as anything but straight forward. Then, in 2024, it hit a crescendo with her sixth studio album, \u201cBrat,\u201d which became a pop culture phenomenon. Finally, she said, she felt understood for a moment. And then, just as quickly, it changed.",
      "\u201cThere was this sort of, kind of, you know, persona that people really associated me with and then there were a lot of expectations put on me as a person, as an artist, of who I was then supposed to be. And I didn\u2019t fit into that sort of narrative,\u201d she said. \u201cI had got to this place where I was finally feeling so understood. Then I was like not understood again.\u201d",
      "Making something immensely popular and resonant can be a double-edged sword for an artist working in a business that would sometimes rather milk the \u201csure thing\u201d forever than let someone evolve and move on. She found herself wanting to grapple with that tension, that existential conundrum that she\u2019d experienced.",
      "A straightforward documentary didn\u2019t seem like right approach, so she and Aidan Zamiri, the 30-year-old Scottish photographer and music video director, got to work on something else, something that felt truer to them. \u201cThe Moment\u201d is a little \u201cThis is Spinal Tap,\u201d a little \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d a little meta, with the likes of Kylie Jenner and Rachel Sennott playing themselves, a little funny and a little wild. It\u2019s heightened, but also true.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t lie, there are definitely some crossovers,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the choices that Charli in the film makes, but I\u2019ve definitely, like, come close to it. \u2026 It was a very accurate depiction of what I\u2019ve experienced in the music industry.\u201d",
      "One of the buzziest titles in a starry program, the A24 film will be in theaters faster than most: It opens in New York and Los Angeles on Jan. 30 and expands wide on Feb. 6.",
      "In \u201cThe Moment,\u201d Charli xcx is under pressure as Brat summer comes to an end, having to stage a concert film with Amazon, with a sleazy director not of her choosing played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, promote a Brat credit card, and fall in line with what music executives want from her. She\u2019s also not sleeping and getting increasingly frazzled about everything.",
      "Zamiri, who directed her \u201c360\u201d music video and has become one of her best friends, was excited by the challenge and to direct his first feature film. He also understood intrinsically what she was going through.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this battle of expectations and of people wanting one thing from you and you feeling this pressure too, to stick with it, to keep providing that one thing for fear that maybe that attention, that excitement about you will falter if the next thing they don\u2019t love,\u201d Zamiri said. \u201cI love the process of making stuff. But part of it, which is often really exciting but also weird, is the sharing with the world because then it\u2019s just no longer yours anymore \u2026 it becomes its own thing which I think we saw happen in real-time with Brat.\u201d",
      "As with the \u201cBrat\u201d album and everything she does, Charli xcx has been intimately involved in the marketing and promotion of the movie too.",

      "There\u2019s a palpable energy around \u201cThe Moment\u201d as it approaches its theatrical release.

The Amazon MGM sci-fi thriller \u201cMercy\u201d dethroned \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d from the No. 1 spot with $11.2 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Some 250 theaters were forced to close, from Texas to Maine, according to data firm Comsore. More than 140 million Americans were under winter storm warnings, depressing moviegoing.",
      "But the weekend was never going to be a blockbuster one, anyway. \u201cMercy,\u201d a $60 million thriller starring Chris Pratt as a man in a near-future standing trial before an AI judge, was the top new release. It arrived with withering reviews (20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an equally poor reception (a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore) from audiences.",
      "That was still enough to finally dislodge James Cameron's third Pandora epic from its monthlong perch atop the box office. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d slid to second place with $7 million. While The Walt Disney Co. release is starting to peter out domestically, it remains a top draw overseas. It took in $28.1 million internationally in its sixth weekend.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d isn't going to come close to the box-office heights of the previous two \u201cAvatar\u201d movies. The 2009 original grossed $2.9 billion and the 2022 sequel, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d tapped out at $2.3 billion. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has now cleared $1 billion internationally, but its domestic haul ($378.5 million) is well off the pace of the other two films.",
      "The \u201cOscar bump\u201d that films once saw following nomination is largely a thing of the past. The lead movies in Thursday's nominations \u2014 \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d \u2014 long ago completed their theatrical runs. But a handful of nominees saw strong business.",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d nominated for eight Oscars including best picture, collected $2 million in its first weekend of wide release.

It's up to $17.6 million domestically and $42.1 million worldwide.",
      "Josh Safdie's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d nominated for nine Oscars, earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend of release. The A24 title, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, this week cross $100 million globally. It's made $86.2 million domestically thus far.",
      "But newer releases struggled. \u201cReturn to Silent Hill,\u201d the third installment in a horror series kick-started with 2006's \u201cSilent Hill,\u201d opened with $3.2 million. Though Sony released the 2006 film and Open Road distributed the 2012 follow up, the low-budget \u201cReturn to Silent Hill\u201d was put out by Iconic Events.",
      "In its second week of release, \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d dropped swiftly. The Sony release, directed by Nia DaCosta, opened last week to a disappointing $13.3 million in sales despite good reviews. But its second weekend was even worse, dropping 71% with $3.6 million.",
      "Other new releases flopped. Roadside Attractions' \u201cH Is For Hawk,\u201d starring Claire Foy, took in just $150,000 from 472 theaters. Sony's \u201cClika,\u201d about a migrant worker with music aspirations, managed only $1.2 million in 522 locations.",

      "Redford, who died in September at age 89, established the festival and development programs for filmmakers in the Utah mountains as a haven for independent storytelling far from the pressures of Hollywood.

      "Boulder emerged victorious from a yearlong search in which numerous U.S. cities vied to host the nation\u2019s premier independent film festival. Sundance organizers decided to search for a new home because they said the festival had outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map and developed an air of exclusivity that took focus away from the films.",
      "Some film professionals and volunteers said they were willing to give Boulder a try but worried Sundance could lose its identity outside its longtime home.",
      "Lauren Garcia, who has come from Seattle to volunteer at Sundance for the past six years, said curiosity may lead her to Boulder for future festivals. She described feeling a sadness lingering over the final Utah festival and wondered if Redford's death means it's time for Sundance to close this chapter.",

      "\u201cIt was like what a view, it\u2019s incredible, what a beautiful day,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cIt was very windy, so I was like, don\u2019t fall off the spire. I was trying to balance nicely. But it was, what an incredible position, what a beautiful way to see Taipei.\u201d",
      "Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands.",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors of the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.",
      "Honnold's free solo climb of the iconic building in Taiwan's capital city was broadcast live on Netflix with a 10-second delay. The ascent, originally scheduled for Saturday, was delayed for 24 hours due to rain.",
      "Having a cheering crowd was unusual and a bit unnerving at first for Honnold, whose climbs are usually in remote areas.",

I mean basically it just makes the whole experience feel almost more festive, all these nice people are out supporting me and having a good time.\u201d",
      "The climb drew both excitement and concern over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast.",
      "Honnold isn't the first climber to ascend Taipei 101, but he is the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004 as part of the grand opening of what was then the world\u2019s tallest building.",

Three of the five best director nominees at this year's Academy Awards \u2014 Paul Thomas Anderson, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and Ryan Coogler \u2014 came up through the labs.",
      "Zhao, whose film \u201cHamnet\u201d was nominated this week for eight Oscars, credited the screenwriting lab with jump-starting her career in 2012. Under the mentorship of Redford and program director Michelle Satter, she said she learned to trust her own vision and gained an invaluable community of creatives.",

      "\u201cI remember once seeing him walk some of the other fellows from the directors lab, and he just looked so full of love and pride for us, for what he built,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cAnd it was just very clear to me in that moment the depth to which he cared about this place and all of us.\u201d",
      "Sundance Film Festival regular Ethan Hawke recounted his first audition in front of Redford for the 1992 period drama \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d After forgoing sleep to prepare a lengthy monologue, Hawke said Redford pulled him aside to say he was too young for the part but would undoubtedly have a wonderful career.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film about his vision for saving the planet, 16 years after he wrote a book on the subject",
      "LONDON -- Can it be that, like many baby boomers, King Charles III feels misunderstood?",
      "That might sound like a strange question for a man with his own public relations team and easy access to any journalist in the realm. But 16 years after he wrote a book explaining his vision for saving the planet, the king has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film spelling out that philosophy.",
      "The documentary delves into Charles\u2019 concept of \u201charmony,\u201d the idea that restoring the balance between the human and natural worlds is crucial to combatting global warming and many other major problems facing humanity.",
      "Along the way, the king also confronts his critics, who have lampooned him as a dilettante flitting aimlessly from one cause to another with no rhyme or reason. Charles believes that climate change, urban planning, sustainable agriculture, traditional crafts and fostering understanding between religions \u2014 causes to which he has devoted much of his adult life \u2014 are inter-related issues that must be dealt with to create more liveable communities.",
      "\u201cI think we need to follow harmony if we are going to ensure that this planet can support so many,\u2019\u2019 he said in a trailer for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s anywhere else.\u2019\u2019",
      "To help explain these ideas, experts including Tony Juniper, the former head of Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Emily Shuckburgh, a University of Cambridge climate scientist, appear with Charles in \u201cFinding Harmony: A King\u2019s Vision,\u201d available on Amazon from Feb. 6. The narrator is Kate Winslet.",
      "The king wants people to recognize that humans are as much a part of the natural world as the birds and the trees, something that can be obscured as we rush to work in air-conditioned offices, then drive to the supermarket to buy food wrapped in plastic, Juniper told The Associated Press.",
      "The \u201ccycles and loops\u201d of nature are still what govern human society, Juniper said, and reconnecting with that is critical as we confront global warming, soil erosion, ocean plastics and the chemicals building up in our food chains.",
      "\u201cAll of that is reversible, all of that fixable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require more of us to understand that we are not outside nature, we are in it.\u201d",
      "Juniper believes Charles is uniquely qualified to deliver this message because he has been campaigning on these issues for decades and continues to do so even as other world leaders shun environmental protection.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one person in the world who is literally a globally recognized figure, who has authenticity derived from an incredible track record on these subjects, it is King Charles III,\u201d Juniper said.",
      "Charles addressed the idea of restoring balance in the natural world in his 2010 book \u201cHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,\u201d written with Juniper and Ian Skelly, a former BBC presenter.",
      "So why return to the subject now?",
      "Part of it may be the hope of reaching a new audience through a streaming service with global reach. Prince William, Charles\u2019 heir, ventured into the same space last year when he revealed his plans for the monarchy on comedian Eugene Levy\u2019s Apple TV show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "But the king also wants to shift the focus back to an issue he hopes will define his legacy after two years in which the media, and the public, were distracted by other matters, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u201d",
      "First there was Charles\u2019 cancer diagnosis, which forced him to step away from public duties for several months in early 2024 and raised nagging questions about his health.

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival is in full swing, with Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx movies premiering back-to-back at the storied Eccles Theatre Friday evening in Park City, Utah. Considered some of the hottest tickets at the festival, the waitlists are already long, and the lines will surely be longer.",
      "First up is \u201cJosephine,\u201d writer-director Beth De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s raw drama about an 8-year-old girl (Mason Reeves) whose life and sense of safety is upended after she witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Gemma Chan play the parents who are unsure how to help her navigate these new emotions and fears. The film, which is part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition, is based on De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s own experience of seeing something scarring at that age.",
      "The next film, Gregg Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d will bring a distinct change in tone to the Eccles. It\u2019s the story of a college graduate in his early 20s (played by Cooper Hoffman ) who gets his first job as a kind of intern/assistant to a renowned art world provocateur named Erika Tracy (Wilde), who Arkai described as \u201cbold, daring and very controversial,\u201d a cross between Robert Mapplethorpe and Madonna.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the story of their affairs and the impact it has on this kid\u2019s life and how it kind of turns his whole world upside down,\u201d Araki told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it\u2019s sexy. And it\u2019s a ride.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a film that Araki has been working on for over 10 years, as it evolved from a comic \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a female intern to what it is now.",
      "\u201cAfter #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, all the stuff that was going on, it was literally like, I don\u2019t really want to see a woman getting dragged around by the hair,\u201d Araki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seed that kind of patriarchal dynamic, even if it\u2019s consensual.\u201d",
      "Flipping the gender roles and making the young intern a man made the movie more interesting for Araki, \u201cas a filmmaker who has always been heavily influenced by feminist film theory and feminism in general,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, he was absorbing news stories about Gen Z and how they don\u2019t have sex or relationships anymore and a new dynamic emerged.",
      "\u201cWhat I knew as an old person, as an old-timer, in terms of socialization, dating, sex, all of this stuff that seemed to be kind of falling away,\u201d Araki said. \u201cAnd so that kind of became a major theme of the movie.\u201d",
      "Things Wilde\u2019s character says are things he has also said in interviews about sex and sexuality. Her character gets into generational debates about it. And ultimately it's sex positive.",
      "\u201cIt was very important to me to make something sex positive,\u201d Araki said. \u201c\u2019I Want Your Sex\u2019 is like the opposite of \u2018Babygirl,\u2019 which I found to be very sex negative.\u201d",
      "The film also features a supporting turn from Charli xcx, who was a fan of Araki and whose \u201cBrat\u201d album cover was partially inspired by the title credits to his film \u201cSmiley Face.\u201d When she heard about this new movie, he said, she asked if she could be in it. He was interested, but told her agent that she needed to do a self-tape \u201clike everyone else\u201d to play the part of Hoffman\u2019s girlfriend.",

      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d follows a widowed father \u2014 played by Wagner Moura \u2014 who becomes a target of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s simply because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.",
      "Director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho said that more than one million spectators have seen the film, in a video posted on social media Thursday following the nominations.",
      "Last year, Brazilian feature film \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d was also a box office success, drawing millions of moviegoers. It was nominated in three categories and won best international feature, giving Brazil its first Oscar.",
      "The back-to-back successes are leading many to say that Brazil is living a particularly fruitful moment for its cinema \u2014 including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who said that the local industry is currently \u201cexperiencing one of the best moments in its history.\u201d",
      "The nominations are \u201crecognition of our culture and of Brazil\u2019s ability to tell stories that move the world,\u201d he said on social media.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d is also set during the dictatorship, and observers say both films have contributed to nationwide discussion about the dark period in Brazil's history from 1964 to 1985, when people were tortured and disappeared.",
      "L\u00facia Esp\u00edrito Santo, a 78-year-old retired lawyer, said that she herself had to watch her words when she was studying law at university for fear of disappearing.",
      "\u201cWhat we see in the film happened a lot. People would disappear and you didn\u2019t know why. Friends of mine from college disappeared because they spoke out, they advocated for freedom and democracy,\u201d she said, exiting the cinema after seeing the film.",
      "Sabrina Guimar\u00e3es, a 20-year-old student at a Rio de Janeiro university, who went to see the film Thursday, said learning about the country\u2019s history is essential.",
      "\u201cEven though we learn this stuff at school, we don\u2019t spend much time on it and it\u2019s not very specific. Feeling like you\u2019re there in the person\u2019s shoes, knowing what was happening at the time is very interesting,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good to understand what happened in the past so we don\u2019t repeat these things in the future.\u201d",

      "A trove of Blake Lively's text messages and emails has been released in her legal battle against Justin Baldoni, including exchanges with her longtime friend Taylor Swift",
      "A trove of text messages and emails sent by Blake Lively, including exchanges with her longtime friend Taylor Swift, have been made public by actor-director Justin Baldoni 's lawyers as they prepare for trial.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni and his hired crisis communications expert alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation after she complained about his treatment of her while filming the 2024 romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "The documents were unsealed ahead of Thursday's arguments before a federal judge in New York City about whether to end their acrimonious yearlong litigation, which has threatened to suck in other actors, musicians and celebrities and raised questions about the levers of power, influence and gender dynamics in Hollywood.",
      "Baldoni and his Wayfarer Studios production company countersued Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, accusing them of defamation and extortion. Judge Lewis J. Liman dismissed that suit last June. Liman did not indicate Thursday when he would rule on Lively's case.",
      "At this point, the trial remains scheduled for May 18, and could be star-studded. A document from Lively\u2019s legal team says people likely to have information about the case, besides Swift, include model Gigi Hadid, actors Emily Blunt, Alexis Bledel, America Ferrera and Hugh Jackman, influencer Candace Owens, media personality Perez Hilton and designer Ashley Avignone.",
      "Many of the text messages and emails unsealed Tuesday night were included in filings by Baldoni's lawyers, who argued that they show Lively was strategically manipulating Baldoni\u2019s public image by leveraging connections with her powerful and famous friends.",
      "Swift's messages show that before and after their feud became public, she was advising Lively how to use Hollywood's power dynamics to her advantage.",
      "In April 2024, Lively sent Swift a message containing a link to the \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d trailer \u2014 which would be released publicly weeks later, featuring Swift\u2019s song \u201cMy Tears Ricochet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWow I love how they use the song,\u201d Swift replied. \u201cWelcome to hollywood Justin.\u201d",
      "The women then speculated about how the public would interpret the song\u2019s inclusion in the film.",
      "\u201cIf Justin was strategic/He would be like no Taylor Swift in the trailer/Because that gives you more power over the film, that\u2019s your ally not his,\u201d Swift wrote.",
      "Lively responded: \u201cYou are so right. And so wickedly smart to call it. He should\u2019ve run from your music. I never thought about that. But holy s(asterisk)(asterisk)t. How stupid. This was his only shot at having the appearance of an upper hand.\u201d",
      "After the hearing, Lively's attorney Sigrid McCawley told reporters that the text exchange isn't relevant, and that Lively has done \u201ceverything she can to protect her friends from not being brought into that.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s relevant is her claims that she was sexually harassed in the workplace and the witnesses that were there to see that,\u201d McCawley said.",
      "Attorneys for Baldoni and Swift did not respond Thursday to emailed requests for comment.",
      "In another text exchange, Dec. 4, 2024, Lively checked in with Swift, writing that she felt \u201clike a bad friend lately because I was such a sad sack\u201d who only talked about her own problems \u201cfor months.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration is arguing the government could detain and deport British people under an 18th century wartime act if a president found there was a \u201cBritish invasion\u201d corrupting young Americans",
      "A federal judge hearing arguments Thursday over President Donald Trump\u2019s use of an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan gang members had a question: Could a president use the same law against a \u201cBritish invasion\u201d that was corrupting young minds?",
      "Jennifer Walker Elrod, chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said her query \u2014 a reference to the moral panic in the 1960s over the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands \u2014 was \u201cfanciful,\u201d but a government attorney responded that the president did have that power and courts could not stop him.",
      "\u201cThese sort of questions of foreign affairs and the security of the nation are specifically political issues,\u201d said Drew Ensign, an assistant attorney general who was arguing the administration\u2019s case before the full 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Ensign said it would be up to Congress to check the president in that scenario.",
      "The unexpected and cheeky exchange came in the administration's appeal of a ruling by a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit, one of the most conservative courts in the country, that found Trump inappropriately used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 when he targeted the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua last year.",
      "The act has only been invoked three other times in American history, during the War of 1812 and both world wars. A majority of the three-judge panel agreed in last year's ruling with multiple lower court judges and immigration lawyers who brought the case that it cannot be deployed against a gang rather than a belligerent foreign power.",
      "The administration appealed to the full 5th Circuit, and all 17 judges on the court were present for the arguments in New Orleans on Thursday.",

      "Several of the judges were concerned about second-guessing the president's determination of a threat to the country. Ensign noted the law allows it to be invoked in attempts of \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d and argued that courts should accept a president's declaration that that is happening.",
      "\u201cA predatory incursion is less than an invasion,\u201d Ensign said, arguing that cases involving other laws have determined it happens when foreign fishing boats enter U.S. waters. He also noted that Trump alleged the gang was acting at the behest of recently ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government \u2014 an assertion that has been challenged by some law enforcement analysts.",
      "It's unclear when the circuit will issue its ruling, and the final decision on the constitutionality of Trump's action will likely be made by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The nation's highest court has already had to wade into the tangled legal saga of Trump's invocation of the act twice before. His administration used the act to fly 252 Venezuelans from the United States to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where it contended that U.S. judges had no authority. The Supreme Court ruled that anyone else the administration tried to remove under the act needed a \u201creasonable\u201d opportunity to challenge their designation as a gang member in court.",
      "The following month, as the administration hurried to prepare another flight from Texas, the high court issued an unusual midnight ruling halting flights. It also barred removals under the act until the 5th Circuit could sort out the proper procedures. The high court never weighed in on the constitutionality of Trump's use of the act, giving the 5th Circuit first crack at that question as well.",

By fulltime, the gap had stretched to 5-0.",
      "Yet for Lishoeshoe winger Nteboheleng Leticia Sooane, the result felt beside the point.",
      "For the 16-year-old, the tournament\u2019s most important outcome had little to do with goalmouth scrambles or final-whistle disappointment. Instead, it was about building confidence among girls to trust the HPV vaccine and prevent a disease that kills a woman every two minutes globally \u2014 with the burden most acute in Africa, according to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the tournament\u2019s organizers.",
      "\u201cParticipating in the tournament was very good because we had to learn and spread (the message) even though we did not win the finals. So it was a good experience,\u201d Sooane said as she waited to collect her finalist\u2019s medal in a rain-soaked stadium in Norton, on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Sooane was among about 200 girls from six countries taking part in the CAF Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in December, organized by Africa\u2019s soccer governing body CAF together with the European soccer body, GAVI and health ministries from several African countries.",
      "Dubbed the Goal Getters campaign, the initiative was first showcased in Tanzania and Eswatini earlier last year before moving to Zimbabwe in December, using soccer to build awareness and trust in the HPV vaccine.",
      "Offered for free, the HPV vaccine being administered to girls aged between 9 and 14 years can prevent up to 90% of cervical cancer cases, saving families thousands of dollars in treatment costs later in life if girls are not vaccinated, according to GAVI.",
      "After setbacks caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and uneven national immunization programs, Africa has intensified HPV vaccination drives in recent years. Coverage for at least one dose of the HPV vaccine rose to 40% in 2023 from 28% the previous year, behind only behind North, Central and South America, driven by expanded campaigns backed by governments and GAVI, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The girls\u2019 soccer tournament is a key part of that effort, said GAVI spokesman Olly Cann.",
      "\u201cOne of the great aspects of the Goal Getters campaign is that it enables us to blend two things that teenage girls are passionate about, one is sport and the other is health,\u201d said Cann. \u201cIt creates a really safe space where the girls can feel trusted, they can feel secure, they also feel empowered.\u201d",
      "The campaign\u2019s launch mixed dance and song before the eight-team tournament kicked off. On the sidelines, mothers streamed to a nearby clinic, some drawn by the chance to see well-known women\u2019s soccer figures, while also getting their children vaccinated against HPV.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a common sexually transmitted virus and the primary cause of cervical cancer. While most infections clear naturally, some persist and can lead to cancer years later.",
      "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, killing about 350,000 women each year, according to the WHO. Africa accounts for nearly a quarter of global deaths, and 19 of the 20 most affected countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, Cann said.",

      "Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.",
      "Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a \"ring containment\" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.",

      "It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.",
      "\"If you look at the simple metric of who has saved the most lives, he is right up there with the pantheon. Smallpox eradication has prevented hundreds of millions of deaths,\" said former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden, who consulted with Foege regularly.",

      "The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Donald Trump announced America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\u201d he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations\u2019 specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency\u2019s \u201cfailure to adopt urgently needed reforms\u201d and its \u201cinability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\u201d",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn\u2019t airborne, a stance it didn\u2019t officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",
      "Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal \u201cshortsighted and misguided\u201d and \u201cscientifically reckless.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.",
      "It also signals the U.S. is no longer participating in global flu information-sharing that guides vaccine decisions.",

      "Such disease intelligence has helped Americans be \u201cat the front of the line\u201d when new outbreaks occur and new vaccines and medicines are quickly needed to counteract them and save lives, Gostin said.",
      "Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",
      "Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.",
      "Many emerging viruses are first spotted in China, but \u201cis China going to sign a contract with the United States?\u201d Gostin said. \u201cAre countries in Africa going to do it? Are the countries Trump has slapped with a huge tariff going to send us their data? The claim is almost laughable.\u201d",
      "Gostin also believes Trump overstepped his authority in pulling out of WHO. The U.S. joined the organization through an act of Congress and it is supposed to take an act of Congress to withdraw, he argued.",
      "The U.S. is legally required to give notice one year in advance of withdrawal \u2014 which it did \u2014 but also to pay any outstanding financial obligations.",

      "China's one-child policy led to harsh measures like forced abortions and sterilizations",
      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",
      "China's leaders saw unbridled population growth as a potential threat in 1980 \u2014 to both economic development and its ability to feed what had grown into a nation of 1 billion people.",
      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",
      "But the leadership at the time decided to curb population growth more directly, launching the one-child policy and enforcing it with stiff financial penalties for parents who had more than one child, as well as abortions and sterilization campaigns. It lasted for 35 years.",
      "Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes that the number of people getting sterilized plunged from 1.4 million women and 180,000 men in 2014, two years before the policy was eased, to 190,000 women and 2,600 men in 2020.",

      "Braverman, who was fired from her job as interior minister in 2023 after repeatedly diverging from government policy, said she had quit the Conservatives after 30 years and would represent her southern England constituency in Parliament as a Reform lawmaker.",
      "\u201cWe can either continue down this route of managed decline to weakness and surrender,\u201d Braverman said. \u201cOr we can fix our country, reclaim our power, rediscover our strength. I believe that a better Britain is possible.\u201d",
      "Braverman is the latest high-profile Conservative to embrace Reform leader Nigel Farage's message that Britain is broken and overrun by migrants. Her move on the heels of Robert Jenrick's recent defection gives Farage's party eight of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.",

      "Jo\u00ebl Guerriau, 68, is accused of putting the drug MDMA in a glass of champagne he served to parliament member Sandrine Josso, who left after she started feeling sick. He has admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA but says it was an accident.",

      "Myanmar's military is increasingly using paramotors and gyrocopters to attack civilians and anti-government forces, according to a new report",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Myanmar 's military is making increasing use of commercial paramotors and gyrocopters, low-tech flying machines that expand their capabilities to attack civilians and anti-government forces from the sky as the country's civil war rages, according to a report released Monday.",
      "The military's use of paramotors, basically a paraglider combined with a backpack motor with a propeller, was first reported in 2024, while the first incident involving a gyrocopter, an ultralight one- or two-person aircraft with helicopter-like rotating blades, was last March, the human rights organization Fortify Rights said in its report.",
      "The organization tracked an increasing number of such attacks over the course of last year where pilots would drop mortar shells by hand, and in the case of the paramotors, sometimes cutting their engines and gliding silently in their final approach to the target.",
      "\u201cThe Myanmar military has found new ways to kill civilians from the sky using paramotors and gyrocopters equipped with manually-dropped, unguided explosives,\u201d said Fortify Rights\u2019 Chit Seng in a statement.",
      "In the deadliest such attack recorded, a paramotor in October dropped two shells on anti-election protesters attending a candlelight vigil in the Sagaing region, killing at least 24. In another attack in Sagaing, a gyrocopter attacked a hospital, killing the chief physician and two other hospital staff. The reports were both backed up by interviews with eyewitnesses, Fortify Rights said.",
      "Myanmar's military, known as the Tatmadaw, did not respond to a request for comment on the findings, but regularly insists it does not target civilians.",
      "The military ousted the elected civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering widespread opposition that has spiraled into a civil war. Since then, more than 7,700 civilians have been killed, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog group that tracks political arrests, attacks and casualties.",
      "The attacks by the two types of aircraft documented by Fortify Rights came across Myanmar\u2019s central lowlands in Sagaing, Magway, Mandalay, Ayeyarwady and Bago regions where largely flat terrain makes their low-altitude flight practical. It said the attacks came primarily in opposition-held areas where militia activity is limited or lacking in aerial defense capabilities, as the slow-moving aircraft are particularly vulnerable.",
      "Still, they add to the Tatmadaw's aerial arsenal, which also includes modern jets, helicopters and drones.",
      "They are cheap and easy to operate, can be launched from open fields, and can stay in the air roughly three hours while carrying 30 to 40 mortar shells that are dropped by hand or crude release mechanisms on ground targets.",
      "\u201cParamotors are deployed in areas where armed actors are less sophisticated or lack firepower,\u201d said Morgan Michaels, an analyst with the International Institute of Strategic Studies who runs its Myanmar Conflict Map project and has tracked a similar increase in their usage.",
      "\u201cWe can infer, then, that they also help reduce strain on the air force, allowing the Tatmadaw to redirect more advanced air assets to borderland peripheries where (anti-government militias) operate,\u201d Michaels, who was not involved in the Fortify Rights study, told The Associated Press.",
      "The Fortify Rights data, based on open source reports of attacks and first-hand interviews, suggests increases in attacks starting in July, just ahead of the military government's announcement it would hold elections, and surged in December as the first round of voting began. With Suu Kyi's party banned and opposition largely stifled, critics have said the elections, whose third and final round concluded Sunday, were simply contrived to add a sheen of legitimacy to the military's power.",

      "Overall, the organization counted 304 paramotor and gyrocopter attacks on civilians between December 2024 and Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "Including attacks on the military, there were about 350 total incidents involving such aerial vehicles over roughly that period of time, according to the online Armed Conflict Location and Event Data database, though it lists only about a third as specifically on civilians, Michaels said.",
      "\u201cWe know that the Tatmadaw attacks civilians, and collective punishment has featured as a key component of its counterinsurgency strategy for decades. This is not in dispute,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHowever, open source conflict data is not reliable enough to determine what percentage of aerial attacks constitute the deliberate targeting of civilians versus what percentage are aerial attacks that target combatants but inflict undue harm onto civilians,\" he added.",
      "Even though the militias drawn from Myanmar's ethnic minority groups and pro-democracy \u201cPeople's Defense Forces\u201d have taken large swaths of territory from the military, the fact that paramotors and gyrocopters can be employed effectively underlines how poorly equipped many of the opposition forces continue to be, Michaels said.",
      "\u201cIt shows that the Tatmadaw can still dominate the battlespace across central Myanmar and opposition groups cannot protect civilians against deliberate or disproportional aerial attacks,\u201d he said.",
      "While some countries \u2014 notably China and Russia \u2014 continue to supply Myanmar with military equipment, many others have sanctions prohibiting such trade.",
      "Despite the sanctions, however, Amnesty International reported in a separate analysis on Monday that aviation fuel has continued to enter the country on so-called \u201cghost ships,\u201d which turn off their location tracking systems to avoid detection.",
      "Myanmar's military government also did not respond to questions about the Amnesty report.",
      "Fortify Rights urged governments to reassess sanctions to ensure that components for paramotors and gyrocopters were not getting through.",
      "\u201cU.N. member states must strictly enforce existing sanctions against the Myanmar military junta and issue new sanctions that effectively prohibit the sale or transfer of arms, jet fuel, and dual-use equipment or technologies,\u201d Fortify Rights said.",

      "Authorities in New Zealand have resumed a search for six people presumed killed in a landslide at a popular beach campsite",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A search for six people presumed killed in a landslide at one of New Zealand \u2019s most popular beach campsites is expected to take days, authorities said Monday.",
      "Heavy rain caused the massive slip at Beachside Holiday Park, nestled at the foot of Mount Maunganui, as a summer storm swept down the North Island on Thursday. Those missing ranged in age from 15 to 71 and included a Swedish tourist and a teenager originally from Italy.",
      "Work to find the missing was suspended at the weekend because of fears the ground remained unstable. The search resumed Monday as authorities said the recovery teams were working in dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just holding out for the weather to improve because moisture is the enemy at this point,\u201d police Supt. Tim Anderson said in a statement. \u201cThe ground is saturated and what we need is days of fine weather.\u201d",
      "A wave of mud from the mountain hit the campsite, which is in a picturesque beachside spot named after an extinct volcano. Images showed vehicles, travel trailers and an amenities block crushed by debris.",
      "On Thursday, rescuers said they had heard voices beneath the rubble but by Saturday, authorities said they didn't believe any of those missing had survived. They have been named as Lisa Anne Maclennan, 50; M\u00e5ns Loke Bernhardsson, 20; Jacqualine Suzanne Wheeler, 71; Susan Doreen Knowles, 71; Sharon Maccanico, 15; and Max Furse-Kee, 15.",

      "Along with the six missing at the campsite, the storm killed three others. Also on Thursday, two people were killed when a landslide buried a house in nearby Papamoa. A day earlier, a 47-year-old man from Kiribati was swept away by floodwaters while driving in New Zealand\u2019s far north. His body was found Saturday.",
      "The unusually wet weather prompted questions about whether evacuation orders should have been given before the campsite tragedy. The fire service said Monday that it had delivered a warning from a member of the public about a slip near the holiday park to the local Tauranga City Council, the landowner of the site, four hours before the fatal landslide.",
      "The council said it would hold an independent inquiry into the episode.",

      "China says it is investigating the army\u2019s top general for suspected serious violations of discipline and law",
      "BEIJING -- China made a major announcement over the weekend, saying it was investigating the army\u2019s top general for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. No details have been revealed, but the action is a highly radical move: The general was the highest military member just below President Xi Jinping.",
      "The Defense Ministry said Saturday that authorities were investigating two generals: Gen. Zhang Youxia, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission, China's top military body, and Gen. Liu Zhenli, a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the military\u2019s Joint Staff Department.",
      "The move shakes up virtually the entire commission, chaired by Xi, leaving only one of its six members intact.",
      "\u201cXi Jinping has completed one of the biggest purges of China\u2019s military leadership in the history of the People\u2019s Republic,\u201d said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute\u2019s Center for China Analysis.",
      "For the army and China in general, the full impact of the changes is still unknown. But some experts say the moves also might have repercussions on Beijing's next move on Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own territory.",
      "Here are some elements to understand why Gen. Zhang\u2019s removal is important.",
      "The Defense Ministry announced the measures Saturday but provided no details on the alleged wrongdoing. The next day, the People's Liberation Army Daily published an editorial that fell short of explaining the specific reasons, saying only that it was \u201cfor suspected serious violations of discipline and law\u201d and showed China's commitment to punish corruption. That is something Xi has pursued since the early days of his presidency.",
      "Rumors have circulated on social media and there have been some media reports about the changes, but nothing official.",
      "\"I do not believe any evidence publicly released or selectively leaked by Chinese authorities would necessarily reflect the core reason for Zhang\u2019s removal,\u201d said K. Tristan Tang, nonresident Vasey Fellow at Pacific Forum. \u201cThe critical point is that Xi Jinping decided to move against Zhang; once an investigation is launched, problems are almost inevitably uncovered.\u201d",
      "Analysts have said the purges are designed to reform the military and ensure loyalty to Xi. They are part of a broader anti-corruption drive that has resulted in punishment for more than 200,000 officials since the Chinese leader came to power in 2012.",
      "Before Zhang and Liu's dismissal, the Communist Party expelled the other vice chair of the commission, He Weidong, in October. He was replaced with Zhang Shengmin, who is now the only commission member.",
      "Since 2012, at least 17 Generals from the People's Liberation Army, or PLA, have been removed from their military positions, among them eight who were former top commission members, according to a review of military statements and state media reports made by The Associated Press.",

      "Israel says its military is conducting a large-scale operation to locate the last hostage in Gaza",
      "NAHARIYA, Israel -- Israel said Sunday its military was conducting a \u201clarge-scale operation\u201d to locate the last hostage in Gaza, as Washington and other mediators pressure Israel and Hamas to move into the next phase of their ceasefire.",
      "The statement came as Israel\u2019s Cabinet met to discuss the possibility of opening Gaza\u2019s key Rafah border crossing with Egypt, and a day after top U.S. envoys met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about next steps.",
      "The return of the remaining hostage, Ran Gvili, has been widely seen as removing the remaining obstacle to moving ahead with opening the Rafah crossing and proceeding with the U.S.-brokered ceasefire's second phase.",
      "Late Sunday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said: \"Upon completion of this operations, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the United States, Israel will open the Rafah crossing.\u201d It gave no details on how long that would be, but Israeli military officials were quoted in local media as saying the operation could take days to complete.",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, alive or dead, has been a central part of the first phase of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10. Before Sunday, the previous hostage was recovered in early December.",
      "While Israel has carried out search efforts before for Gvili, more detail than usual was released about this one. Israel\u2019s military said it was searching a cemetery in northern Gaza near the Yellow Line, which marks off Israeli-controlled parts of the territory.",
      "Separately, an Israeli military official said Gvili may have been buried in the Shijaiya-Tuffah area of Gaza City, and that rabbis and dental experts were on the ground with specialized search teams. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing an operation still under way.",
      "Gvili\u2019s family has urged Netanyahu\u2019s government not to enter the ceasefire\u2019s second phase until his remains are returned.",
      "But pressure has been building, and the Trump administration has already declared in recent days that the second phase is under way.",
      "Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas in a statement Sunday said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili\u2019s remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.",

      "Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini of the agency, also known as UNRWA, told The Associated Press the incident was the \u201clatest attack on the U.N. in the ongoing attempt to dismantle the status of Palestine refugees.\u201d",

But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel\u2019s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel, including east Jerusalem.",
      "Israel has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and alleging that some of its employees were involved in the 2023 attack that triggered Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.",

      "Southwest Airlines passengers made their final boarding-time scrambles for seats on Monday as the carrier prepared to end the open-seating system that distinguished it from other airlines for more than a half\u2011century.",
      "Starting Tuesday, customers on Southwest flights will have assigned seats and the option of paying more to get their preferred seat closer to the front of a plane or seats with extra legroom. The airline began selling tickets shaped by the new policy in July.",
      "Here's what travelers can expect as Southwest does away with another of its signature features and becomes more like other airlines:",
      "Under the open-seat system, Southwest customers could check in starting exactly 24 hours before departure to secure places in boarding lines at departure gates.",
      "Early check-ins were placed in the coveted \u201cA\u201d boarding group, essentially guaranteeing they would find an open window or aisle seat. Others landed in \u201cB\u201d or \u201cC,\u201d the likelihood of only middle seats being available rising the longer they waited to check in.",
      "The Dallas-based airline\u2019s unusual seating process began as a way to get passengers on planes quickly and thereby reduce the time that aircraft and crews spent on the ground not making money. It helped Southwest operate more efficiently and to squeeze a few more flights into the daily schedule; the system also was a key reason Southwest remained profitable every year until the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The open-seating arrangement became less democratic over time, however, as Southwest also had starting allowing passengers to pay extra for spots near the front of the line.",
      "An eight\u2011group boarding structure is replacing the find-your-own-seat scrum. Instead of numbered metal columns at departure gates, passengers will file through two alternating lanes once it's time for their group to board.",
      "The airline said its gate areas will be converted in phases starting Monday night, a process that could take about two months to complete. Columns that remain standing past Tuesday will have their numbers removed or covered in the meantime.",
      "Southwest is selling tickets at fares with different seating choices, including standard seats assigned at check\u2011in or paid preferred and extra\u2011legroom seats selected at booking. For certain flights, passengers also will have the option of paying for priority boarding beginning 24 hours before departure.",
      "Newly designed boarding passes will show seat assignments and boarding groups, according to Southwest. A reservation made for nine or fewer people, including families, will assign those passengers to the same boarding group.",

Passengers who purchase seats with extra legroom will be placed in groups 1-2. Customers with premium fares and the airline's \u201cmost loyal travelers\u201d will also have access to preferential seats and earlier boarding, the carrier said, while those with basic fares will likely be placed in groups 6-8.",
      "With the switch to assigned seating also comes a revision of the airline\u2019s policy for customers who need extra room. Under the new rule \u2014 also effective Tuesday \u2014 travelers who do not fit within a single seat\u2019s armrests will be required to purchase an additional seat in advance.",
      "That represents a change from the airline\u2019s previous policy that allowed passengers the choice to purchase a fully refundable extra seat before arriving at the airport, or request a free one at the gate. Under the updated policy, refunds are still possible but no longer guaranteed and depend on seat availability and fare class.",
      "In May 2025, Southwest also ended its decades\u2011old \u201cbags fly free\u201d policy, replacing it with baggage fees for most travelers.",
      "The changes mark one of the biggest transformations in the airline\u2019s history, as it alters its longstanding customer perks to bring it more in line with the practices of other larger U.S. carriers.",

      "Businesses are coming into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, whether it\u2019s public pressure for them to speak out against aggressive immigration enforcement or becoming the sites for arrests themselves",
      "From family-run cafes to retail giants, businesses are increasingly coming into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, whether it's public pressure for them to speak out against aggressive immigration enforcement or becoming the sites for such arrests themselves.",
      "In Minneapolis, where the Department of Homeland Security says it\u2019s carrying out its largest operation ever, hotels, restaurants and other businesses have temporarily closed their doors or stopped accepting reservations amid widespread protests.",
      "On Sunday, after the U.S. Border Patrol shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies including Target, Best Buy and UnitedHealth signed an open letter calling for \"an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.\u201d",
      "Still, that letter didn\u2019t name immigration enforcement directly, or point to recent arrests at businesses. Earlier this month, widely-circulated videos showed federal agents detaining two Target employees in Minnesota. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has rounded up day laborers in Home Depot parking lots and delivery workers on the street nationwide. And last year, federal agents detained 475 people during a raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.",
      "Here's what we know about immigration enforcement in businesses.",
      "Anyone \u2014 including ICE \u2014 can enter public areas of a business as they wish. This can include restaurant dining sections, open parking lots, office lobbies and shopping aisles.",
      "\u201cThe general public can go into a store for purposes of shopping, right? And so can law enforcement agents \u2014 without a warrant,\u201d said Jessie Hahn, senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy nonprofit. As a result, immigration officials may try to question people, seize information and even make arrests in public-facing parts of a business.",
      "But to enter areas with a reasonable expectation of privacy \u2014 like a back office or a closed-off kitchen \u2014 ICE is supposed to have a judicial warrant, which must be signed by a judge from a specified court, and can be limited to certain days or parts of the business.",
      "Judicial warrants should not be confused with administrative warrants, which are signed by immigration officers.",
      "But in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, ICE leadership stated administrative warrants were sufficient for federal officers to forcibly enter people's homes if there\u2019s a final order of removal. Hahn and other immigration rights lawyers say this upends years of precedent for federal agents\u2019 authority in private spaces \u2014 and violates \u201cbedrock principles\u201d of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "Still, the easiest way for ICE to enter private spaces in businesses without a warrant is through consent from an employer, which could be as simple as letting an agent into certain parts of the property. The agency may also cite other \u201cexigent circumstances,\u201d Hahn notes, such as if they\u2019re in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of a certain individual.",
      "Beyond more sweeping workplace raids, enforcement against employers can also take the form of I-9 audits, which focus on verifying employees' authorization to work in the U.S.",
      "Since the start of Trump\u2019s second term, attorneys have pointed to an uptick in instances of ICE physically showing up to a place of business to initiate an I-9 audit. ICE has the authority to do this \u2014 but it marks a shift from prior enforcement, when audits more often began through writing like mailed notices.",
      "David Jones, a regional managing partner at labor and employment law firm Fisher Phillips in Memphis, said he's also seen immigration agents approach these audits with the same approach as recent raids.",
      "\u201cICE is still showing up in their full tactical gear without identifying themselves necessarily, just to do things like serve a notice of inspection,\u201d Jones said. Employers have three days to respond to an I-9 audit, but agents behaving aggressively might make some businesses think they need to act more immediately.",
      "If ICE shows up without a warrant, businesses can ask agents to leave \u2014 or potentially refuse service based on their own company policy, perhaps citing safety concerns or other disruptions caused by agents' presence. But there's no guarantee immigration officials will comply, especially in public spaces.",

      "Because of this, Medeiros said, the question for many businesses becomes less about getting ICE to leave their property and more about what to do if ICE violates consent and other legal requirements.",
      "In Minneapolis \u2014 and other cities that have seen immigration enforcement surges, including Chicago and Los Angeles \u2014 some businesses have put up signs to label private spaces and set wider protocols for what to do when ICE arrives.",

      "Some employers, particularly smaller business owners, are speaking out about ICE's impacts on their workers and customers. But a handful of bigger corporations have stayed largely silent, at least publicly, about enforcement making its way to their storefronts.",
      "Minneapolis-based Target has not commented on videos of federal agents detaining two of its employees earlier this month \u2014 although its incoming chief executive, Michael Fiddelke, sent a video message to the company's over 400,000 workers Monday calling recent violence \u201cincredibly painful,\u201d without directly mentioning immigration enforcement. He said Target was doing \u201ceverything we can to manage what\u2019s in our control.\u201d Fiddelke also signed the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce's letter calling for broader de-escalation, which got support from the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from more than 200 companies.",
      "Target is among companies that organizers with \u201cICE Out of Minnesota\u201d have asked to take stronger public stances over ICE's presence in the state. Others include Home Depot, whose parking lots have become a known site of ICE raids over the last year, and Hilton, which protestors said was among brands of Twin City-area hotels that have housed federal agents.",
      "Hilton and Home Depot didn't respond to comment requests over the activists' calls. Home Depot previously denied being involved in immigration operations.",
      "Several worker groups have been more outspoken. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for a chapter of the Culinary Union in Las Vegas, said members were shocked by a \u201cwidening pattern of unlawful ICE behavior\u201d and \u201crecognize that anti-immigrant policies hurt tourism, business, and their families.\u201d United Auto Workers also expressed solidarity with Minneapolis residents \"fighting back against the federal government\u2019s abuses and attacks on the working class.\u201d",
      "Hahn of the National Immigration Law Center noted some businesses are communicating through industry associations to avoid direct exposure to possible retaliation. Still, she stressed the importance of speaking publicly about the impacts of immigration enforcement overall.",
      "\u201cWe know that the raids are contributing to things like labor shortages and reduced foot traffic,\u201d Hahn said, adding that fears to push back on \u201cthis abuse of power from Trump could ultimately land us in a very different looking economy.\u201d",

Two were high-end real estate brokers dubbed \u201cThe A Team.\u201d The third went to law school and ran their family\u2019s private security firm, which caters to heads of state and the rich and famous.",

      "But behind their posh, peripatetic facade, prosecutors say, Tal, Oren and Alon Alexander \u2014 known collectively as the Alexander Brothers \u2014 were predators who sexually assaulted, trafficked and raped dozens of women from 2008 to 2021, often after incapacitating them with drugs and sometimes recording their crimes on video.",
      "The brothers met victims at nightclubs, parties and on dating apps, and recruited others for trips to ritzy locales, paying for their flights and lodging at high-end hotels or luxe vacation rentals before drugging and raping them, prosecutors said. In all, dozens of women have accused them of wrongdoing.",
      "Now, the brothers \u2014 Tal, 39, and twins Alon and Oren, 38 \u2014 face a reckoning that prosecutors say was more than a decade in the making: a sex-trafficking trial that could put them in prison for the rest of their lives.",

      "So many things went wrong last Jan. 29 to contribute to the deadliest plane crash on American soil since 2001 that the National Transportation Safety Board isn't likely to identify a single cause of the collision between an airliner and an Army helicopter near Washington that killed 67 people at its hearing Tuesday.",
      "Instead, their investigators will detail what they found that played a role in the crash, and the board will recommend changes to help prevent a similar tragedy. Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration already took the temporary restrictions it imposed after the crash and made them permanent to ensure planes and helicopters won't share the same airspace again around Reagan National Airport.",
      "Family members of victims hope those suggestions won't be ignored the same way many past NTSB recommendations have been. Tim Lilley, whose son Sam was the first officer on the American Airlines plane, said he hopes officials in Congress and the administration will make changes now instead of waiting until for another disaster.",
      "\u201cInstead of writing aviation regulation in blood, let\u2019s start writing it in data,\u201d said Lilley, who is a pilot himself and earlier in his career flew Black Hawk helicopters in the Washington area. \u201cBecause all the data was there to show this accident was going to happen. This accident was completely preventable.\"",
      "Over the past year, the NTSB has already highlighted a number of the factors that contributed to the crash including a poorly designed helicopter route past Reagan Airport, the fact that the Black Hawk was flying 78 feet (23.7 meters) higher than it should have been, the warnings that the FAA ignored in the years beforehand and the Army's move to turn off a key system that would have broadcast the helicopter\u2019s location more clearly.",
      "The D.C. plane crash was the first in a number of high-profile crashes and close calls throughout 2025 that alarmed the public, but the total number of crashes last year was actually the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 with 1,405 crashes nationwide.",
      "Experts say flying remains the safest way to travel because of all the overlapping layers of precautions built into the system, but too many of those safety measures failed at the same time last Jan. 29.",
      "Here is some of what we have learned about the crash:",
      "The route along the Potomac River the Black Hawk was following that night allowed for helicopters and planes to come within 75 feet (23 meters) of each other when a plane was landing on the airport's secondary runway that typically handles less than 5% of the flights landing at Reagan. And that distance was only ensured when the helicopter stuck to flying along the bank of the river, but the official route didn't require that.",
      "Normally, air traffic controllers work to keep aircraft at least 500 feet (152 meters) apart to keep them safe, so the scant separation on Route 4 posed what NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy called \u201can intolerable risk to flight safety.\u201d",
      "The controllers at Reagan also had been in the habit of asking pilots to watch out for other aircraft themselves and maintain visual separation as they tried to squeeze in more planes to land on what the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority has called the busiest runway in the country. The FAA halted that practice after the crash.",
      "That night a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. But at the investigative hearings last summer, board members questioned how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.",

      "Before investigators revealed how high the helicopter was flying, Tim Lilley was asking tough questions about it at some of the first meetings NTSB officials had with the families. His background as a pilot gave him detailed knowledge of the issues.",
      "\u201cWe had a moral mandate because we had such an in-depth insight into what happened. We didn\u2019t want to become advocates, but we could not shirk the responsibility,\u201d said Lilley, who started meeting with top lawmakers in Congress, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Army officials not long after the crash to push for changes.",
      "The NTSB has said the Black Hawk pilots may not have realized how high the helicopter was because the barometric altimeter they were relying on was reading 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters) lower than the altitude registered by the flight data recorder.",
      "Investigators tested out the altimeters of three other Black Hawks of the same model from the same Army unit and found similar discrepancies.",

      "And the NTSB found there had been 85 near misses between planes and helicopters around the airport in the three years before the crash along with more than 15,000 close proximity events. Pilots reported collision alarms going off in their cockpits at least once a month.",
      "Officials refused to add a warning to helicopter charts urging pilots to use caution when they used the secondary runway at Reagan the jet was trying to use before the collision.",

      "Carney said his recent agreement with China merely cuts tariffs on a few sectors that were recently hit with tariffs.",
      "Trump claims otherwise, posting that \u201cChina is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen. I only hope they leave Ice Hockey alone! President DJT\u201d",
      "The prime minister said under the free trade agreement with the U.S. and Mexico there are commitments not to pursue free trade agreements with nonmarket economies without prior notification.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of doing that with China or any other nonmarket economy,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWhat we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.\u201d",
      "In 2024, Canada mirrored the United States by putting a 100% tariff on electric vehicles from Beijing and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. China had responded by imposing 100% import taxes on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.",
      "Breaking with the United States this month during a visit to China, Carney cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on those Canadian products.",
      "Carney has said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. He noted there was no cap before 2024. He also has said the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "Trump posted a video Sunday in which the chief executive of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers\u2019 Association warns there will be no Canadian auto industry without U.S. access, while noting the Canadian market alone is too small to justify large scale manufacturing from China.",

The prime minister received widespread praise and attention for his remarks, upstaging Trump at the World Economic Forum.",

      "Over the next two weeks, rehearsals will amp up to some nine hours a day -- all in pursuit of Olympic emotion for what is billed as the most viewed moment of the Games. Some 60,000 people are expected to attend the ceremony live in San Siro, including a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, while millions around the world will watch on official broadcasters.",

      "Volunteers include Balich\u2019s butcher, the head of his office and an 88-year-old widow.",
      "\u201cAnd all of them join in to create something for the nation, for the joy of being part of a huge event like the Olympics,\u2019\u2019 Balich told The Associated Press during a rare behind-the-scenes tour.",
      "The theme of this year\u2019s opening ceremony is \u201cHarmony,\u2019\u2019 an especially potent message as the world order is shaken and populations from Ukraine to Gaza to Iran are exposed to violence.",
      "The concept of an Olympic Truce, originating in ancient Greece and revived by Olympic officials in the 1990s, is even more urgent this year, Balich said. The truce aims to promote peace and dialogue through sport by ceasing hostilities for a week before the Olympics and a week after the Paralympics, which close March 15. Getting belligerents to cooperate is another matter.",
      "\u201cIn this moment, where forces and bullies are predominant, I think it\u2019s very important for all of us to embrace the values that the Olympics represents, which is to compete respectfully and peacefully between all the countries and nations, summarized in the title \u2018Harmony,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Balich said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s federal housing finance director, Bill Pulte, quietly granted government-backed lenders the authority to nearly double a $200 billion bond purchase that Trump ordered to try to lower mortgage rates",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's federal housing finance director, Bill Pulte, quietly granted government-backed lenders the authority to nearly double a $200 billion bond purchase that Trump ordered to try to lower mortgage rates, a move that could introduce a new level of risk for the companies.",
      "An email obtained by The Associated Press that was sent by the Federal Housing Finance Agency to top officials at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac eliminated caps that prohibited the lenders from each holding more than $40 billion in mortgage bonds. The Jan. 12 email says that \u201ceffective immediately\u201d the new amount of mortgage bonds that they could hold in their portfolios was raised to $225 billion apiece.",
      "If the mortgage buyers were to act on the full extent of this new authority, that would amount to a roughly $170 billion increase in bond purchases over what the president instructed them to buy. Neither Pulte nor the FHFA addressed questions about whether Trump or Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was consulted before the increase was enacted.",
      "The changes to the purchasing rules effectively reverse nearly two decades of bipartisan consensus that limits should be imposed after the government had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-09, which led to both being placed into a government conservatorship.",
      "Before this story was published, Pulte took to X, calling it \u201cfake news.\u201d",
      "\u201cFHFA simply gave each entity legal flexibility to go beyond their previous caps,\u201d Pulte wrote Friday, adding that despite the lenders' new bond purchasing authority, they would not \u201cexceed $200 billion.\u201d",
      "The White House, the Treasury Department, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Some members of Congress who were closely involved in the fallout from the financial crisis have raised concerns about Pulte and the Republican administration's new approach. They say any benefit from the mortgage bond purchase will be fleeting unless the tight supply of homes can be increased. Without that, they argue, any decrease in interest rates will only drive up home prices as sellers adapt to the lower cost of borrowing by increasing their asking prices.",
      "\u201cThis is just a smoke screen for Trump and Bill Pulte to tweet about \u2014 it will do little, if anything, to lower mortgage interest rates over the long term and raises questions about increased risks to Fannie and Freddie,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate\u2019s banking committee.",
      "The episode offers the latest example of Pulte\u2019s turbulent tenure in a typically low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Pulte, who also appointed himself chair of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has used the post to cultivate his own political profile and spearheaded efforts to initiate federal criminal investigations of some of Trump\u2019s chief antagonists.",
      "Pulte was identified as a driving force behind the administration\u2019s decision to criminally investigate Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to Bloomberg News, provoking an outcry from some prominent Republicans in Congress.",
      "Pulte has presided over the firing of executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as ethics officials at Fannie Mae who were investigating him and his allies. He also has pushed Trump to endorse policy ideas that were widely panned. In November, Pulte convinced Trump of the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building \u2014 a proposal that would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.",
      "Fannie Mae was created in 1938 as part of the New Deal to shore up the mortgage industry. Congress created Freddie Mac in 1970 to provide additional liquidity to the housing market. The institutions buy up the vast majority of mortgages that lenders issue to homeowners, which are then packaged into bonds that are sold to investors.",
      "Both now exist as private companies, but due to their government charters, are subject to additional regulation and can borrow money at far lower costs. Because of this government affiliation, markets also broadly recognize the financial products they sell as federally guaranteed.",
      "But there is a tension between the lenders' public mission and their desire to generate earnings, which has at times led both to take on heightened levels of risk, as was the case before the financial crisis. That led to both being placed in a government conservatorship.",

      "As a result, the federal government forced Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to draw down their mortgage investment portfolios, which the Treasury capped at $450 billion. The FHFA went further, gradually ratcheting down the amount of mortgage bonds they could each retain, which was set as low as $25 billion earlier this year, records show.",
      "Now Pulte is overseeing a reversal of that. Both lenders are still subject to the Treasury's $450 billion cap. But with their newly granted limits, they can adjust their portfolios to take on a far more aggressive \u2014 and riskier \u2014 approach toward buying mortgage bonds.",
      "At first, Pulte took a slow approach. In recent months, the FHFA granted Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac small increases in their mortgage bond buying capacities, which essentially served as a test run for Trump's announcement this month, according to housing market analysts.",
      "Now that both lenders have the authority to stake out a larger position, they could use it to boost earnings before an anticipated initial public offering that would allow investors to buy significant stakes in the companies. Neither company, however, seems to have enough cash or liquid assets to make a $225 billion purchase, which could require taking on debt, analysts say.",
      "Though Pulte maintains that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would not buy more bonds than Trump ordered, the email that his agency sent to the lenders did not directly address the issue.",
      "The email instructed the companies to increase bond investments to \u201cexert meaningful downward pressure\" on rates. Both companies were directed to submit purchasing plans to the FHFA, but the agency also made clear that the \u201ccommencement of increases\u201d in purchases did not require its approval first.",
      "The moves demonstrate the extent to which mortgage interest rates have become a political liability for Trump before the midterm elections in November, when Republicans\u2019 control of Congress will be on the line.",
      "But the plan, as announced by Trump, has already been criticized by many economists and housing policy experts as a gimmick considering the mammoth size of the $13 trillion U.S. mortgage market.",
      "\u201cIt does raise the question of whether we\u2019re letting the genie back out of the bottle. That wouldn\u2019t be so worrisome if the genie hadn\u2019t done so much damage the last time around,\u201d said Jim Parrott, who served on the National Economic Council during Democrat Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and counseled him on housing issues.",
      "Edward Pinto, a resident fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, likened Trump's initial $200 billion announcement to a \u201csugar high.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may have an effect, but it will be fleeting,\u201d said Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive. He noted that while Trump's announcement briefly drove mortgage rates down, they ticked back up after Trump threatened a takeover of Greenland.",
      "\u201cIt's easy for the federal government to make a mistake here. They've done it in the past,\u201d Pinto said.",

      "FDA testing also found contamination in a sample of whole milk powder supplied to ByHeart \u2014 and it matched the germ in a finished sample of the company's formula.",
      "The findings are not conclusive, and the investigation continues \u201cto determine the source of the contamination,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",

The problem was identified in November after officials with the California program that supplies the sole treatment for infant botulism detected a surge in cases in babies who consumed ByHeart formula.",

      "BLANTYRE, Malawi -- The southern African nation of Malawi began a cholera vaccination rollout this week in a bid to stem the threat of the disease that kills tens of thousands of people globally each year.",
      "Cholera is avoidable when there is access to clean water and largely treatable with rehydration medication, and there are effective vaccines.",
      "Malawi is one of several countries in Africa that face the perennial threat of cholera, and that's been exacerbated this year by unusually heavy rains and flooding in the southern African region, the kind of weather that often prompts cholera outbreaks.",
      "Cholera is an acute diarrhea disease caused by a bacteria typically spread through contaminated food or water.",
      "The continent suffered a major setback in its battle against cholera last year when cases surpassed 300,000, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control \u2014 the worst toll in 25 years.",
      "One of the areas targeted by Malawian health officials for the three-day rollout that ended on Friday was the densely populated Chilomoni township in the commercial capital, Blantyre. At least 17 people have been diagnosed with cholera in the city in recent weeks, with one death reported, and authorities warned of \u201ca steady rise\u201d in cases nationally.",
      "Dr. Gift Kawalazira, director of health and social services at the Blantyre District Health Office, said Thursday that officials had identified unsafe water sources as the likely reason for the cholera cases reported in Chilomoni \u2014 underlining how the disease especially impacts impoverished communities with restricted access to clean water.",
      "Residents often pay about 5 U.S. cents for a 20\u2011liter bucket (around 5 gallons) of clean water from private taps in Chilomoni. But when they can't afford that fee, some turn to the nearby Muluda stream, a waterway contaminated with human and animal waste, for drinking, cooking and washing.",
      "\u201cYou can see others bring their kitchen utensils and wash them right here and also wash their clothes,\u201d Kawalazira said. \u201cThis is the water that is causing cholera.\u201d",
      "Malawi hopes to roll out 24,000 of the oral vaccines as a start, though officials say many more are needed for the country.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the most vulnerable populations,\" Kawalazira said, calling it \u201ca good number to start with.\u201d Cooperation between health workers and people was key, Kawalazira said, in containing the outbreak.",
      "The global cholera vaccine stockpile was severely depleted by 2022 because of demand and limited suppliers, and that left poorer countries scrambling to contain outbreaks. In Malawi, one of its worst outbreaks killed nearly 2,000 people that year.",
      "Among those seeking protection in Chilomoni this week were 24\u2011year\u2011old Harriet George, who brought her two children to a vaccination point on Thursday.",

      "Africa has sought to invest in its own vaccine production given that cholera has become resurgent. In November, a South African pharmaceutical firm launched trials on what it hopes will be the first African-produced cholera vaccine.",
      "Cholera often becomes a threat during rainy seasons, and health officials in Malawi have been spurred into action by unusually heavy rainfall in the southern African region since late last year that has caused devastating flooding in parts of South Africa and Mozambique.",
      "Humanitarian organizations have warned that there is now a grave danger of large cholera outbreaks in Mozambique, where more than 500,000 people have been impacted by the floods and could be cut off from safe drinking water and food.",

      "The Congress was framed by Vietnam\u2019s defining national question: whether the country can transform itself into a high-income economy by 2045. During the meeting, Vietnam set a target of average annual GDP growth of 10% or more from 2026 to 2030.",
      "The gathering brought together nearly 1,600 delegates to define Vietnam's political and economic direction through 2031. It also confirmed a slate of senior appointments, electing 19 members to the Politburo, the country\u2019s top leadership body.",
      "Beyond settling the question of who will lead Vietnam through 2031, the Congress will also determine how the country\u2019s single-party system responds to world grown increasingly turbulent as China and the United States wrangle over trade and Washington under President Donald Trump challenges a longstanding global order.",

At the same time it must balance relations with major powers. It also faces overlapping territorial claims with China, its largest trading partner, in the South China Sea.",
      "Lam has overseen Vietnam's most ambitious bureaucratic and economic reforms since the late 1980s, when it liberalized its economy. Under his leadership, the government has cut tens of thousands of public-sector jobs, redrawn administrative boundaries to speed decision-making, and initiated dozens of major infrastructure projects.",
      "Lam spent decades in the Ministry of Public Security before becoming its minister in 2016. He led an anti-corruption campaign championed by his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong. During his rise, Vietnam\u2019s Politburo lost six of its 18 members during an anti-graft campaign, including two former presidents and Vietnam\u2019s parliamentary head.",

      "Franzoni\u2019s victory Saturday relegated overall World Cup leader Marco Odermatt to second place, and left the Swiss standout in tears on the podium after again failing to win the Kitzb\u00fchel downhill.",

      "Odermatt won the super-G in Kitzb\u00fchel on Friday for a second year. But he\u2019s been racing in \u201cKitz\u201d for eight years; whereas Franzoni won the Kitzb\u00fchel downhill on his second try, at age 24.",
      "Unlike many professional skiers, Franzoni did not grow up in the mountains.",
      "He comes from Manerba del Garda on the shore of Lake Garda near the city of Brescia.",
      "But he and his twin brother, Alessandro, quickly took to skiing at nearby Ponte di Legno and Madonna di Campiglio.",
      "While his brother eventually stopped competing and became a ski instructor instead, Giovanni showed his promise by claiming three golds, a silver and a bronze at the world junior championships in 2021 and 2022.",
      "Franzoni\u2019s rise was slowed, though, when he had a season-ending fall in a super-G at Wengen in 2023 that resulted in thigh surgery.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Jannik Sinner may have felt lucky to survive the Australian Open third round but he rebounded quickly in a 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 (2) win Monday over fellow Italian Luciano Darderi to reach the quarterfinals for a ninth consecutive Grand Slam event.",
      "The two-time defending champion struggled with the extreme heat and cramping in his Saturday afternoon win over No. 85-ranked Eliot Spizzirri, and only took control after the roof was closed in the third set.",
      "Sinner later admitted he got a bit lucky with the timing of the extreme heat policy being invoked, leading to an eight-minute break to close the roof. He was also able to refresh in a 10-minute extra cooling break between the third and fourth sets.",
      "In an evening match in cooler conditions Monday, he was cruising until Darderi lifted his tempo in the third set. Second-ranked Sinner missed match points in the 10th game on Darderi's serve but then took it up a notch in the tiebreaker.",
      "\u201cI felt quite good out there physically. Everything was okay today,\u201d said Sinner, who had limited practice on his off day between his third- and fourth-round matches. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s coming in the next round.\u201d",
      "Toward the end of the match Darderi, in his first official head-to-head with Sinner, increased the speed of his forehand as he went for everything, and also added intensity to his serve.",
      "Darderi took the first two points of the tiebreaker but then had to pause for a few moments before serving because of a baby crying in the crowd at Margaret Court Arena.",
      "He didn't win another point. Sinner reeled off the next seven to triumph in 2 hours and nine minutes.",

      "The ordinary matter all around us \u2014 stars, planets and people \u2014 makes up just 5% of the universe. For decades, researchers have hoped to demystify what's known as dark matter, a material that comprises just over a quarter of our universe.

      "The latest map, created with images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, is the most detailed yet over such a large patch of sky. It has twice the resolution of previous attempts using the Hubble Space Telescope and captures hundreds of thousands of galaxies over the past 10 billion years.",

      "The latest map, published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy, includes information on new galaxy clusters and the strands of dark matter that connect them. Piece by piece, these structures help form the skeleton of the universe. Scientists can study this map to see how dark matter has clumped up over billions of years.",

      "LONDON -- The European Union opened a formal investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X on Monday after his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok started spewing nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.",
      "European regulators also widened a separate, ongoing investigation into X's recommendation systems after the platform said it would switch to Grok's AI system to choose which posts users see.",
      "The scrutiny from Brussels comes after Grok sparked a global backlash by allowing users through its AI image generation and editing capabilities to undress people, putting females in transparent bikinis or revealing clothing. Researchers said some images appeared to include children. Some governments banned the service or issued warnings.",
      "The 27-nation EU's executive said it was looking into whether X has done enough as required by the bloc's digital regulations to contain the risks of spreading illegal content such as \"manipulated sexually explicit images.\"",
      "That includes content that \u201cmay amount to child sexual abuse material,\" the European Commission said. These risks have now \u201cmaterialized,\u201d the commission said, exposing the bloc's citizens to \u201cserious harm.\u201d",
      "Regulators will examine whether Grok is living up to its obligations under the Digital Services Act, the bloc's wide-ranging rulebook for keeping internet users safe from harmful content and products.",
      "In response to a request for comment, an X spokeswoman directed The Associated Press to an earlier statement that the company remains \u201ccommitted to making X a safe platform for everyone\" and that it has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for child sexual exploitation, nonconsensual nudity, and unwanted sexual content.",
      "The X statement from Jan. 14 also said it would stop allowing users to depict people in \u201cbikinis, underwear or other revealing attire,\u201d but only in places where it has been deemed illegal.",

      "Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI launched Grok's image tool last summer. But the problem began snowballing only late last month when Grok seemingly granted a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others. The problem was amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative with fewer safeguards than rivals, and because Grok\u2019s images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "The EU investigation covers only Grok's service on X, and not Grok's website and standalone app. That's because the DSA applies only to the biggest online platforms.",
      "There\u2019s no deadline for the bloc to resolve the case, which could end in either X pledging to change its behavior or a hefty fine.",
      "In December Brussels issued X with a 120-million euro (then-$140 million) fine as part of the earlier ongoing DSA investigation, for shortcomings including blue checkmarks that broke the rules on \u201cdeceptive design practices\u201d that risked exposing users to scams and manipulation.",

      "Millions of people rely on wearable devices to monitor how well they're sleeping",
      "ATLANTA -- Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Should you believe it?",
      "Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don\u2019t necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken.",
      "The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used.",
      "Here's a look at the technology \u2014 and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized.",
      "Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables.",
      "The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you\u2019re having versus REM sleep, that\u2019s where the in-lab studies really excel,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night.",
      "Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. Nor should any single night's data be seen as significant.",
      "\u201cWe would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep \u2014 and that is what the wearables do not do,\u201d she said.",
      "Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on \u201csleep hygiene\u201d such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. She advises those concerned about their sleep to consult a clinician before spending money on a wearable.",
      "Forger takes a more favorable view toward the devices, which he says help keep the overlooked importance of sleep front of mind. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day.",
      "\u201cSeeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you\u2019re giving yourself the right amount of time, if you\u2019re sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won\u2019t be as efficient,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: \u201cIt\u2019s so accurate,\u201d she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. After noticing that the few nights she drank alcohol coincided with poorer sleep quality, she decided to give up alcohol.",

      "Another trend she says she detected in the ring's data: the importance of not eating too late if she wants to get good rest.",
      "\u201cI always struggle with going to bed, and it\u2019s often because I eat late at night,\u201d Stoye said. \u201cI know that about myself, and it knows it too.\u201d",
      "Mai Barreneche, who works in advertising in New York City, used to wear her Oura Ring constantly. She said it helped her develop good sleep habits and encouraged her to maintain a daily morning exercise regimen. But as a metric-driven person, she became \"obsessed\" enough with her nightly sleep scores that it began to cause her anxiety \u2014 a modern condition that researchers have dubbed \u201corthosomnia.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember I would go to bed thinking about the score I was going to get in the morning,\u201d Barreneche said.",
      "Barreneche decided not to wear her ring on a beach vacation a few years ago, and when she returned home, she never put it back on. She said she has maintained the good habits the device pointed her toward, but no longer wants the stress of monitoring her nightly scores.",
      "Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Comparing sleep types and stages is ill-advised since individual needs vary by age, genetics and other factors, she said.",
      "\u201cThese devices are supposed to help you,\" Branson said. \"And if you feel anxious or worried or frustrated about it, then it\u2019s not helpful, and you should really talk to a professional.\u201d",
      "Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse.",
      "\u201cThe body is making these really interesting and really important decisions that we\u2019re not aware of to keep us healthy and active and alert at the right times of day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have an infection, that rhythm very quickly starts to disappear because the body goes into overdrive to start fighting the infection. Those are the kind of things we can pick up.\u201d",
      "The technology could be particularly useful in low-resource communities, where wearables could help health issues to be identified more quickly and monitored remotely without requiring access to doctors or specialized clinics, according to Forger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this really important story that\u2019s about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,\u201d he said.",

      "It's easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it's not great for the environment and it's not the most effective option out there.",
      "\"There's a chart we reference that\u2019s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it\u2019s not going to do any more than it already does,\u201d said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.",
      "In those conditions, other products \u2014 calcium chloride, magnesium chloride \u2014 release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.",
      "The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.",
      "But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.",
      "Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.",
      "Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.",
      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,\u201d Bennett says.",
      "Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment \u2014 stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.",
      "\u201cTheir paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they\u2019re chewing them because that\u2019s the only way they know to make it feel better,\u201d said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.",

      "Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.",
      "Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it's put. And a Korean company, Star's Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.",
      "Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.",
      "\u201cPeople wait until after the storm to start shoveling,\" Tirado said. \"That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re having 1 to 2 inches.

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",
      "Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly \u2014 crucial if the debris is dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. \u201cBut once it gets to the point that it\u2019s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\u201d",
      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

      "Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.",

      "The strategic importance of the Arctic territory \u2014 under the flight paths that nuclear-armed missiles from China and Russia could take on their way to incinerating targets in the United States, and vice versa \u2014 is one of the reasons U.S. President Donald Trump has cited in his disruptive campaign to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark, alarming Greenlanders and longtime allies in Europe alike.",

      "The earthquake-proof skyscraper of steel and glass has captured the imagination of professional rock climber Alex Honnold for more than a decade. On Saturday morning, he will climb it in his signature free solo style \u2014 without ropes or protective equipment. And Netflix will broadcast it \u2014 live.",
      "The event\u2019s announcement has drawn both excitement and trepidation, as well as some concerns over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast. Many have questioned Honnold\u2019s desire to continues his free-solo climbs now that he\u2019s a married father of two young girls.",
      "Known for his legendary ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, documented in \u201cFree Solo,\u201d Honnold is intent on pushing the limits of climbing around the world.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at climbing objectives, you look for things that are singular,\u201d Honnold told The Associated Press late last year. \u201cSomething like El Capitan where it\u2019s way bigger and way prouder than all the things around it.\u201d",
      "Something like Taipei 101.",
      "Honnold won\u2019t be the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he will be the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004, as part of the grand opening of what was then the world's tallest building. He took nearly four hours to finish, almost twice as long as what he anticipated, all while nursing an injured elbow and battered by wind and rain.",
      "Honnold, who has been training for months, doesn't think his climb will be hard. He\u2019s practiced the moves on the building and spoke with Robert on his climbing podcast.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that extreme,\u201d Honnold said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s the perfect sweet spot where it\u2019s hard enough to be engaging for me and obviously an interesting climb.\u201d",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment will have eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by a balcony that Honnold would be able to rest on.",
      "The \u201cSkyscraper Live\u201d broadcast will be on a 10-second delay and begin Friday evening for viewers in the U.S.",
      "James Smith, an executive with event producer Plimsoll Productions, said he consulted safety advisers almost immediately after he first spoke with Honnold about attempting the climb. Smith works with a risk management group for film and TV called Secret Compass, which has supported productions in filming penguins in Antarctica and helping Chris Hemsworth walk across a crane projecting from an Australian skyscraper's roof, alike.",
      "Smith and Honnold will be able to communicate throughout the event. They\u2019ll have cameramen positioned inside the building, various hatches and places to bail during the climb and four high-angle camera operators suspended on ropes.",
      "\u201cThese people all know Alex. They trust Alex. They\u2019re going to be close to him throughout the whole climb,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get us kind of amazing shots, but they\u2019re also there just to keep an eye on him, and if there\u2019s any problems, they can kind of help.\u201d",
      "The production has also commissioned professional weather forecasters to provide updates leading up to climb day. There's currently a small chance of light rain in the morning, Smith said. Ultimately, if conditions are bad, Honnold won\u2019t climb.",
      "At his local gym, Taiwanese rock climber Chin Tzu-hsiang said he\u2019s grown up always looking up at the Taipei 101 and wondering if he could climb it. Honnold is a household name among rock climbers even in Taiwan, and Chin said he has students who have only been climbing for a year or two who are excited to watch. Based on watching Honnold in his other climbs, Chin said he trusts him to prepare for the challenge and not to recklessly take risks.",

      "\u201cIt fits everything I'd been thinking,\u201d she said.",

Cross-hatched markings on a piece of rock in South Africa have been dated to about 73,000 years ago.",

      "The polar vortex, a patch of bitter cold air that often stays penned up in northern Canada and Alaska, is being elongated by a wave in the upper atmosphere that goes back to a relatively ice-free part of the Arctic and snow-buried Siberia. As the bone-chilling temperatures sweep through the U.S., they'll meet with moisture from off California and the Gulf of Mexico to set up crippling ice and snow in many areas.",
      "The origins of the system begin in the Arctic, where relatively warmer temperatures add energy to the polar vortex and help push its cold air south.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is aligned perfectly that the pattern is locked into this warm Arctic, cold continent,\" Maue said. \"And it\u2019s not just here for us in North America, but the landmass of Eastern Europe to Siberia is also exceptionally cold. The whole hemisphere has gone into the deep freeze.\u201d",
      "As far back as October 2025, changes in the Arctic and low sea ice were setting up conditions for the kind of stretched polar vortex that brings severe winter weather to the U.S., said winter weather expert Judah Cohen, an MIT research scientist. Heavy Siberian snowfall added to the push-and-pull of weather that warps the shape of the normally mostly circular air pattern. Those conditions \u201ckind of loaded the dice a bit'' for a stretching of the polar vortex, he said.",
      "Cohen co-authored a July 2025 study that found more stretched polar vortex events linked to severe winter weather bursts in the central and eastern U.S. over the past decade. Cohen said part of the reason is that dramatically low sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas in the Arctic helps set up a pattern of waves that end up causing U.S. cold bursts. A warmer Arctic is causing sea ice in that region to shrink faster than other places, studies have found.",
      "Arctic sea ice is at a record low extent for this time of year, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",
      "The center of the stretched polar vortex will be somewhere above Duluth, Minnesota, by Friday morning, ushering in \u201clong-lasting brutal cold,\u201d Maue said. Temperatures in the North and Midwest will get about as cold as possible, even down to minus 25 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 32 to minus 34 degrees Celsius), Maue said. The average low temperature for the Lower 48 states will dance around 11 or 12 degrees (minus 12 to minus 11 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Maue said.",

Last year, Wedding was indicted on new charges of orchestrating the killing of a witness in Colombia to help him avoid extradition to the U.S.",
      "Wedding was previously convicted in the U.S. of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced to prison in 2010. Online records show he was released from Bureau of Prisons custody in 2011.",
      "In Canada, Wedding faces separate drug charges dating back to 2015.",
      "The 2024 indictment says Wedding ran a billion-dollar drug trafficking group that was the largest supplier of cocaine to Canada. The group obtained cocaine from Colombia and worked with Mexican cartels to move drugs by boat and plane to Mexico and then into the U.S. using semitrucks, the indictment said. It said the group stored cocaine in Southern California before sending it to Canada and other U.S. states.",

      "The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying warships have arrived in the Middle East",
      "WASHINGTON -- The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and three accompanying warships have arrived in the Middle East, bringing a renewed potential that President Donald Trump could opt to order airstrikes on Iran over its crackdown on protesters.",
      "The carrier, along with three destroyers, \u201cis currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability,\u201d U.S. Central Command said Monday on social media.",
      "The strike group was in the Indian Ocean, Central Command said, and not in the Arabian Sea, which borders Iran. It will bring thousands of additional service members to the region, which has not had a U.S. aircraft carrier since the USS Gerald R. Ford was ordered in October to sail to the Caribbean as part of a pressure campaign on then-Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Trump told reporters last week that the ships were sent to the region \u201cjust in case.\u201d \u201cWe have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won\u2019t have to use it,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump earlier had threatened military action if Iran carried out mass executions of prisoners or killed peaceful demonstrators during a crackdown on protests that began in late December. At least 5,973 people have been killed and more than 41,800 detained, according to activists. The official Iranian death toll is far lower, at 3,117 dead.",
      "More recently, Trump appeared to have backed away from possible action, claiming Iran halted the hangings of 800 detained protesters. He has not elaborated on the source of the claim, which Iran\u2019s top prosecutor called \u201ccompletely false.\u201d",

      "The aircraft carrier hosts multiple squadrons of aircraft, including F-35 Lightning II fighter jets and F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets. Meanwhile, the destroyers bring with them hundreds of missiles, which could include dozens of Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles.",
      "In addition to the aircraft carrier and its hardware, the U.S. military said the Air Force F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet now has a presence in the region.",
      "Analysts who follow flight-tracking data have noticed dozens of U.S. military cargo planes also heading to the region.",
      "The activity is similar to last year when the U.S. moved in air defense hardware, including a Patriot missile system, in anticipation of an Iranian counterattack following the bombing of three key nuclear sites. Iran launched over a dozen missiles at Al Udeid Air Base days after the strikes.",

      "Immigration enforcement agents imprisoned some Columbia students who had participated in pro-Palestinian protests in 2024. The administration canceled $400 million in research grants at the school and its affiliated hospital system in the name of combating antisemitism on campus, and threatened to withhold billions of dollars more in government support.",

      "The seven were students at the University of Hawaii and cadets in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, on track to become Army officers, when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. They initially served in the Hawaii Territorial Guard, but soon after the attack the U.S. barred most Japanese Americans from service and deemed them enemy aliens.",
      "The seven cadets instead worked with a civilian labor battalion known as \u201cVarsity Victory Volunteers,\u201d which performed tasks such as digging ditches and breaking rocks, until American leaders in early 1943 announced the formation of a segregated Japanese American regiment. The seven were among those who joined the unit, known as the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.",
      "The combat team, along with the 100th battalion comprised of mostly Japanese Americans from Hawaii, went on to become one of the most decorated units in U.S. history. Some of its soldiers fought for the Allies even as their relatives were detained in Japanese American internment camps because they were considered a public danger.",

Nakoa Hoe of the 100th Battalion, 442nd Regiment, what the unit is now known as in the Army Reserve. He noted the once-segregated unit now includes a \u201cmultitude of cultures.\u201d",
      "The seven \u201csacrificed so much at a challenging time when their loyalty to their country was questioned and they even had family members imprisoned,\u201d he added.",
      "The seven men \u2014 Daniel Betsui, Jenhatsu Chinen, Robert Murata, Grover Nagaji, Akio Nishikawa, Hiroichi Tomita and Howard Urabe \u2014 died fighting in Europe in 1944. All but Murata were killed during the campaign to liberate Italy from Nazi Germany. Murata was killed by an artillery shell in eastern France.",

      "Monday's ceremony capping efforts to honor the men comes amid growing concern and criticism that President Donald Trump's administration is whitewashing American history ahead of the nation celebrating 250 years of its independence, including last week's removal of an exhibit on slavery at Philadelphia\u2019s Independence National Historical Park.",
      "Last year, the Pentagon said internet pages honoring a Black Medal of Honor winner and Japanese American service members were mistakenly taken down \u2014 but it staunchly defended its overall campaign to strip out content singling out the contributions by women and minority groups, which the Trump administration considers \u201cDEI.\u201d",

Col. Jerrod Melander, who previously led the University of Hawaii's ROTC program as professor of military science.",

      "The ban was one of several ways the Trump administration made life harder for international students during his first year back in the White House, including a pause in visa appointments and additional layers of vetting that contributed to a dip in foreign enrollment for first-time students. New students had to look elsewhere, but the hurdles made life particularly complicated for those like Thaw who were well into their U.S. college careers.",

      "\u201cInstead of writing aviation regulation in blood, let\u2019s start writing it in data,\u201d said Lilley, who is a pilot himself and earlier in his career flew Black Hawk helicopters in the Washington area. \u201cBecause all the data was there to show this accident was going to happen. This accident was completely preventable.\u201d",
      "Over the past year, the NTSB has already highlighted a number of the factors that contributed to the crash including a poorly designed helicopter route past Reagan Airport, the fact that the Black Hawk was flying 78 feet (23.7 meters) higher than it should have been, the warnings that the FAA ignored in the years beforehand and the Army's move to turn off a key system that would have broadcast the helicopter\u2019s location more clearly.",
      "The D.C. plane crash was the first in a number of high-profile crashes and close calls throughout 2025 that alarmed the public, but the total number of crashes last year was actually the lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020 with 1,405 crashes nationwide.",
      "Experts say flying remains the safest way to travel because of all the overlapping layers of precautions built into the system, but too many of those safety measures failed at the same time last Jan. 29.",
      "Here is some of what we have learned about the crash:",
      "The route along the Potomac River the Black Hawk was following that night allowed for helicopters and planes to come within 75 feet (23 meters) of each other when a plane was landing on the airport's secondary runway that typically handles less than 5% of the flights landing at Reagan. And that distance was only ensured when the helicopter stuck to flying along the bank of the river, but the official route didn't require that.",
      "Normally, air traffic controllers work to keep aircraft at least 500 feet (152 meters) apart to keep them safe, so the scant separation on Route 4 posed what NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy called \u201can intolerable risk to flight safety.\u201d",
      "The controllers at Reagan also had been in the habit of asking pilots to watch out for other aircraft themselves and maintain visual separation as they tried to squeeze in more planes to land on what the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority has called the busiest runway in the country. The FAA halted that practice after the crash.",
      "That night a controller twice asked the helicopter pilots whether they had the jet in sight, and the pilots said they did and asked for visual separation approval so they could use their own eyes to maintain distance. But at the investigative hearings last summer, board members questioned how well the crew could spot the plane while wearing night vision goggles and whether the pilots were even looking in the right spot.",

      "A collision between a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines jet killed 67 people in January 2025",
      "Investigators have uncovered numerous factors that contributed to a U.S. Army helicopter and a passenger airplane colliding over Washington last January, killing 67 people in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will discuss the investigation's findings Tuesday and recommend changes to prevent similar tragedies. Thursday marks one year since the crash.",
      "The NTSB has said the helicopter was flying higher than it was supposed to and the altimeter the pilots relied on was faulty. Plus, the Federal Aviation Administration failed to act on warnings about the risks around Washington that the NTSB said should have been clear years earlier.",
      "The FAA is making temporary changes it imposed after the crash permanent. The rules say helicopters and planes can't share the same airspace around Reagan National Airport, and they prohibit air traffic controllers from relying on visual separation and require all military aircraft to broadcast their locations.",
      "Here's a timeline of events related to the crash:",
      "Around 8:15 p.m., American Airlines Flight 5342, with 64 people on board, begins its initial descent into Reagan National Airport.",
      "At 8:43, from the airport\u2019s tower, a controller asks the plane's pilots to switch from landing on Runway 1 to Runway 33. Nearby an Army Black Hawk helicopter, referred to as PAT25 by air traffic control, is flying south over the river. The skies are clear.",
      "As the helicopter approaches the airport, the cockpit voice recorder captures the pilot saying it is flying at 300 feet (91 meters) and the instructor pilot says it is at 400 feet (122 meters). The discrepancy isn't explained and the helicopter continues to descend. The helicopter route\u2019s allowed altitude decreases the closer it gets to the airport, capping at 200 feet (61 meters).",
      "At 8:46, the controller radios the Black Hawk crew to say a passenger jet, referred to as CRJ, is at 1,200 feet (365 meters) and circling to Runway 33. The helicopter's pilots say they see the jet and ask to maintain visual separation \u2014 to fly closer than if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approve the request.",
      "At 8:47 \u2014 20 seconds before impact \u2014 the controller radios: \u201cPAT25, do you have the CRJ in sight?\u201d while a conflict alarm sounds. Then, again: \u201cPAT25, pass behind the CRJ.\u201d But the NTSB said the helicopter's recorder shows the pilots may never have heard that instruction.",
      "One second later the plane\u2019s crew gets a collision avoidance alert declaring \u201cTraffic! Traffic!\u201d",
      "A few seconds later, a crew member on the helicopter replies that the aircraft \u201cis in sight\u201d and again requests \u201cvisual separation.\"",
      "Just after the plane descends past its last recorded altitude of 313 feet (95 meters), the pilots pull up the nose sharply in an evasive maneuver one second before impact.",
      "Then a commotion is heard on the tower audio. A flash appears in the sky, and both aircraft fall into the river. Moments later someone says over the radio, \u201cTower, did you see that?\u201d",
      "In the ensuing hours and days, crews search the chilly Potomac for survivors.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal immigration officer touched off a fierce national debate and prompted some fellow Republicans to question President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials.",
      "After remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations.

      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, saying that she believes Noem is attempting to \"mislead the American public\u201d about the fatal shooting of a 37 year-old protester in Minneapolis.",
      "The call from Rosen, a moderate from Nevada who was part of the group that helped Republicans end the 43-day government shutdown last year, comes amid a growing fury from congressional Democrats who have also vowed to block funding for the Homeland Security Department. A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.",
      "\u201cKristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year \u2014 and the abuses of power we\u2019re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,\u201d Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.",

      "And while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.",
      "The senator's call for impeachment followed Noem\u2019s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired \u201cdefensively\u201d against Pretti as he \u201capproached\u201d them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.",
      "During the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.",

      "\u201cThis looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,\u201d Noem said Sunday.",
      "In her call for Noem's impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also \u201cviolated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars\u201d on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.",

      "Before Pretti's death, many Democrats felt the same way about a potential shutdown, lending support in the House to most of the remaining appropriations bills \u2014 with DHS the exception.",
      "House Democrats largely rejected the homeland security portion last week with just a handful joining Republicans to ensure its passage. More than 100 House Democrats called for Noem's impeachment.",
      "The House sent the six funding bills to the Senate as a package, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to strip out the homeland security portion which Democrats are demanding.",
      "Despite the procedural hurdles, Schumer said Sunday that Republicans should work with Democrats to advance the other five bills and rewrite the DHS bill. \u201cThis is the best course of action, and the American people are on our side,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "The path ahead is uncertain. The Senate is not scheduled to return to session until Tuesday, due to the snowstorm. The House plans to be out of session this week and would have to pass the funding package again if it is changed.",
      "Democrats are pushing for policy changes to be added to the homeland security spending bill that would force ICE agents to use warrants for immigration arrests, mandate strengthened training, require agents to identify themselves and have Border Patrol agents stay on the border rather than assisting ICE with immigration raids in the interior of the country.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees homeland security funding, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\" on Sunday that Congress cannot fund a department \u201cthat is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls across the country in violation of the law.\u201d",
      "Democratic senators discussed the options on Sunday evening's call but without changes from Republicans, they appeared headed toward a shutdown. On the morning call with House Democrats, they heard from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and the state\u2019s attorney general, Keith Ellison, both former congressmen.",
      "Several other Democratic senators announced they would vote \u201cno\u201d on homeland security money, including some who had helped Republicans end the record shutdown last year.",
      "\u201cThe abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said in a post on X. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., also said she opposes that portion of the package.",

      "A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis",
      "WASHINGTON -- A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis, a sign that the Trump administration's accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.",
      "House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying \u201cmy top priority remains keeping Americans safe.\u201d",
      "A host of other congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, pressed for more information. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflected a party struggling with how to respond to Saturday\u2019s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a VA hospital.",
      "Trump administration officials were quick to cast Pretti as the instigator. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was among those who said Pretti \u201capproached\u201d immigration officers with a gun and acted violently. Videos from the scene show Pretti being pushed by an officer and then a half-dozen agents descend on him. During the scuffle, he is holding a phone but is never seen brandishing the 9mm semiautomatic handgun police say he was licensed to carry.",
      "The killing has raised uncomfortable questions about the GOP's core positions on issues ranging from gun ownership to states' rights and trust in the federal government.",
      "Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed challenger in his reelection bid, said on social media that the shooting was \u201cincredibly disturbing\u201d and that the \u201ccredibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\u201d He pushed for \u201ca full joint federal and state investigation.\u201d Tillis, who is not seeking reelection, urged a \u201cthorough and impartial investigation\u201d and said \u201cany administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump\u2019s legacy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski called for an investigation and added that \u201cICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.\u201d Collins, the only incumbent Republican senator facing reelection in a state Democrat Kamala Harris carried in 2024, said a probe is needed \u201cto determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.\u201d",
      "While calling for protesters to \u201ckeep space\u201d from law enforcement and not interfere, Collins said federal law enforcement must \"recognize both the public\u2019s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.\u201d",
      "Even Sen. Pete Ricketts, a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, called for a \u201cprioritized, transparent investigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy support for funding ICE remains the same,\u201d the Nebraska Republican, who is up for reelection, said online. \u201cBut we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.\u201d",
      "Trump and other administration officials remained firm in their defense of the hard-line immigration enforcement tactics in Minneapolis, blaming Democrats in the state along with local law enforcement for not working with them. Many Republicans either echoed that sentiment or stayed silent.",
      "In a lengthy social media post on Sunday evening, Trump called on Minnesota's Democratic leadership to \u201cformally cooperate\u201d with his administration and pressed Congress to ban so-called sanctuary cities.",
      "Trump has enjoyed nearly complete loyalty from fellow Republicans during his first year back in the White House. But the positions staked out in the wake of the shooting signal the administration will face at least some pushback within the party in its swift effort to define Pretti, who protested Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, as a violent demonstrator.",
      "Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller issued social media posts referencing an \u201cassassin\u201d and \u201cdomestic terrorist\" while Noem said Pretti showed up to \u201cimpede a law enforcement operation.\u201d",
      "At a minimum, some Republicans are calling for a de-escalation in Minneapolis.",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the shooting was a \u201creal tragedy\u201d and Trump needs to define an \u201cend game.\u201d",
      "\u201cNobody likes the feds coming to their states,\u201d Stitt said. \u201cAnd so what is the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Americans want.\u201d",

      "Pretti's killing comes at a sensitive moment for the GOP as the party prepares for a challenging midterm election year. Trump has fomented a sense of chaos on the world stage, bringing the NATO alliance to the brink last week. Domestically, Trump has struggled to respond to widespread affordability concerns.",
      "Meanwhile, approval of his handling of immigration \u2014 long a political asset for the president and the GOP \u2014 has tumbled. Just 38% of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling immigration in January, down from 49% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll.",
      "The killing spurred notable tension with the GOP's long-standing support for gun rights. Officials say Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos that have surfaced so far appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.",
      "Yet administration officials, including Noem and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have questioned why he was armed. Speaking on ABC's \u201cThis Week\" Bessent said that when he has attended protests, \u201cI didn't bring a gun. I brought a billboard.\u201d",
      "Such comments were notable for a party where support for the Second Amendment's protection of gun ownership is foundational. Indeed, many in the GOP, including Trump, lifted Kyle Rittenhouse into prominence when the then-17-year-old former police youth cadet shot three men, killing two of them, during a 2020 protest in Wisconsin against police brutality. He was acquitted of all charges after testifying that he acted in self defense.",
      "In the wake of Pretti's killing, gun rights advocates noted that it is legal to carry firearms during protests.",
      "\u201cEvery peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms \u2014 including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights,\u201d the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement. \u201cThese rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.\u201d",
      "In a social media post, the National Rifle Association said \u201cresponsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who is often critical of the White House, said \u201ccarrying a firearm is not a death sentence.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhich side do you want to be on?\" Gov. Tim Walz asked the public. \"The side of an all-powerful federal government that could kill, injure, menace and kidnap its citizens off the streets, or on the side of a nurse at the VA hospital who died bearing witness to such government?\u201d \u2014 a reference to Saturday's shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.",
      "In a federal office building about 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino, the public face of the crackdown, again blamed the shooting on Pretti.",

      "The competing comments emerged as local leaders and Democrats across the country demanded federal immigration officers leave Minnesota after Pretti's shooting, which set off clashes with protesters in a city already shaken by another shooting death weeks earlier.",
      "Video shot by bystanders and reviewed by The Associated Press appears to contradict statements by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, which said agents fired \u201cdefensively\u201d against Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, as he approached them.",
      "Pretti can be seen with only a phone in his hand as he steps between an immigration agent and a woman on the street. No footage appears to show him with a weapon. During the scuffle, agents appear to disarm him after discovering he is carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and then open fire several times. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon.",
      "In the hours after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti attacked officers, and Bovino said he wanted to \u201cmassacre law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Bovino was more restrained Sunday, saying he would not speculate about the shooting and that he planned to wait for the investigation.",
      "Pretti\u2019s family said they were \u201cheartbroken but also very angry\u201d at authorities. Relatives were furious at federal officials\u2019 description of the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump\u2019s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand, and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,\u201d the family statement said. \u201cPlease get the truth out about our son.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday we remember that freedom is not free,\u201d Pretti, wearing navy blue scrubs, says in the video. \u201cWe have to work for it, nurture it, protect it, and even sacrifice for it.\u201d",

      "\"And I would say, President Trump, you can end this today. Pull these folks back. Do humane, focused, effective immigration control,\u201d he said.",

Here's a look at how the two Pentagon strategies address some of the traditional concerns of U.S. security policy.",
      "2022: \u201cThe United States derives immense benefit from a stable, peaceful, and democratic Western Hemisphere that reduces security threats to the homeland. To prevent distant threats from becoming a challenge at home, the Department will continue to partner with countries in the region to build capability and promote security and stability.",
      "\u201cAs in all regions, the Department will work collaboratively, seeking to understand our partners\u2019 security needs and areas of mutual concern.\u201d",
      "2026: \u201cWe will actively and fearlessly defend America\u2019s interests throughout the Western Hemisphere. We will guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland. We will provide President Trump with credible military options to use against narco-terrorists wherever they may be. We will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests. And where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "2022: \u201cThe Department will maintain its bedrock commitment to NATO collective security, working alongside Allies and partners to deter, defend, and build resilience against further Russian military aggression and acute forms of gray zone coercion. As we continue contributing to NATO capabilities and readiness \u2014 including through improvements to our posture in Europe and our extended nuclear deterrence commitments \u2014 the Department will work with Allies bilaterally and through NATO\u2019s established processes to better focus NATO capability development and military modernization to address Russia\u2019s military threat.\u201d",
      "2026: \u201cRussia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO\u2019s eastern members for the foreseeable future.\u201d",
      "\u201cEuropean NATO dwarfs Russia in economic scale, population, and, thus, latent military power.

It follows that, although we are and will remain engaged in Europe, we must \u2014 and will \u2014 prioritize defending the U.S. Homeland and deterring China.\u201d",
      "\u201cFortunately, our NATO allies are substantially more powerful than Russia \u2014 it is not even close. Germany\u2019s economy alone dwarfs that of Russia. At the same time, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, NATO allies have committed to raise defense spending to the new global standard of 5% of GDP in total, with 3.5% of GDP invested in hard military capabilities. Our NATO allies are therefore strongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe\u2019s conventional defense, with critical but more limited U.S. support. This includes taking the lead in supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe most comprehensive and serious challenge to U.S. national security is the PRC\u2019s coercive and increasingly aggressive endeavor to refashion the Indo-Pacific region and the international system to suit its interests and authoritarian preferences.\"",
      "\"The PRC\u2019s increasingly provocative rhetoric and coercive activity towards Taiwan are destabilizing, risk miscalculation, and threaten the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.

That is why the NSS (National Security Strategy) directs DoW (Department of War) to maintain a favorable balance of military power in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "\"Not for purposes of dominating, humiliating, or strangling China. To the contrary, our goal is far more scoped and reasonable than that: It is simply to ensure that neither China nor anyone else can dominate us or our allies.

      "2022: \u201cThe Department will continue to deter attacks through forward posture; integrated air and missile defense; close coordination and interoperability with our ROK (South Korea) Ally; nuclear deterrence; resilience initiatives; and the potential for direct cost imposition approaches that come from globally deployable Joint Forces.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Department will prioritize cooperation with our regional and global partners that results in their increased ability to deter and defend against potential aggression from Iran, for example by working to advance integrated air and missile defense, maritime security, and irregular warfare capabilities.

As we do, DoW will maintain our ability to take focused, decisive action to defend U.S. interests.\u201d",

    "summary": "As the face of Revlon, Lauren Hutton \u2013 called a \"believable beauty\" \u2013 became the highest-paid model in history, and still holds the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue. She talks about her adventurous life of no regrets.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Hutton was told again and again in the 1960s that she wasn't cut out to be a model. She recalled being told, \"'You've got that space between your teeth, your eyes are crossed a lotta the times. I had improper \u2026 everything.'\"",
      "While the gap in her teeth was sometimes visible, in the beginning she was discouraged from showing it. \"I had to buy a little $300 plastic thing that went there, that I would sneeze out and lose,\" she said.",
      "She still owns the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue: 26. And at 82, she still has that smile.",
      "Asked how she feels having been the first supermodel, Hutton said, \"Yeah, certainly, if it was about money. And I changed the whole money system.\"",
      "In 1973, Revlon signed her to an exclusive deal for a quarter of a million dollars a year, then the biggest contract in modeling history.",
      "Coming from college in New Orleans, she saw New York as a gateway to the world and to the wild places she wanted to visit. Ask her about modeling, and somehow you'll almost always end up in Africa: \"I lived with pygmies, and I lived with Karamojong, and I lived with Kalahari bushmen,\" she said. \"You're constantly excited. You're constantly thrilled. And everything's beautiful. My life was none of this stuff. My life was traveling. That's the only reason I came to New York.\"",
      "\"You never really wanted to be a model?\" I asked.",
      "\"Never heard of it!\"",
      "\"In so many ways, it was all an accident.\"",
      "\"Amen! Amen!\" Hutton replied. \"I've always been lucky. I was born lucky.\"",
      "A \"believable\" beauty",
      "She was born Mary Laurence Hutton in Charleston, South Carolina, during World War II. Her dad was an Army pilot overseas: \"He wrote me every single day from the war. And my mother, very kindly and beautifully, put it into books for me.\"",
      "Her parents split in 1945. Lauren grew up in Florida with an abusive stepfather. So, she treasured her father's letters: \"'Cause I wanted my daddy bad,\" she said.",
      "But she never met him. \"No. No. But he gave me a love, enough love in those letters that held me all this time, and made me love men!\" she laughed.",
      "Hutton made her screen debut in 1963 as a decoy contestant on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth,\" while working as a \"Bunny\" at the Playboy Club in New York City. But at the beginning she was turned down by five modeling agencies.",
      "Eileen Ford, who'd call Hutton a \"believable\" beauty, finally gave her a shot, later admitting, \"I still don't know what made me take her.\"",
      "Hutton was sent to see the legendary editor of Vogue, Diana Vreeland, a meeting Hutton described as \"heaven.\" \"And she said, 'You!' And I looked, and she had pointed this long, beautiful finger at me. And she said, 'You have quite a presence.' I had no idea what that was. What was a presence? But I took a chance, and I said, 'Well, you sure do!'\"",
      "Vreeland quickly connected her with one of Vogue's top photographers, Richard Avedon. \"And he made wonderful \u2013 they're still some of the best pictures I ever took,\" Hutton said.",
      "Avedon and Hutton became frequent collaborators. Soon she was the hottest model in the country, and a household name. Artist Robert Rauschenberg, a friend and neighbor, created a collage portrait of her. Hutton landed film roles, too, in \"Paper Lion\" with Alan Alda; \"The Gambler\" with James Caan; and \"American Gigolo\" with Richard Gere.",
      "I asked, \"For someone who didn't want to be a model, or an actress, you turn out to be really good at it. And you seem to not only understand how to do it, but you seemed to figure out the economics of it?\"",
      "\"Twice. I did that twice,\" Hutton said. \"'Cause Bob lost all the first bunch.\"",
      "\"Bob\" was Bob Williamson, for nearly three decades her boyfriend, father figure, and financial manager. Hutton said, \"You'd hear all those girls say, 'Well, my sweetheart's in high finance. What is yours in?' I'd say, 'Low finance.' And I was right!\"",
      "They travelled the world together, until she discovered he'd lost nearly $13 million of her money. \"Bob was very, very smart about all kinds of stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"But he also lost all your money?\"",
      "\"Yeah. But you know what? I'd do it again in a second,\" Hutton said.",
      "She went back to fashion and earned her fortune all over again. \"I just kept on plugging at it,\" she said.",
      "Resilience is a recurring theme in Hutton's life. In 2000, a motorcycle accident knocked her 20 feet into the air: \"I can remember every second of it, and it was really sort of rapturous.\"",
      "She'd been riding to Las Vegas with a group of friends that included Jeremy Irons and Dennis Hopper, and was badly hurt: \"Oh, I was dead, and I wasn't breathing at all. Those boys saved me. My gang, my guys saved my life. My wingmen! Don't make me start crying!\"",
      "But the cover girl came back from that, too.",
      "Lauren Hutton has never regretted an adventure. \"I was not there to see myself on the stands,\" she said. \"I was there to get the money to go see the world. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 09:39:52 -0500",
    "summary": "In her choice of media, sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) employed a resourcefulness that stemmed from her early years on a farm \u2013 and in a WWII detention camp for Japanese Americans. She's now the subject of a retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "Artist Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain, in the city's Union Square, is an endless treasure trove of Bay Area knowledge. \"Some people refer to it as sort of a Where's Waldo?, because there are so many things to find,\" said her son, Paul Lanier. \"You can find Willie Mays, the San Francisco Giants, the opera, city hall, the library.\"",
      "It's just one of Asawa's eleven public works in the city, and a reminder to Paul Lanier and his sister, Addie Lanier \u2013 the youngest of her six children \u2013 of their mother's commitment to community, and her ability to make art out of anything. \"She said that she would be fulfilled making something out of mud and paper, because it's the process that is the important thing for the artist,\" said Addie.",
      "Asawa, who would have turned 100 this year, is best known for her looped wire structures, a continuous line of wire bent and woven to create a free-hanging sculpture. Addie said, \"The media that she worked in is very economical. It's industrial wire. It's like the baling wire that you would find on a farm.\"",
      "Asawa learned to be resourceful from a young age, finding materials everywhere. Her media ranged from baker's clay in the kitchen, to recycled paper.",
      "Asked what she was like as a mom, Paul replied, \"Well, she's just like your mom, or anyone's mom, making lunches and breakfast, getting people out of the house.\"",
      "\"But she used blow torches on the front deck!\" laughed Addie.",
      "Asawa spent her early years on a farm in Southern California, working alongside her parents. Her childhood was cut short during World War II when she (along with other Japanese-Americans) was sent to a detention camp \u2013 incarcerated along with more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent under Executive Order 9066.",
      "There, in the face of incredible adversity, she first learned to draw. Cara Manes, the curator of a Ruth Asawa retrospective now on view at New York's Museum of Modern Art, said Asawa attended \"grassroots drawing lessons that were led by fellow detainees who were animators for the Disney Studios.\"",
      "After the war, Asawa landed at North Carolina's famed arts school Black Mountain College, where she honed her skills with mentors like German-born artist Josef Albers and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",
      ", Her dynamic sculptures appear to have a life of their own. \"They're really animated,\" said Manes, \"and they change as you move around them.\"",
      "A special aspect of Asawa's work is its unpredictable rhythm. Manes said, \"Sometimes by looking at the shadow cast by a given sculpture, you can understand how many layers of wire mesh there is, you know, in a way that you might not be able to discern from head-on.\"",
      "Everyone could become art in Asawa's home, according to her children. Paul said, \"If someone came over she would say, 'You have such a nice face. Can I cast it?' And so they would say yes. They didn't know what they were agreeing to!\"",
      "\"But she could get away with it,\" Addie said. \"She could do this with total strangers.\"",
      "While her works fetch millions at auction now, Asawa didn't find much commercial success during her lifetime. But that wasn't her purpose, say her children.",
      "Asked what she hopes people discover from her mother's work, Addie replied, \"I think people breathe. I think people take a big, deep breath and go, 'Oh my God.' I think it's, like, wonder and awe to see that something like this exists, that was made by hand. It's kind of the experiment of what one person can do. You are that experiment. Go forth. Do something with your life, you know? Learn a technique, do something, pass it on, right?\"",

      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice. Yet SeatGeek data suggests that Heated Rivalry, which stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie, has driven a \"noticeable spike\" in demand for NHL tickets and revenue for the league, according to the ticket seller.",
      "The mobile ticketing company said it saw weekly hockey ticket sales rise more than 20% after the show first aired.",
      "\"When HBO released 'Heated Rivalry' earlier this winter, the series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,\" SeatGeek\u00a0said in an analysis of ticket sales through its platform.",

There's also a lineup of documentaries whose subjects include singers Courtney Love and Marianne Faithfull, tennis legend Billie Jean King, author Salman Rushdie, and topics like artificial intelligence, summitting K2, and children competing to sell the most Girl Scout cookies.",
      "The festival's screenings will be held in-person in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, while online screenings will be accessible for audiences across the country beginning Jan. 29. There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",
      "There are also Audience Awards, which in the past have gone to such films as \"sex, lies and videotape,\" \"Hoop Dreams,\" \"Whale Rider,\" \"Hustle & Flow,\" \"Once,\" \"Searching for Sugar Man,\" \"Fruitvale Station,\" \"Whiplash,\" \"CODA,\" and \"20 Days in Mariupol.\"",

      "Art and media are the focus of several films: \"Public Access\" traces the history of the development of public access television, as it grew from a legally-required offering on New York City cable TV in the early 1970s, to a controversial battleground for free speech. \"Seized\" recounts the story of a newspaper in the small town of Marion, Kansas, that was raided by police, unearthing a deeper story about abuse of power, community journalism, and the fact that \"deleted\" text messages aren't necessarily gone forever.",
      "\"Once Upon a Time in Harlem\" brings to life footage captured by the late filmmaker William Greaves when he documented a 1972 gathering of the living luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Mark Cousins' \"The Story of Documentary Film\" looks at the evolution of non-fiction cinema.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "summary": "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified in his lawsuit against the Daily Mail's publisher.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"CBS Mornings\" exclusively revealed the star-studded roster of 2026 inductees to the Songwriters Hall of Fame, celebrating artists whose work has left a lasting mark on music history, with some making history themselves.",
      "At 36 years old, Taylor Swift has become the youngest woman by nearly a decade to be bestowed with the honor. Swift is joining a long list of legends in the coveted Hall of Fame.",
      "Here are this year's new inductees, many of whom have written the soundtrack to our lives.",

      "Meet the members",
      "Leading the class of 2026 is Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley, who came together in 1973 to form the unlikely creative partnership that became KISS.",
      "\"No, I didn't like [Simmons] at all. There's days he annoys me now,\" joked Stanley in a 2014 interview with CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason.",
      "But the two Jewish New Yorkers bonded over their backgrounds and shared work ethic. With Stanley, Simmons said, \"One and one is three.\"",
      "Next is Christopher \"Tricky Stewart,\" who co-wrote and co-produced Beyonc\u00e9's blockbuster hit \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).\" Raised in a musical family in Markham, Illinois, Stewart was writing songs by age 12.",
      "His big break came in 2007, with what he calls the \"single most important song\" he's ever written: Rihanna's \"Umbrella.\" He once told MTV about the song's success, \"When she recorded the 'ellas,' you knew your life was about to change if you had anything to do with that record.\"",
      "You oughta know the next artist on the list: Alanis Morissette.",
      "Morissette's breakup anthem, \"You Oughta Know,\" was written from what she described as fractured devastation. With her blistering lyrics, the Canadian singer set off a cultural earthquake. Her 1995 album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" sold 33 million copies worldwide.",
      "\"When I write songs, everything that jumps to the fore \u2013 lyrically and musically \u2013 is that which I have sublimated or repressed. So, it's all my unconscious writing,\" she told \"CBS Mornings\" featured host Vladimir Duthiers in November.",
      "Other Hall of Famers, Terry Britten and Graham Lyle helped lift Tina Turner from soul singer to superstar, writing many of Turner's greatest hits, including \"What's Love Got To Do With It\" and \"We Don't Need Another Hero.\"",
      "Britten also wrote many hits for Cliff Richard, like \"Devil Woman.\" Meanwhile, Lyle \u2013 and his bandmate Benny Gallagher \u2013 wrote \"A Heart in New York,\" famously performed at Simon & Garfunkel's 1981 concert in Central Park.",
      "Kenny Loggins' songwriting career has had many chapters, from performing in the 70s with Jim Messina to going solo to writing with Michael McDonald. In the 80s, he became the king of soundtracks with music featured in \"Caddyshack,\" \"Footloose\" and \"Top Gun.\"",
      "\"There's just a part of my brain that's kind of scoring everything,\" Loggins said in a 2022 PBS interview.",
      "Then there's Walter Afanasieff, who co-wrote and co-produced Mariah Carey's No. 1 smash, \"Hero.\" And then again, for the holiday classic, \"All I Want For Christmas is You.\"",
      "\"We'd play musical ping pong,\" he's said of his more than 11-year collaboration with Carey.",
      "Raised in San Francisco, Afanasieff played keys with Narada Michael Walden, co-writing a James Bond theme for Gladys Knight.",
      "Last but not least, there's Taylor Swift.",
      "Since signing a publishing deal at 14 years old, Swift has gone on to land 69 songs in the Top 10. Thirteen of those - her favorite number - have hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Swift's newest album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day in 2025.",
      "In a 2019 interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Swift said many of her songs are written overnight, when inspiration unexpectedly strikes",
      "\"It's usually in the middle of the night. Or if I'm trying to get to sleep and I can't and then I get an idea. And I'm, like, 'Well, I'm not tired anyway!' And then kind of wander over here,\" she told correspondent Tracy Smith, gesturing to her piano.",

    "summary": "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail during a detention hearing on child sex abuse charges.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has ordered that actor Timothy Busfield be released from jail as he awaits trial on child sex abuse charges.",
      "The order Tuesday, by state district court Judge David Murphy during a detention hearing, is linked to accusations that Busfield inappropriately touched a minor while working as a director on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "The judge ordered that the defendant be released on his own recognizance, pending trial. Busfield will be supervised upon release by a pretrial service in Albuquerque, and can leave the state to live at home, the judge said. Under the conditions of his release, Busfield cannot be in possession of firearms or drugs and can't have contact with the alleged victims.",
      "Busfield, an Emmy Award-winning actor who is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" was ordered held without bond last week at his first court appearance. Busfield called the allegations lies in a video shared before he turned himself in.",
      "At the hearing Tuesday, Busfield was handcuffed and dressed in an orange jail uniform in a New Mexico state district court, while wife and actor Melissa Gilbert watched from the court gallery.",
      "Gilbert was tearful while exiting the courtroom after the judge ordered Busfield's release.",
      "Gilbert, who played Laura Ingalls in the 1970s to '80s TV series \"Little House on the Prairie,\" is on the list of potential witnesses submitted ahead of the hearing.",
      "Albuquerque police issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest earlier this month on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported Busfield touched him on private areas over his clothing on one occasion when he was 7 years old and another time when he was 8. The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield, but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "On Monday, Busfield's attorneys submitted two brief audio recordings of initial police interviews in which the children say Busfield did not touch them in private areas. The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",
      "Legal experts say New Mexico is among a few states that allow polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but a judge has final say over whether one can be used. There are strict requirements for admission.",

    "story": [
      "\"Queer Eye\" star Karamo Brown was notably absent from Tuesday's \"CBS Mornings\" live interview with the full cast as they promoted the release of the series' 10th and final season, citing a need to prioritize his mental health.",
      "Roughly an hour before the interview, Brown's assistant informed \"CBS Mornings\" that the cast member wouldn't be joining the on-set interview due to mental health concerns and, in part, because he was worried about being bullied.",
      "In a statement released to \"CBS Mornings\" explaining his absence, Brown said, \"Thank you to everyone around the world for welcoming me into their homes for 10 seasons. Season 10 is amazing and I know you will fall in love with the deserving people we helped.\"",
      "It continued, \"Though the show is ending, I hope everyone remembers the main theme I have tried to teach them over the past decade, which is to focus on and to protect their mental health/peace from people or a world who seek to destroy it; which is why I can't be there today. Thank you to the crew for being the best in business and the executives for believing in me. 10 Seasons, I'm truly humbled.\"",
      "Brown is part of the Fab Five, which includes Tan France, Jonathan Van Ness, Antoni Porowski and Jeremiah Brent, who joined the cast on season nine of the show. Brent replaced interior designer Bobby Berk, who left the show after eight seasons.",
      "\"Queer Eye\" cast addresses Brown's absence",
      "Porowski said \"surprise is a fair understatement,\" referring to Brown's absence after listening to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King read his statement.",
      "\"I will say our 'Queer Eye' family, we have been doing this for almost a decade, which is pretty wild to believe, and families are complicated. We're definitely not excluded from that,\" Porowski said.",
      "Van Ness said he's honored to have learned from Brown during their time together on the show.",
      "\"He has taught people to center what they need and I'm actually really proud of him. Center what you need. Do the things you need to take care of you. I'd be lying if I didn't feel like that sometimes,\" Van Ness said. \"And so, I think it's really beautiful, and I think we do need to center what is best for us sometimes and my hat off to him for doing that today.\"",
      "Brent called his experience with the group transformative, saying, \"I have felt safe and supported by the people up here. I have loved every second of this thing and I'm so excited that we get to do this and share this next season because the show really is just about highlighting the best of humanity.\"",
      "10th and final season",
      "In the very first episode of the series, France said they were working toward acceptance, but as the show comes to a close, he revealed he isn't sure that's happened yet.",
      "\"I would love to believe that we have come around to that, but as we've seen, especially over the last year or so, that hasn't been the case here in particular in the U.S. I pray we will continue to fight for acceptance but it is not just ours,\" France said. \"It is our entire nation's responsibility at this point to fight for those who can't fight for themselves.\"",
      "But the cast members agreed the show has had a massive impact on their lives.",
      "\"It has really given me hope for what this country has been and can be again,\" France said. \"It helps me to understand the way our country operates through the heroes that we've helped.\"",
      "\"It's just opened my eyes to so much,\" Van Ness added, reflecting on his time on the series. \"At the end of the day people want to be safe. They want to be loved and accepted by their family. Sometimes that's not possible so they have a chosen family around them. I think we are so much more similar than we are different.\"",
      "For Porowski, \"Queer Eye\" has changed him as a person as he looks at future projects.",
      "\"I think it has for all us in how we want to, the type of stories that we want to tell and even more importantly, other people, hopefully it inspires them to kind of push towards embracing diversity,\" he said.",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

      "Based on bets placed through Monday, the implied consensus snowfall for New York City's total was 11 inches. The official outcome has yet to be determined, and bettors won't cash out \u2014 or notch losses \u2014 until totals for the three days between Jan. 24 and Jan. 26 are released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, according to the market's description on the site.",

    "story": [
      "Bank of America is weighing whether to launch a new credit card that would comply with President Trump's push to temporarily cap card\u00a0interest rates at 10%, according to a person familiar with the financial giant's plans.",
      "Bank of America already offers credit cards with initial average percentage rates below 10%. For example, its no-frills BankAmericard offers consumers a 0% introductory APR for 18 months. Once that period ends, however, the APR rises to between 14.5% and 24%, depending on the cardholder's credit score.",
      "In a social media post, Mr. Trump earlier this month called for a 10% cap on credit card rates for one year, accusing credit card issuers of having \"ripped off\" consumers for years by charging interest rates of up to 30% for customers carrying balances.",
      "But the Trump administration has yet to provide more details on the proposal, including how it would be enforced, leaving banking executives unclear on what compliance with such an interest rate limit would entail.",
      "Credit card debt has been rising for decades, ebbing after the 2008 financial crisis and later during the COVID-19 pandemic, only to swell to a record high last year. As of the third quarter of 2025, Americans had outstanding credit card balances of $1.2 trillion, up nearly 6% from a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Including both their bank and store credit cards, consumers owe an average of nearly $7,900 on their cards, according to LendingTree.",
      "Banking industry pushback",

      "Speaking at the annual\u00a0World Economic Forum conclave in Davos, Switzerland, this week, Mr. Trump said he plans to work with Congress to deliver credit card interest relief for Americans. The Trump administration has not detailed how it might penalize credit card issuers that fail to comply with Mr. Trump's directive.",
      "The banking industry has criticized Mr. Trump's proposed cap, saying it could hurt consumers by reducing their access to credit and steering them toward riskier lending products. Reduced consumer spending would cut into economic growth, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"We believe Treasury Secretary [Scott] Bessent understands how this could limit credit card lending and expose banks to risk. Both could hurt the economy,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a report. \"We expect he will quietly push back to ensure there is not a 10% cap, though a higher cap is possible.\"",
      "Despite the banking industry's opposition to a cap, card issuers are exploring possible solutions that align with Mr. Trump's push to ease the cost of credit, a financial industry source familiar with Bank of America's plans told CBS News.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:46:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Only one in four Americans has a credit score above 800, which is considered exceptional, according to industry data.",
    "story": [
      "Achieving a credit score of 800 or higher can help unlock the lowest interest rates for products ranging from auto loans to credit cards, but only one in four Americans has managed to reach that level, according to credit bureau Experian.",
      "Lenders typically view scores above 800 as \"exceptional,\" a signal that a borrower consistently pays bills on time and manages debt responsibly. Most banks rely on the FICO score, developed by Fair Isaac Corp., which ranges from 300 to a maximum of 850, to assess a consumer's creditworthiness.",
      "Hitting that 800-point milestone may be more critical in 2026 than ever before.",
      "The new urgency stems from President Trump's recent push for a 10%\u00a0cap on credit card interest rates. While the proposal aims to save consumers money, industry trade groups such as the Electronic Payments Coalition warn that a cap could lead lenders to reduce credit limits or even cancel cards for borrowers with credit scores below 740.",
      "\"Credit scores are really far-reaching in our financial lives. It's a part of the puzzle a lender uses to determine whether or not to lend to you, whether it's a credit card, personal loan, mortgage or beyond,\" \u00a0Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, a personal finance firm that offers free credit scores, told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"Anyone applying for credit should take every step they can to improve their score to get the lowest interest rates from lenders.\"",
      "What's a good credit score?",
      "Here's the range of credit scores and the share of consumers in each tranche, according to credit bureau Experian:",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%Fair (580-669): 14.9%Good (670-739): 20.4%Very good (740-799): 27.5%Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%",
      "Fair (580-669): 14.9%",
      "Good (670-739): 20.4%",
      "Very good (740-799): 27.5%",
      "Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Only 2% of Americans have achieved the top FICO score of 850, Experian says. But you don't need to have a perfect score to get better rates from lenders, financial experts note.",
      "A credit score in the high 600s or above 700 is considered good, according to Matt Schulz, a personal finance expert at online lending marketplace LendingTree.",
      "\"The higher you can get above 700, the better you are,\" he said.",
      "Cynthia Chen, CEO of Kikoff, a financial technology company that helps people build credit, said that any score above 760 can unlock access to the best credit products.",
      "How can I boost my score to 800?",
      "According to Experian, your FICO score is determined by five key factors, each carrying a different weight:",
      "Payment history: 35%Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%Length of credit history: 15%Credit mix: 10%Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Payment history: 35%",
      "Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%",
      "Length of credit history: 15%",
      "Credit mix: 10%",
      "Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Because payment history is the most impactful of these factors, accounting for 35% of your total credit score, experts emphasize that consistently paying accounts on time is the single most important step you can take.",
      "Indeed, a single late payment to your credit card issuer could knock off 50 or more points from your credit score, according to Schulz.",
      "To avoid making any late payments, Schulz and other experts recommend automating bill payment, although they stress that it's still important to monitor bills for mistakes and to ensure that the payments are actually made.",
      "\"That takes some pressure off of you,\" Schulz said.",
      "Keep your balance low",
      "If you can't pay your bill in full when it comes due, try to keep the balance, or your credit utilization rate, as low as possible.",
      "Your utilization rate measures how much of your available credit you've used. For example, if you made a $1,500 purchase with a $2,000 credit limit, your credit utilization rate would be quite high, at 75%. High credit utilization can take points off your score because lenders could see it as a signal of financial risk.",
      "\"Just because you can borrow up to a certain amount doesn't mean you should. When it comes to credit cards, you should only be borrowing what you can pay off in full at the end of the month,\" financial consultant Steve Azoury, owner of Michigan-based Azoury Financial, told CBS News.",
      "According to\u00a0Experian, people with exceptional credit scores, in the 800 to 850 range, have an average credit utilization rate of just over 7%.",
      "Alev of Credit Karma encourages consumers to aim to keep their rates below 10%. People with utilization rates above 30% can see \"meaningful negative implications\" on their credit scores, she said.",
      "While keeping your credit utilization low won't guarantee a top credit score, it is one of the most heavily weighted components.",
      "Limit applications for credit",
      "Avoid applying for too much credit, too often. Whenever you apply for new credit, a lender pulls your credit file or runs a so-called hard inquiry on your credit report, which affects your score.",
      "Each hard inquiry can knock off roughly five points from your credit score, meaning that multiple inquiries in a short period of time can have a large impact, according to Experian.",
      "Build a credit history",
      "The length of consumers' credit histories factors into their FICO scores, too. More than half of the people with 800-plus credit scores are older than 60, according to Experian, in part because they have established long track records of paying their bills on time.",
      "One way for a relatively new account holder to quickly build a credit history and demonstrate consistent payment behavior is to set recurring subscriptions, such as streaming plans or gym memberships, to autopay.",
      "\"If you pay it every single month, that builds payment history. You don't need to put a lot of charges on a card, but you need to show that behavior of consistent, on-time payments,\" Alev told CBS News.",
      "Kikoff's Chen said that consumers with only a few months of credit history should not expect to achieve a score of 800 or above right away, as all borrowers start with relatively low scores that take time to build.",
      "\"Scoring models want you to demonstrate your creditworthiness over the long term,\" she said. \"They need history to get to that level of comfort.\"",
      "Mix up your credit types",
      "Managing a variety of credit types, such as credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, can help boost your credit score.",
      "\"Credit mix is important because a lender wants to know how you do with different types of credit, and not just a personal loan or a credit card,\" Chen of Kikoff said. \"If you have a mortgage or an auto loan, the credit scoring model gives you points for that.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Sales of Tesla's electric Cybertruck fell 48% in 2025, new data shows.",
      "Tesla sold 20,237 Cybertrucks in 2025, down from 38,965 the previous year, according to figures from Kelley Blue Book's annual electric vehicle (EV)\u00a0sales reports.",
      "Other Tesla models also struggled to entice buyers, with sales of the automaker's X, S and Y vehicles all falling year-over-year. Tesla's Model 3 was the only vehicle in its lineup to see stronger demand, with sales rising to 192,440, up 1.3% from 2024, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Tesla cited \"uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy\" as some of the headwinds it was facing in a presentation\u00a0last year. The company remains the dominant seller of electric vehicles in the U.S., accounting for around 46% in 2025.",
      "\"It's been an uphill battle for sales, but a long demand curve ahead,\" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In January, the company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Tesla has been eclipsed by China's BYD as the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla isn't the only EV maker to see weaker sales. Across the auto industry, electric vehicle sales last year totaled roughly 1.3 million, a 2% drop from 2024.",
      "One obstacle is affordability, given that electric cars remain generally pricier than gas-powered vehicles. As of November, the average price of a new EV was $58,638, versus less than $50,000 for conventional cars,\u00a0according to Cox Automotive.",
      "The tax and spending bill passed by Congress last year also eliminated tax credits for both new and used EVs, which critics warned could make the cars unaffordable for many people.",
      "Multiple recalls",
      "Tesla launched the futuristic-looking steel Cybertruck in 2023 at a starting price of $60,990. At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk touted them as the strongest pickup truck on the road, able to tow 11,000 pounds.",
      "However, the trucks have faced a rash of mechanical and other problems. Last year, Tesla recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks over an issue with the trim panel, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said could detach from the vehicle and pose a risk to other drivers.",
      "The vehicle has also faced recalls for issues with its rearview camera, windshield wipers and\u00a0accelerator pedals.",
      "Cybertrucks also became a flashpoint in the debate over Musk's role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. In a sign of protest,\u00a0some people vandalized Cybertrucks at Tesla dealerships.",
      "Catalysts for growth",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock price has performed well, rising rougly 9% to $450.39 over the last 12 months. Ives expects the carmaker's strength in self-driving technology and so-called robotaxis to drive growth.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts also have high hopes for a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, that Tesla is developing and expects to roll out commercially over the next year. Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, Musk said Thursday that Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks\" at Tesla plants.",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" he said.",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",

    "summary": "Cold weather can reduce the efficiency of electric vehicles, shortening their driving range. These tips can help.",
    "story": [
      "With temperatures plunging in some states as a\u00a0massive winter storm bears down across the U.S., some electric vehicle owners could face a cold, hard truth: EVs can lose efficiency in low temperatures, curtailing their driving ranges.",
      "The issue drew widespread attention in January 2024, when some Chicago-area Tesla owners found their EVs' batteries had died in subzero temperatures. Other EV owners have posted online about their vehicles' shorter ranges in winter.",
      "Cold weather can slow an EV battery's chemical and physical reactions, reducing vehicle power. And unlike conventional cars with an internal combustion engine, an EV can't tap its motor's heat to warm the interior. Instead, EVs must tap their batteries to provide cabin heat, which can sap their range, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "At 16 degrees Fahrenheit, EVs lose about 25% of their range when driving at about 70 mph, versus their range when driving at the same speed in mid-60-degree temperatures, Consumer Reports found in road testing.",
      "EV owners could be tested this weekend as extreme cold temperatures spread across the U.S., along with freezing rain, snow and rain. Thermometers in the\u00a0Minneapolis area\u00a0plunged to 21 degrees below zero on Friday morning, with wind chills making it feel even colder.",
      "Temperatures through the weekend are expected to sink to record lows across parts of the Southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic states.",
      "Are newer EVs better at handling the cold?",
      "Car manufacturers have made some changes that mean newer EVs perform better in cold temperatures, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, an industry trade group.",
      "Newer EVs have heat pumps and better battery encasements that can help improve battery efficiency, ZETA noted. South Korean automaker Kia says that its new EV models include advanced heat pumps, which extract heat from the outside air, even in cold weather, and transfer it to the cabin, leaving the EV with more energy available for driving.",
      "Other EVs with heat pumps include the Acura ZDX and Volvo EX40, according to a list\u00a0published by electric-vehicle research firm Recurrent.",
      "How do EV owners in cold-weather places cope?",
      "Subzero weather isn't a deterrent for drivers in countries with cold climates \u2014 that includes Norway, where EVs accounted for 96% of all new\u00a0car sales last year.",
      "Drivers in cold regions have learned how to minimize the impact of frigid weather on their EVs by following these tips:",
      "Precondition the battery.

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

    "summary": "JPMorgan Chase says President Trump's lawsuit \"has no merit.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump sued JPMorgan Chase Bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon for $5 billion in Florida, Thursday, alleging that the bank had closed his accounts in 2021 \"as a result of political and social motivations.\"",
      "The suit, filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County, claims that Mr. Trump and his hospitality companies \"suffered considerable financial harm and losses\" in early 2021 when he and his companies were debanked, because of what the suit called JPMorgan Chase's \"woke beliefs.\" Debanking occurs when financial institutions refuse to work with individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers, Alejandro Brito, alleged the debanking had a \"devastating impact\" on the ability of Mr. Trump and his businesses to transact and access assets, and caused \"extensive reputational harm by being forced to reach out to other financial institutions in an effort to move their funds and accounts, making it clear that they had been debanked by JPMC.\" The president's companies were given notice in February 2021 they should take their business elsewhere, the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit also alleges that Mr. Trump, his family, and businesses were blacklisted by the bank. It claims JPMorgan Chase urged other financial institutions \"to not carry on business relationships,\" with them, forcing the Trumps and their businesses to accept a \"limited menu of options and less advantageous terms\" at other banks.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said the suit is meritless.",
      "\"While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,\" a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. \"We respect the president's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves \u2014 that's what courts are for.\"",
      "\"JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons,\" the bank added. \"We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so. We have been asking both this administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking sector.\"",
      "The suit was filed the same day the president left the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Dimon also spoke.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the threat of a lawsuit over the weekend. On Saturday, he said in a post on Truth Social, \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"",
      "Debanking has been a focus for the administration for months. In August, the president signed an executive order that alleged that \"financial institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals' and businesses' access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\" It also directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to investigate the matter.",
      "The OCC's preliminary report, issued in December, said it had found early evidence that nine of the biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 had improperly refused to do business with a range of industries. The six-page report did not identify clients who had been debanked or the institutions alleged to have engaged in the practice.",
      "\"While the OCC is releasing preliminary findings, its work continues to better understand the full extent and effect of these actions and their impact on affected industries and the American economy,\" the comptroller of the currency said in a statement. \"The OCC is also still reviewing thousands of complaints to identify instances of political and religious debanking, which it will report on in due course and as appropriate.\"",

    "summary": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicts that first-quarter economic growth will heat up to 5%. But sustaining that pace won't be easy, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Trump administration officials are forecasting a boom for the U.S. economy in 2026, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and historically large tax refunds.",
      "\"This quarter \u2014 the first quarter of 2026 \u2014 the United States of America's $30 trillion economy will exceed 5% growth,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox Business on Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. By the end of 2026, he added, \"You're going to see 6% growth from the United States of America.\"",
      "That would mark the fastest economic growth since late 2021, when the economy grew at a blistering 7% annual pace after many businesses started reopening during the pandemic. Outside of a few post-pandemic statistical outliers, economic activity in the U.S. has historically moved at a far more measured pace, typically averaging between 2% and 3% per quarter on an annualized basis.",
      "As outlined by Lutnick, the U.S. economy could get a lift this year if President Trump appoints a new Federal Reserve chair more inclined to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate, a move that could spur growth. Consumers could also have more money in their pockets from larger tax refunds under the Republicans' tax and spending law, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's possible \u2014 I would say it's even likely on a one-off basis,\" Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at financial services company Truist, told CBS News of Mr. Lutnick's forecast. But he added that maintaining that growth for a full year is \"a really tough hill to climb.\"",
      "That's because a number of economic headwinds are likely to persist into 2026 and could blunt any lift from lower borrowing costs and larger tax refunds, Skordeles said. Those include trade tensions stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, as well as business uncertainty driven by the administration's shifting economic policies.",
      "\"Those are not positives for the economy,\" Skordeles told CBS News. \"One of those reasons why we're not growing faster is uncertainty.\"",
      "Truist forecasts 2.3% economic growth for all of 2026, while projections by other Wall Street economists range from 2% to 2.5%.",
      "A White House official pointed out that Lutnick's forecast is in line with the Atlanta Fed's forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%.",
      "Risk of overheating",
      "The latest readings on the U.S. economy show a jump in growth, with third-quarter GDP expanding at a 4.3% annualized rate, according to recent government data.",
      "On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy is \"likely accelerating,\" citing an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tool that pegs fourth-quarter GDP growth at 5.4%. The Commerce Department will announce fourth-quarter growth data on Feb. 20.",
      "Yet there are risks to boosting the economy through interest-rate cuts and bigger tax refunds. Those same catalysts contributed to the searing inflation that drove the Consumer Price Index to a 40-year high in 2022.",
      "\"What the secretary was intimating earlier today, to me, that doesn't unlock a bunch of growth \u2014 it unlocks a bunch of inflation,\" Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at Groundworks, a liberal-leaning think tank.",
      "Inflation still isn't down to the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate, with the December CPI showing that prices rose at a 2.7% annualized rate. Food prices remain elevated, rising at an annual pace of 3.1% last month due to sharply higher costs of staples like beef and coffee.",
      "\"It's not a single silver bullet that if we just lowered the [Fed's interest] rate, it would make everything magically better,\" Skordeles said. \"You start giving these tax incentives, and you put more money in people's pockets \u2014 it's the classic 'too many dollars chasing too few goods'.\"",
      "Would workers benefit?",
      "Consumers remain generally dour about the U.S. economy, with recent CBS News polling finding that Americans want Mr. Trump to focus more on lowering prices.",
      "\"Lower-income households have experienced weaker wage growth in 2025, while inflation has steadily eroded their checking and savings balances,\" analysts with PNC Economics Research said in a report this week.",
      "While a stronger economy can translate into higher wages in many industries, workers are taking home a smaller slice of the economic pie. The labor share of the nation's GDP slid to its lowest point since 1947, dropping to 53.8% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Even sharply higher economic growth might not do much to assuage public frustration with the cost of food, rent and other affordability issues, Pancotti said, pointing to the example of the strong post-pandemic growth under President Joe Biden. While GDP grew at a 7% pace for two quarters in 2021, Americans were more focused on pocketbook issues such as higher grocery and housing costs, she added.",
      "\"Joe Biden had [strong GDP growth], and yet his marks on the economy were low, given that people want lower prices,\" she added. \"They want to be able to afford their grocery bills and send their kids to summer camp.\"",

    "story": [
      "A car wash chain with locations across Indiana and Minnesota ranks as the best place to work in the U.S., according to employee reviews on job site Glassdoor.",
      "Indianapolis-based Crew Carwash scored the top spot on Glassdoor's 100 Best Places to Work in 2026. Crew, a family-owned business that last year earned the second spot on the list, employs about 1,000 part- and full-time workers across its 55 locations in the Midwest.",
      "Glassdoor bases its rankings on insiders' takes on criteria that can determine a\u00a0good job, ranging from opportunities for career growth to satisfaction with compensation and benefits. Its proprietary awards algorithm analyzed anonymous reviews of U.S.-based employers posted on the site from October 2024 through October 2025.",
      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",
      "Still, most American workers are disengaged at work, meaning they're either doing the bare minimum or are resentful or unhappy, Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report found. Only 3 in 10 workers are engaged, the lowest level in a decade.",
      "Engaged workers tend to have higher productivity and create better business outcomes, Gallup noted. Workers are checking out amid new pressures in the workplace, from the disruption of artificial intelligence to budget cuts, Gallup said.",
      "Tech companies losing dominance",
      "Although tech companies remain the best-represented industry on the list, taking 24 spots, they appear to be losing their luster among workers. That number is down from 26 spots in 2025 and 31 in 2024.",
      "\"This is part of an ongoing trend where many tech employers are trimming some of the things that made the job so appealing over the last year,\" Zhao said. \"They are pushing harder and harder on efficiency and productivity.\"",
      "To be sure, \"there is still an enormous career and income upside, and you see that reflected in chipmaker Nvidia ranking third,\" he said.",
      "This year's rankings added nineteen companies to the list, including Alaska Airlines at No. 38, Bath and Body Works at No. 80, Dutch Bros Coffee at No. 75 and Bank of America at No. 96.",
      "Only two companies have made the list for each of the 18 years Glassdoor has released the rankings: Bain & Company, which ranked No. 8 in 2026, and Google, which stands at No. 11 this year.",
      "Some white-collar employers are also dropping off the list, as some workers start to view blue-collar work as less likely to be supplanted by AI, Zhao said.",
      "\"There is still a balance with many industries represented,\" Zhao said. \"But it is reflective of the overall trend in the job market where we are seeing hiring freeze up in white-collar industries.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The threat of a partial government shutdown looms large this week after Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
      "For weeks, lawmakers in both parties and across both chambers have been working to pass individual funding measures before government funding lapses on Friday, Jan. 30.",
      "Six of the 12 appropriations bills have already cleared both chambers and been signed into law. And the Senate was expected this week to take up the remaining six funding measures, which passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together to secure swifter passage through the upper chamber.",
      "The remaining six bills include funding for the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; State; and Treasury and other related agencies. And crucially, funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and Border Patrol, is part of the six-bill package.",
      "Now, the grouping of those funding measures is creating complications in the Senate, after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents led a slew of Senate Democrats to oppose any funding package that includes DHS. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that Democrats would not provide the necessary votes to advance the package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs if DHS funding is included. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "Even independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who was among a trio of senators who crossed the aisle to negotiate a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year, said he won't vote for a package that includes the DHS measure.",
      "\"I hate shutdowns,\" King said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"But I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.\"",
      "Still, King, who caucuses with Democrats, argued that \"there's an easy way out\" of the funding fight, saying Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate the DHS bill from the other five funding measures.",
      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",
      "King joined a number of Senate Democrats advocating for the approach. And later Sunday, Schumer signaled Democrats more broadly would be willing to move forward with the other five funding bills.",
      "\"Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,\" Schumer said in a statement, calling it the \"best course of action.\"",
      "In another statement Monday, Schumer put pressure on Senate GOP leaders to move forward with the funding bills without the DHS funds.",
      "\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"",
      "But whether the will exists among Senate Republicans to strip out the DHS funding bill from the broader package, which would require unanimous consent, remains to be seen. Heading into the week, GOP Senate leaders were expected to move forward as planned. Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week.",
      "The DHS bill was considered separately from the other funding bills in the House last week after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to ICE, following the first deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis. The measure ultimately picked up support from seven House Democrats.",
      "House and Senate appropriators released the text of the DHS funding measure, along with three other measures, last week.",
      "At the time, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriators, characterized the DHS measure as a positive step, while acknowledging that it fell short of the reforms that Democrats had sought. And they argued that neither a continuing resolution to keep the government funded nor a government shutdown would rein in ICE due to funding allocated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, making an alternative strategy in the funding fight futile.",
      "Ultimately, DeLauro voted against the bill that she had negotiated, while Murray has pledged to do the same.",
      "\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said in a post on X pledging to oppose the measure. \"The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate \u2014 Republicans must work with us to do that.\"",
      "Some Senate Republicans have spoken out following Saturday's shooting, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing,\" while arguing that the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" and calling for a joint federal and state investigation. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina likewise called for \"thorough and impartial investigation,\" as did Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said a \"comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work.\" Sens. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Jon Husted of Ohio later joined the calls for an investigation into the incident.",
      "Whether more Republicans follow suit, or go further, remains an open question.",
      "Adding to the difficulties for the Senate this week is a winter storm in Washington. Though the Senate had been set to return Monday for votes, senators are now set to return Tuesday afternoon due to the weather, shortening the already tight timeline to avert a partial shutdown by the week's end.",
      "Should senators be unable to approve additional funding, agencies and programs would begin to shut down after Jan. 30. But the shutdown would differ from the one that stretched through October and into November since some appropriations bills have already passed both chambers and been signed into law.",
      "Funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch passed as part of the deal to reopen the government in November and was signed into law. Funding for the departments of Commerce and Justice; Interior and the EPA as well as energy and water development has also passed both chambers and was signed into law last week, meaning they would continue to operate like usual even as other parts of the government shut down.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of the Treasury said Monday that it is canceling all contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton after a former contractor who worked for the consulting firm leaked tax information belonging to thousands of people, including President Trump.",
      "In 2024, former IRS contractor Charles Edward Littlejohn of Washington, D.C. \u2014 who worked for Booz Allen Hamilton \u2014 was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to leaking tax information about Mr. Trump and others to news outlets.",
      "Littlejohn gave data to The New York Times and ProPublica between 2018 and 2020 in leaks that appeared to be \"unparalleled in the IRS's history,\" prosecutors said.",
      "The Treasury Department said in a new release on Monday that the tax return leak affected roughly 406,000 people, citing IRS data. The agency did not note Littlejohn's release of Mr. Trump's tax info.",
      "\"President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.\"",
      "A representative from Booz Allen Hamilton was not immediately available for comment.",
      "In court documents, prosecutors said Littlejohn had applied to work as a contractor specifically to get Mr. Trump's tax returns and figured out how to search and extract tax data to avoid triggering suspicions internally.",
      "\"I made my decision with full knowledge that I would likely end up in a courtroom to answer for my serious crime,\" Littlejohn said at the time of his sentencing in January of 2024. \"I used my skills to systematically violate the privacy of thousands of people.\"",

    "summary": "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility,\" one DHS official said.",
    "story": [
      "Soon after Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent, top Trump administration officials made sweeping, categorical statements about the deadly shooting before a full investigation had begun.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said the Border Patrol agent fired \"defensive shots,\" fearing for his life because Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti intended to \"kill\" and \"inflict maximum damage.\" Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said Pretti planned to \"massacre\" federal agents. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin.\"",
      "These statements by senior administration officials, many of which have been directly contradicted by videos of the incident and witness accounts, have caused internal frustration among some at DHS who are increasingly concerned about the agency's reputation, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told CBS News.",
      "One U.S. government official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said top DHS officials were mishandling the public messaging around the deadly incident, making statements that were not supported by concrete evidence, before any investigative findings came out.",
      "\"It's unclear who at DHS thought it would be a good idea to make such claims before any facts were established, but it was a terrible miscalculation,\" the U.S. official said.",
      "A Homeland Security official who works on immigration enforcement expressed concern about the possibility of \"self-inflicted reputational harm\" being caused by the \"strong language\" used by top officials following Pretti's killing.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" the DHS official said, also requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Nobody, including President Trump, wants to see people get shot or hurt.\"",
      "\"That's exactly why Governor Walz and Mayor Frey need to allow local police to work with federal law enforcement to remove illegal alien criminals, murderers, and pedophiles from Minnesota,\" Leavitt added.",
      "The frustrations inside DHS come amid a shift in public opinion toward President Trump's deportation efforts. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that Americans' support for his deportation campaign had fallen to 46%, down from 59% at the start of his administration. The poll also found 61% of those surveyed believe immigration agents are being \"too tough.\"",
      "A former senior Border Patrol official who continues to be in touch with current agency personnel said many still \"believe in the overall effort.\"",
      "\"But what is being done is starting to lose them,\" the former official said, noting the \"initial narrative\" from DHS about the shooting \"undermines our credibility.\"",
      "\"They feel caught in the middle with harmful rhetoric on both sides,\" the former official said.",
      "\"A horrible situation for everyone\"",
      "The shooting of 37-year-old Pretti has further inflamed tensions in Minneapolis, which has been the focus of the deployment of federal agents so far under President Trump's nationwide campaign against illegal immigration. It came less than three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, another U.S. citizen and Minneapolis resident.",
      "In Good's case, top Trump administration officials also made broad accusations early on, branding her a \"domestic terrorist\" and alleging that she had sought to injure the ICE officer. Lawyers representing Good's family have said the Minneapolis mother and her partner were observing ICE activity.",
      "Videos of the latest shooting show Pretti standing in the middle of a street holding up his phone toward Border Patrol agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was sprayed with a chemical agent before being wrestled to the ground by agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "While DHS alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"violently resisted\" when agents tried to disarm him, videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before he's shot. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "How the incident is being investigated is also raising questions. U.S. officials and FBI Director Kash Patel said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch has taken the lead role investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual. Instead of tasking an outside entity to probe the shooting, they noted, ICE would be tasked with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "As in the Good case, Minnesota state officials have said they've been blocked from accessing evidence needed to investigate Pretti's shooting. Over the weekend, a federal judge barred DHS from altering or destroying evidence of the incident. The judge is holding a hearing on the case later Monday.",
      "A Border Patrol official who was granted anonymity to speak freely said the Trump administration should wait for an investigation before making definitive statements about Pretti's killing, calling the shooting \"a horrible situation for everyone.\"",
      "The official said immigration agents are facing an \"extremely difficult situation\" in the field, citing instances of them getting attacked or obstructed while on the job.",
      "Border Patrol agents, the official argued, have been \"beat up\" by both sides of the political spectrum in recent years. First, by some conservatives, who accused them of being complicit in the crisis at the U.S. southern border under former President Joe Biden and now, by liberals angry over President Trump's deportation crackdown.",
      "\"We are being politicized and that's not the job we signed up for,\" the Border Patrol official said.",

      "Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot and killed by an ICE agent around 9 a.m. local time Saturday in south Minneapolis.",
      "The decision to place HSI in the lead investigative role is unusual and has raised questions among current and former federal law enforcement officials, given that HSI is not typically tasked with investigating officer-involved shootings and is not structured or equipped to handle core elements of such cases, including ballistics analysis, forensic processing, firearm examinations, video review and large-scale witness canvassing.",
      "HSI historically has investigated crimes with an international or immigration nexus, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, child exploitation and the theft of stolen artifacts.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News, \"All the pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS in HSI, and I don't want to comment on their ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Patel added that investigators are focused on \"mostly scientific evidence,\" including fingerprints, DNA, how many rounds were fired and other physical evidence associated with the firearm.",
      "A former senior ICE and HSI official told CBS News that the approach marks a clear break from prior administrations and long-standing practice. The official said it makes little sense for the Department of Homeland Security to oversee a criminal investigation into a fatal shooting involving its own personnel rather than turning the matter over to an outside entity, describing the current setup as highly irregular.",
      "\"That's not the way it was done before this admin,\" one former senior ICE official told CBS News, calling the Trump administration's move \"not normal.\"",
      "The former official noted HSI agents are criminal investigators, but said a probe into a Border Patrol shooting should be handled by an entity outside of the Department of Homeland Security. Both ICE and Border Patrol are overseen by DHS.",
      "Any potential prosecution would still have to be handled by the Justice Department.",
      "Pretti is the second person killed by ICE agents in recent weeks in Minneapolis, after Renee Good\u00a0was fatally shot\u00a0on Jan. 7.

      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti approached several officers with a handgun. They attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots,\" she said.",

      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Saturday that Democrats will not put up the necessary votes to advance a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security in the wake of immigration agents shooting and killing a man in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "\"What's happening in Minnesota is appalling \u2014and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"I will vote no. Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.\"",
      "The House on Thursday passed a funding package, along with a separate measure to fund DHS, sending the bills to the Senate for approval, along with two other funding measures that passed the House last week.",
      "In the Senate, the DHS funding measure was expected to be packaged with the other legislation that funds key federal departments in hopes the Senate passes the measures together before the Jan. 30 deadline to fund the government.",
      "To advance the legislation, Republicans will likely need eight Democrats to vote for the legislation, since Sen. Rand Paul has generally voted against appropriations bills. If the funding package does not pass the Senate, there will be another partial government shutdown.",
      "But on Sunday, Schumer called for the six-bill funding package to be broken up, allowing the Senate to pass the non-DHS portions \"while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.\"",
      "Schumer's comments come after a Border Patrol agent\u00a0shot and killed a 37-year-old man in south Minneapolis Saturday morning. Saturday's shooting comes after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good on Jan. 7 in South Minneapolis as well. Both victims are American citizens, and video of both incidents have spread quickly online.",
      "Family identified the victim in Saturday's shooting as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an intensive care nurse living in Minneapolis. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a news conference that the man who was killed \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers while they were conducting \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operations, with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. Noem said officers attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots.\"",
      "Nevada Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, who were two of the eight Democrats\u00a0who voted against their party to end the 43-day government shutdown last year, both said Saturday that they will not support the measure funding DHS. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, another one of those eight Democrats, already said Friday he would not support funding DHS.",
      "Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and had consistently voted to keep the government open during the last shutdown, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he would not vote to fund DHS.",
      "\"I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances \u2014 what they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis,\" he said.",

      "Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Saturday evening she \"will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.\"",
      "Several other Democratic senators on Saturday did not support funding DHS, including Sens.

      "The fatal shooting\u00a0of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents on Saturday has further escalated tensions in Minneapolis, a city now at the center of America's heated battle over immigration enforcement.",
      "Pretti's killing occurred less than three weeks after Renee Good, another Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "A total of 3,000 ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents are now operating in the city, a force that is roughly five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department, which has about 600 officers. A top ICE official said Sunday that federal agents had carried out roughly 3,400 arrests in the area, though he did not say how many arrestees had criminal records.",
      "Here's a look at how the Trump administration's crackdown in Minneapolis has unfolded, and the major events that have placed the Midwestern city in the national and global spotlight.",
      "Dec. 1: ICE launches crackdown in Minneapolis area",
      "ICE launched \"Operation Metro Surge\" in the Minneapolis area in the first week of December, the latest in a string of Trump administration immigration crackdowns targeting Democratic communities. CBS News reported at the time that ICE planned to target, in part, those with deportation orders, including Somali immigrants, a population President Trump has harshly criticized.",
      "Minnesota had drawn nationwide attention due to a litany of fraud schemes that allegedly bilked billions of dollars from the state's federally funded public assistance programs. Mr. Trump attacked state officials over the fraud scandals \u2014 and zeroed in on the fact that most of the dozens charged in the schemes were of Somali descent.",
      "The state has the nation's largest Somali American population, the vast majority of them U.S. citizens, either by birth or through naturalization, according to census data.",
      "Dec. 26: Viral video alleges fraud in Minnesota day cares",
      "In a now-viral YouTube video posted the day after Christmas, conservative influencer Nick Shirley visited nearly a dozen day care facilities in the Minneapolis area that he alleged were receiving taxpayer money but not providing any services. The video, which has racked up nearly 4 million views on YouTube, was amplified by Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "State investigators later visited several of the day care centers highlighted in his video, and said nine of them were \"operating as expected.\" Eight of the facilities had children present during the inspection, and a ninth was not yet open for the day, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said. One of the centers closed in early January.",
      "Dec. 29: ICE dispatches agents to visit Minneapolis-area businesses",
      "Days after the Shirley video was posted, agents from ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch were dispatched to conduct site visits to several dozen Minneapolis businesses. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they were overseeing a \"massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.\"",
      "Jan. 5: Thousands of additional federal agents are deployed",
      "Roughly a week after the Shirley video, CBS News first reported that the Trump administration would be deploying an additional 2,000 federal immigration agents to the Twin Cities. The Department of Homeland Security subsequently called the deployment the largest operation in its history.",
      "The reinforcements included Border Patrol agents, including commander Gregory Bovino, who had previously led sweeping and controversial immigration enforcement operations in Charlotte, Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "Jan. 7: Renee Good shot and killed by ICE officer",
      "Two days later, an ICE officer in Minneapolis fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good while she was behind the wheel of her car, sparking outrage and setting off days of protests.",
      "Videos of the incident appear to show Good's car was approached by multiple ICE officers, one of whom stepped in front of her vehicle. Good backed up, turned her wheel and began to drive her car forward, and the officer in front of the SUV, identified as Jonathan Ross, fired multiple shots.",
      "Mr. Trump and members of his administration accused Good of intentionally hitting and trying to run over the agent, in what Noem described as an \"act of domestic terrorism\" that left the officer injured. Lawyers representing Good's family have said Good and her partner were observing ICE operations.\u00a0Analysis of video from the scene suggested Good may have been trying to steer away from the officers, not towards them.",
      "Hours later, Mayor Jacob Frey sharply criticized ICE, telling the agency: \"Get the f*** out of Minneapolis.\"",
      "Jan. 13: Prosecutors resign as they face pressure over Renee Good investigation",
      "At least six career prosecutors in the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office resigned, including Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, as the office faced pressure to treat the investigation of Renee Good's shooting as a case of assault on a federal officer as opposed to a civil rights case. At least six Justice Department prosecutors, most of them supervisors in the Civil Rights Division, said they were leaving the department soon after they learned there would not be a civil rights investigation into Good's shooting.",
      "An FBI supervisor in the Minneapolis field office's public corruption squad later resigned, too, partly over pressure to \"discontinue\" the investigation of Good's shooting, a source told CBS News.",
      "Separately, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension withdrew from a probe into the shooting, saying the Justice Department had blocked state investigators\u00a0from accessing evidence.",
      "Jan. 15: ICE officer shoots man in leg during alleged shovel attack",
      "Exactly a week after the killing of Good, DHS said another ICE officer shot a Venezuelan migrant he was trying to arrest in Minneapolis. The department said the migrant and two other Venezuelan men attacked the ICE officer with a snow shovel and broom handle. The officer, DHS said, shot the original target of the operation in the leg following a confrontation.",
      "The Venezuelan man suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was later charged by the Justice Department and accused of assaulting the ICE officer, alongside another migrant involved in the altercation.",
      "Jan. 15: Trump threatens to use Insurrection Act in Minneapolis",
      "As protests over the immigration operations continued to flare, President Trump threatened\u00a0to invoke the Insurrection Act if state officials didn't \"stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.\"",
      "If the president decides to invoke the law, it could set the stage for the military to be deployed onto the streets of Minneapolis over the objections of state and local officials.",
      "Later that week, some 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska were placed on standby for a possible deployment to Minnesota, a defense official told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, the Justice Department has weighed working with the Pentagon on a smaller scale in Minnesota, calling for military lawyers and forensic accountants to assist with fraud investigations in the state.",
      "Jan. 16: Judge blocks agents from arresting or using pepper spray on peaceful protesters",
      "A federal judge blocked DHS agents from arresting or using pepper spray and nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters in Minnesota, after a lawsuit alleged federal agents \"violently subdued\" demonstrations against immigration enforcement.",
      "The government has denied using excessively heavy-handed tactics, with Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin saying the agency \"is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters.\"",
      "An appellate court paused the order less than a week later.",
      "Jan. 16: Justice Department probes Frey, Walz and other Minnesota officials over alleged obstruction of immigration agents",
      "On Jan. 16, CBS News disclosed a Justice Department investigation into allegations that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and other local officials had conspired to impede federal immigration agents.",
      "Walz and Frey denounced the probe, calling it political intimidation.",
      "A week later, the Justice Department subpoenaed the offices of Walz, Frey and other top state and local officials, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.",
      "Jan. 18: Anti-ICE protesters disrupt church service, triggering Justice Department crackdown",
      "A group of protesters angry over ICE's presence in Minnesota entered a church in St. Paul on Jan. 18, disrupting a Sunday service. The protesters said they focused on Cities Church because a man listed as pastor at the church also appeared to work for ICE.",
      "The protest, which prompted families with children and other congregants to leave the church, was widely condemned by conservatives and the Trump administration, which quickly vowed to launch a criminal investigation. The Justice Department also said it would bring charges against former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was present in the church at the time. Lemon said he was reporting on the protest.",
      "Three people were arrested on federal charges several days after the protest, but a federal magistrate judge refused to sign arrest warrants for five other people, including Lemon,\u00a0sources told CBS News. Federal prosecutors asked an appeals court to order the lower court to issue the remaining arrest warrants, but a panel of appellate judges declined that request.",
      "Jan. 18: U.S. citizen detained by ICE at gunpoint",
      "Immigration agents forced their way into a house in St. Paul, Minnesota, and detained ChongLy \"Scott\" Thao \u2014 a Hmong American and U.S. citizen \u2014 at gunpoint without a warrant, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Images of 56-year-old Thao being led out of his home in handcuffs, wearing only underwear, Crocs and a blanket draped over his shoulders in the snow, provoked anger toward ICE and renewed questions about the agency's tactics. Thao was later released.",
      "DHS described the incident at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders who it said lived at the same address, and alleged Thao matched the description of the suspect. Thao's family has strongly disputed the claim that the suspects lived there.",
      "A day later, two whistleblowers revealed ICE had quietly issued a memo in May 2025 authorizing its officers to forcibly enter people's homes, without a judicial warrant, during operations targeting those with deportation orders. The directive marked a seismic shift from longstanding rules meant to comply with the Fourth Amendment, which has long been interpreted to mean law enforcement can't enter private property without a judge's warrant.",
      "Jan. 20: ICE takes 5-year-old boy into custody with his father",
      "On Jan. 20, a team of ICE officers in Minneapolis took into custody a man from Ecuador and his 5-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos. Videos and photos of the incident \u2014 depicting Liam wearing a blue bunny hat and his school backpack \u2014 garnered national attention, triggering questions about who the Trump administration was targeting in its mass deportation effort.",
      "Dueling narratives of the incident quickly materialized. Federal officials said ICE targeted the man's father \u2014 not Liam \u2014 and accused him of being in the U.S. illegally. According to their version of events, Liam's father tried to flee ICE and abandoned Liam in a car in the process. After arresting the father, the agency said ICE officers attempted to get Liam's mother to take him but she refused to do so.",
      "People who have spoken to the mother said she was scared to open the door to ICE, fearing she too would get arrested. Advocates and school officials accused ICE of trying to use Liam as bait \u2014 a claim ICE has denied.",
      "Liam and his father are currently being held at a family detention center overseen by ICE in Texas. CBS News reported\u00a0they have pending immigration cases and can't be legally deported for now.",
      "Jan. 24: Alex Pretti fatally shot by Border Patrol agents",
      "Just weeks after Renee Good's shooting, a second person was shot and killed by immigration agents: Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen who worked as an ICU nurse.",
      "Videos of the incident show Pretti standing in the middle of a Minneapolis street holding up his phone toward immigration agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was wrestled to the ground by a group of agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "Noem alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"reacted violently\" when officers tried to disarm him, forcing the agent to fire \"defensive shots.\" Videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before the shooting, and one video from immediately beforehand, when officers were struggling with Pretti, appears to show an agent reaching into the scrum empty-handed and emerging with a gun. Local police officials have said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the officer, with Bovino accusing Pretti, without citing evidence, of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" during an operation to pursue a man who was in the country illegally and wanted for domestic assault. Local politicians have condemned the shooting, with Walz calling it \"sickening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" adding that even if an investigation ultimately finds the shooting was lawful, it may not matter \"because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "Jan. 24: Bondi makes three demands to \"bring back law and order\"",
      "In a three-page letter, Bondi pressed Walz to let the federal government review Minnesota's voter rolls and welfare data, and to give ICE greater access to jails in the state.",
      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon rejected the request, calling it \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law.\"",
      "The Trump administration has long pushed authorities in Minnesota to cooperate more extensively with ICE's requests to detain people and to let federal agents go into detention facilities. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "In a Truth Social post a day later, Mr. Trump also called on local law enforcement to assist ICE, urging Walz, Frey and Democratic officials nationwide to \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.\"",
      "Jan. 25:\u00a0 Minneapolis police chief says, \"This is not sustainable\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said \"people have had enough\" and urged leaders to \"come together and figure this out.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks,\" he said in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable\" for the city's 600 officers, O'Hara said. \"This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",

If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation. We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget.

We believe in peace, and we believe that Donald Trump needs to pull these 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another person, and we're up here telling another story of a Minnesotan just trying to live their life without the interference,\" Walz said. \"To Americans who are watching this right now, and I don't know, maybe you're watching it with curiosity, bewilderment, horror, scorn or sympathy. I've got a question for all of you. What side do you wanna be on?\"",

      "Opening remarks",
      "I had the privilege of talking with Michael and Susan, Alex's parents, yesterday and the heartache in the hours after your son's murdered in front of the world is one thing, but what stood out to me was a parent's desire and their passion to make sure that the story of Alex was told.",
      "Someone who went to work to care for veterans, someone who was a valued co-worker, someone who relished and lived in this state in a big way whether it was outdoor activities or being down there on the street as a First Amendment witness to what ICE is doing to this, to this state.",
      "So, once again to Michael and Susan, when I talk to these parents, it's always in deep confidential conversation. In this one, though, Michael was very clear to me. He said, \"Don't let them forget Alex's story.\"",
      "The world knows how he died. He died at the hands of ICE agents on the streets of Minneapolis. They want us to make sure we said how he lived. So to Michael and Susan, our deepest sympathies, but you have my commitment to continue to tell that story.",
      "So now we've got two Minnesotans dead, we didn't have time to start telling [Renee Good's] story of a poet and a mother and a bright spirit, and now we're telling Alex's story.",
      "So my question is, what's the plan, Donald Trump? What is the plan? What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state? If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation.",
      "We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget. We're angry, but we won't give up hope. And above all else, we are clearly unified. If it was the intention of Donald Trump to make an example of Minnesota, then I'm damn proud of the example that the world's seeing.",
      "We believe in law and order in this state. We believe in peace, and we believe that Donald Trump needs to pull these 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another person, and we're up here telling another story of a Minnesotan just trying to live their life without the interference.",
      "To Americans who are watching this right now, and I don't know, maybe you're watching it with curiosity, bewilderment, horror, scorn or sympathy. I've got a question for all of you: What side do you wanna be on?",
      "The side of an all-powerful federal government that can kill, injure, menace and kidnap its citizens off the streets? On the side of a nurse at the VA hospital who died bearing witness to such a government? Or the side of a mother whose last words were, \"I'm not mad at you\"?",
      "The sight of tens of thousands of peaceful citizens who showed up to march when the wind chill was 40 below because they love this state and they love this country.",
      "You're allowed to decide at any point that you're not with us anymore. If you voted for this administration, heck, even if you thought Operation Metro Surge was a good idea, sounded like the thing to do a month ago, you're still allowed to look at what's happening here in Minnesota and say, \"This isn't what I voted for, and this isn't what I want.\"",
      "I ask you not to stand by idly. Speak out, share what you're seeing to others and urge others to put politics aside. We're no longer having a political debate. We're having a moral debate.",
      "We all want secure borders and immigration enforcement that prioritizes criminals, and I want to thank the press, especially the local press, who has done a deep dive to show that's exactly what Minnesota does.",
      "But what you're seeing is not common sense, lawful or humane enforcement. That's not what this occupation is about.",
      "Let me say our conversation should not be about, and I know we get asked of what we're doing out there, how many state patrol or police or national guard I can put on the street. This isn't about how many people I can put on the street; it's about how many of these people, these ICE agents and whoever else was thrown into this unholy mess, how many Donald Trump can get out of here?",
      "Minnesotans, you've won the hearts and minds of people across this country, and you've done it through your peaceful, resolved defense of your neighbors and the Constitution.",

      "Closing remarks",
      "I'm going to close with one thing that I promised the parents, with Michael and Susan, and I speak to all Americans on this over these last 24 hours, what you saw, you're now knowing more about this young man, beloved by his family, accomplished ICU nurse, skillful ability to work with veterans, someone who is beloved by community, no criminal record, lawful firearms owner.",
      "And you know what you saw, and then you heard the most powerful people in the world, certainly in this country \u2014 the president, vice president, Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem \u2014 narrate to you what you were looking at that this was a domestic terrorist, crazed, running at law enforcement with the intent to kill massive numbers of them, sullying his name within minutes of this event happening. And then closing the crime scene, sweeping away the evidence, defying a court order and not allowing anyone to look at it.",
      "I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America. If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.",
      "This has to be the moment.",
      "Your government here in Minnesota, I've made it clear I'm accountable for things that happen here, and I will take responsibility for that. Someone has to be accountable. Someone has to hold the final decision on this. And sitting behind a keyboard at 2 a.m. and besmirching a VA nurse and a son and a co-worker and a friend is despicable beyond all description.",
      "This is not \"we need to see both sides.\" This is not \"we need to wait for this.\" This is basic human decency. And at this point in time, I'm just asking try, for a moment, to set aside the political side of it and go back and ground in the humanity of this. This family has gone through enough, and to have the most powerful man in the world drag their dead son with absolutely no evidence and gaslight the entire country? This is enough.",
      "And I would say, President Trump, you can end this today. Pull these folks back. Do humane, focused, effective immigration control. You've got the support of all of us to do that, let our law enforcement continue to do what they do, making Minnesota one of the safest states in the country, one of the best places to live. Allow our children to go back to school. We have got children in Minnesota hiding in their houses, afraid to go outside.",
      "Many of us grew up reading that story of Anne Frank. Somebody is going to write that children's story about Minnesota. And there's one person who can end this now.",
      "And I'll go back to it again. Please show some decency, pull these folks out, reset this situation and allow us to do the job that the attorney general and myself were elected to do: protect the people of Minnesota and carry out the laws of Minnesota.",

Angus King of Maine said Sunday that he won't vote for a package to fund the government if it includes funding for ICE, as lawmakers scramble to pass a slate of funding bills to stave off a partial government shutdown by Friday \u2014  but he argued that \"we don't have to have a shutdown.\"",
      "\"I hate shutdowns,\" King said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"But I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances \u2014 what they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis,\" the senator continued, referring to an immigration enforcement operation launched in Maine last week.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday, after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old Minneapolis man by federal agents, that Democrats will not put up the necessary votes to advance a funding package to prevent a partial government shutdown if it includes funds for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.",
      "So far, six of the 12 appropriations bills have been passed by Congress and signed into law. The Senate has until Friday, Jan. 30 to approve the final six bills, which have been packaged together, after they passed the House in recent weeks. That package includes a bill that would fund DHS until the end of the fiscal year. If those final six bills aren't passed by the Senate and signed by President Trump by Friday, the agencies that they cover will begin to shut down.",
      "Schumer in a statement Sunday said, \"Senate Democrats will not allow the current DHS funding bill to move forward.\"",
      "\"Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,\" Schumer said. \"The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public. People should be safe from abuse by their own government.\"",
      "Schumer urged Republicans to \"work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill.\"",
      "King, who caucuses with Democrats, was among a trio of senators who negotiated a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year. He argued that \"there's an easy way out\" of the funding fight, saying Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate the DHS bill from the other five funding measures.",
      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: As a paralyzing winter storm barrels through a vast part of the country, the standoff between federal law enforcement agencies and the Minneapolis community explodes following yet another deadly shooting of a protester.",
      "It's happened again. Minneapolis is the scene of the violent death of a protester at the hands of federal immigration agents. In this case, 37- year-old Alex Pretti was shot and killed Saturday morning outside a donut shop amid what federal officials say was an unrelated immigration operation led by Customs and Border Protection agents.",
      "Interpretations of the extensive videos of the shooting are mixed. And much like the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis just over two weeks ago, federal and state officials are at odds over what happened and why and who should investigate.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-Minnesota): They killed a man, created chaos, pushed down protesters, threw gas indiscriminately, and then left the scene, and then we're left to clean up.",
      "GREGORY BOVINO (Border Patrol Commander): This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will have a report from the scene and talk exclusively to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara, then turn to the bigger picture, as Senate Democrats threaten to block funding for ICE and DHS agencies, while the public increasingly is wary of ICE actions and the subsequent pushback.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Maine independent Senator Angus King, whose home state is the site of ICE's new deportation operation called Catch of the Day. We will also talk with the outgoing Canadian Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman about the growing divide between the U.S. and our neighbors to the north.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we come on the air, over 200 million Americans in 35 states from New Mexico to Maine are dealing with or preparing for the massive winter storm that is now moving across the country. There are already at least 700,000 people without power. Thousands of flights have either been canceled or are delayed.",
      "And there is a cold front moving in behind that storm, which will likely make the situation facing most Americans as this workweek begins even more treacherous.",
      "We turn now to the volatile situation in Minneapolis and the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was a U.S. citizen.",
      "CBS News correspondent Lana Zak reports.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "LANA ZAK (voice-over): Multiple cell phone videos captured the moments before 37-year-old Alex Pretti was killed. In the footage, Pretti is seen wearing a baseball cap and holding a cell phone. Moments later, after a federal agent shoved and sprayed another person, several officers tackle Pretti.",
      "One appears to retrieve a gun and turn away. Then at least one other agent fires multiple shots, killing him.",
      "Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino defended the shooting, saying that CBP agents were conducting an operation involving a different man in the country illegally.",
      "GREGORY BOVINO (Border Patrol Commander): An individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a Border Patrol agent fired defensive shots.",
      "LANA ZAK: Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara says he sent local officers to the scene.",
      "BRIAN O'HARA (Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Chief): We believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "LANA ZAK: DHS officials released a photo of what they say is Pretti's gun.",
      "Did the 37-year-old who had a license to carry, did he brandish a gun? And at what point did law enforcement retrieve the gun and also the magazines from him? Can you offer clarity on where those were found?",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): This individual showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. They responded according to their training and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him.",
      "And I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition, rather than a sign. This is a violent riot when you have someone showing up with weapons and are using them to assault law enforcement officers.",
      "LANA ZAK: Several eyewitnesses dispute those claims. In a court affidavit, one resident testified \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I have read the statement from DHS about what happened and it is wrong. The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera. He was just trying to help a woman get up. And they took him to the ground.\"",
      "Another witness who self-identified as a pediatrician and after asking several times was permitted to perform CPR testified that \u2013 quote \u2013 \"I saw that the victim was lying on his side and was surrounded by several ICE agents. Checking for a pulse and administering CPR is standard practice. Instead of doing either of those things, the ICE agents appeared to be counting his bullet wounds.\"",
      "Alex Pretti was an ICU nurse with the Veterans Affairs' health system.",
      "In a statement, Pretti's parents say: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.\"",
      "Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the video sickening.",
      "GOVERNOR TIM WALZ (D-Minnesota): This federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. It's a campaign of organized brutality.",
      "LANA ZAK: Pretti is the second U.S. citizen killed in Minneapolis this month in Operation Metro Surge. And the city of Minneapolis erupted in protests.",
      "We hear bottles being thrown. Some people have been taken away. We see somebody right over there now being apprehended.",
      "Throughout the day, protesters gathered even after it was declared an unlawful assembly\u2026",
      "(SHOUTING)",
      "LANA ZAK: \u2026 demonstrating their anger and grief.",
      "(End VT)",
      "LANA ZAK: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension say they have been locked out of this investigation.",
      "And, overnight, a Trump-appointed judge issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the Department of Homeland Security to preserve all evidence. That hearing is scheduled for Monday \u2013 Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Lana Zak reporting from Minneapolis.",
      "We are joined now by the city's police chief, Brian O'Hara.",
      "Chief, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "BRIAN O'HARA (Minneapolis, Minnesota, Police Chief): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened.",
      "Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened.",
      "Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a \u2013 in a law enforcement-involved shooting just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims.",
      "Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are \u2013 are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that, while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That is the state agency that investigates use-of-force incidents.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are separate from your police force.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves.",
      "I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity, and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.",
      "So I think, very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that, at the time of the shooting, it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just \u2013 there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already \u2013 the impression is left?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: People have had enough.",
      "This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone.",
      "And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: We understand that, for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him.",
      "You said that Pretti \u2013 you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any \u2013 any evidence that I have seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because we checked. The Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes. Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun.",
      "\"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"",
      "The FBI director said: \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\"",
      "Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm. And there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions.",
      "He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, that \u2013 what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police-involved shootings, from the scene.",
      "So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines. But \u2013 but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance. If someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry, the only question would be if they were using the weapon in a \u2013 for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities.",
      "The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job.",
      "About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there.",
      "We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3,000, as we understand it.",
      "The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that, if those policies weren't in place \u2013 these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations \u2013 that none of this would really be happening.",
      "How do you respond to that claim that, because of these sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades.",
      "And it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail. That's at the county level. And the prisons are at the state level.",
      "So we are complying with the law, as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the Guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes, I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard.",
      "As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin-stretched as it is, and we have a job to do trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. attorney's office who had resigned.",
      "We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good.",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is local law enforcement experiencing, beyond your officers, but in the U.S. attorney's office, in your local FBI?",
      "CHIEF BRIAN O'HARA: I mean, the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city.",
      "We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so \u2013 it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away, because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-Louisiana): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself.",
      "You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours. And your fellow Louisianian Senator Bill Cassidy said: \"The events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job.",
      "They're \u2013 look, we are all \u2013 just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago.",
      "They have chaos, it seems like, all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And so I wish yesterday didn't happen.",
      "What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though.",
      "When we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans, I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis \u2013 and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting \u2013 four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin.",
      "And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leaders' fault. But, at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so they have made a decision not to assist ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was talking about the federal response. He was talking to dealing with the federal issues, because, when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76 percent, homicides down 67 percent, burglary down 39 percent year to date, sex offenses down, robberies down.",
      "Motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response \u2013 the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, but, remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down.",
      "And we're seeing that across the country. ICE \u2013 look, again, any time something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret.",
      "The law says you can't be here illegally. And, if you're committing violent crimes \u2013 the president made it clear \u2013 in fact, he was elected, President Trump was elected\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: \u2026 to get rid of criminals in our communities; 416,000\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: \u2026 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because, undoubtedly, the president was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it.",
      "But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe. Almost two-thirds of Americans say they dislike the president's approach to his deportation program.",
      "There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community, yes or no, what do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out.",
      "And, in fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see, by the way, people going in the streets, breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment.",
      "When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign,\" do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a conceal-carry permit. It's worked very well there.",
      "I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know, in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime. And interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities.",
      "You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting that they were unlawful.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: He actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents, throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes. He wasn't talking about the victim, though.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: So, let's tone this down.",
      "And leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz, said they're Gestapo.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to \u2013 yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions.",

      "Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things. Among them, giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs.",
      "What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistleblowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota. And these are stealing programs from learning center, from disabled students programs that are being stolen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And the governor did nothing about it. And obviously we're investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But voter registration logs? As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand over voter registration logs? Like, what's the purpose of that? To end ICE enforcement?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know \u2013 I know we're trying, in Congress, to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standards, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show picture I.D. Those are things we're pushing for. That's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, non-citizens cannot vote.",
      "But I want to ask you, ICE \u2013 about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said its officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, let's \u2013 let's keep in mind that the five-year-old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually protected the child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which the family and \u2013 the family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum. That's \u2013 they don't like the app he used to file for asylum. And they dispute that he fled.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Well, Joe Biden \u2013 Joe Biden allowed millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret. People from prisons in other countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're retroactively trying to change the legality of his status.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: President Trump was elected \u2013 the number one issue last year was President Trump saying I'm going to secure the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. And 416,000 criminals have \u2013 illegals have been arrested by ICE.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: By \u2013 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Forty-seven percent of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions, 47 percent.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: By the way, ICE just put up a website \u2013 not ICE, Homeland Security, Worst of the Worst DHS. Go Google Worst of the Worst DHS. State by state they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state. You can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam, or the two-year-old who was separated from her mother.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: That father was here illegally and abandoned his child.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up, 416,000 people with violent, criminal records.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: These are people \u2013 and, by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: In part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. And 416,000 of them removed.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: This is a hard job ICE has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They do indeed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: And local law enforcement \u2013 local officials, the mayor, the governor, should not be encouraging people to go out on the streets and break the law by interfering with law enforcement. It's a felony to interfere with law enforcement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American citizens are concerned about American citizens being shot. And that's why we are asking the questions about taxpayer funded federal \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Yes. And we don't have that chaos in other cities. Minneapolis has its own problems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Failed leadership that has led to a lot of this. And it's unfortunate it happened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: I wish it didn't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're \u2013 we're talk \u2013 we're talking \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE STEVE SCALISE: Their failed leaders need to look in the mirror and tone it down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to go next \u2013 to our next guest. Leader Scalise, thank you for your time today.",
      "We go to Independent Senator Angus King, who joins us from Maine.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING (I-ME): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state ICE just launched this operation, Catch of the Day, which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants among others, targeting 1,400 criminal aliens who have, quote/unquote, terrorized communities in Maine.",
      "What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us.",
      "And by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established, they list 13 people in Maine. They concede that \u2013 or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are. I'm sorry, 87. My math is off.",
      "But the point is, this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the \u2013 and the \u2013 at the county jail. So, this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the president. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me I have to submit my questions in writing and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be \u2013 I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers.",
      "But this \u2013 here's the real problem, Margaret. The people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking \u2013 we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their \u2013 to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this. And it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these \u2013 by these heavy-handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of get to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully. One of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it \u2013 a job at the border.",
      "But they also point to sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like your \u2013 like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Well, you put your finger on it, Margaret, in the last interview. The question is not, should we enforce the law, should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals. The question is, how is it done.",
      "I did a little research this morning. Obama, during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals. But you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I have never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy-handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and we're having these incidents all over the country. So, it's not necessarily \u2013 you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last \u2013 the end of the last shutdown. But I can't vote for a bill that clues ICE funding under these circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. I \u2013 there's an easy way out, by the way. Leader Thune could separate \u2013 which is what they did in the House, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS.",
      "And, by the way, if those bills pass, 96 percent of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability. And that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's your path to avoid a shutdown.",
      "But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric. In Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement. They're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: I guess I technically would, but I \u2013 I don't \u2013 again \u2013 well, let me \u2013 let me put it in the words of the sheriff in Cumberland County, Maine, when they took one of his recruits. He called it \"bush league policing.\" And I think that sort of summarizes it. And there's no need for this overwhelming show of force.",
      "I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: Again, armed people with masks and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: And intimidating protesters. That's not America.",
      "And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the \u2013 going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: These people are acting outside the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK",
      "SENATOR ANGUS KING: They're ignoring our laws. And we just can't keep supporting that.",

      "We spoke with the outgoing Canadian ambassador to the United States, Kirsten Hillman, on Friday.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN (Canadian Ambassador to the United States): I \u2013 we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time that, you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is \u2013 are important, that looking out in \u2013 for each other in important ways is a number one priority. I think in some quarters Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through. I have no doubt about that. But it \u2013 yes, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have had a long career here in the United States deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump was asked about it January 13th. He said, \"I really don't care,\" in terms of renewing it. \"There's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here.\"",
      "Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, did broad consultations, national consultations with their business communities in particular on what \u2013 how that agreement works for them and really without exception the American comments back were, sure, we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit. But job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world.",
      "So, I think there \u2013 I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people and the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up. And they are saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago your prime minister was in Beijing and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented. And it's very difficult. So, that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values and stand up to China. That seems dead if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, I think \u2013 I think we have to put this in perspective. The agreement that we did with China a few ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely or almost exclusively designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So, over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products, and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from their \u2013 one of their primary markets, if not for some of them their primary market.",
      "And so we went to Beijing to reestablish market access for our farmers and our fisheries. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they reestablished market access for U.S. soy farmers and in exchange roll back some tariffs and fees. So, this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He got a standing ovation for this speech.",

      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Well, that's a good question. I mean I think he laid out in his discussion, his speech his view of what is happening in our world. And it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stably and maximize economic reality. So, we're moving away \u2013 or economic benefits. And we're moving away from that and we have to \u2013 countries like ours have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles, we can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by, by everyone, if they commit to them.",
      "But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic. And we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies.

      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't. But what I can say about the Golden Dome is this. Canada is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defense systems. And a big part of that is arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over the horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive.",
      "So, that is part \u2013 and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug into the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems where we're interoperable, we work together. We make our investments that make sense or Canada in defending our territory and defending our sovereignty. But we work with the Americans and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense but you're on board to help do that?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO because you're also a partner at NATO.",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The only time that NATO's Article V was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan.",
      "Here's what President Trump said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that, and they did. They stayed a little back. A little off the front lines.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check, and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014, 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action.",
      "What does a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "KIRSTEN HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done. And I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true. And that's what matters.",

    "summary": "Minnesota's secretary of state rejected a request from Attorney General Pam Bondi for federal access state voter rolls and welfare data, as tensions flare in Minneapolis after a man was shot and killed by immigration agents.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi is pushing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to let the federal government access the state's voter rolls and public assistance data, as tensions flare in Minneapolis after a second person was shot Saturday by federal immigration agents assigned to a weekslong crackdown in the city.",
      "In a three-page letter obtained by CBS News, Bondi also urged the state of Minnesota to scrap all \"sanctuary\" policies and \"cooperate fully\" with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including giving the agency access to all local jails and honoring federal agents' requests to detain people.",
      "\"I am confident that these simple steps will help bring back law and order to Minnesota and improve the lives of Americans,\" Bondi wrote in her letter to the governor Saturday, which accused state officials of \"anti-law enforcement rhetoric\" and \"putting federal agents in danger.\"",
      "Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon responded with a statement Sunday saying: \"The answer to Attorney General Bondi's request is no.\"",
      "Simon called Bondi's letter \"an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,\" and said it followed \"repeated and failed attempts by the DOJ to pressure my office into providing the same data.\"",
      "The Trump administration has pressed for greater access to Minnesota jails and prisons for weeks, suggesting it may roll back immigration operations in the state if it had more power to go into detention facilities to pursue people accused of being in the U.S. illegally. State corrections officials say they already cooperate with ICE, but cooperation varies at the county level.",
      "Bondi said the federal government needs access to state voter roll data to \"confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.\" The Justice Department has pushed Minnesota and other states to provide voter registration data for months, suing Minnesota for access to the data last year \u2014 but the department typically hasn't tied that push to immigration enforcement efforts in Minnesota in the past.",
      "And Bondi demanded that the state share records on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, so the federal government can \"efficiently investigate fraud,\" as the Trump administration focuses on alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota public assistance programs.",
      "In his response, Simon noted: \"Attorney General Bondi knows full well that the Governor has no formal role in managing our elections or maintaining our voter registration system. She is also well aware that this specific request is the subject of active litigation with our office.\"",
      "\"It is deeply disturbing that the U.S. Attorney General would make this unlawful request a part of an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security,\" Simon added. \"More broadly, the federal government must end the unprecedented and deadly occupation of our state immediately.\"",
      "The governor's office reacted to the letter by urging the Trump administration to \"engage in a serious conversation about ending this federal occupation.\" In a statement Sunday, Walz's office sharply criticized the conduct of federal immigration agents, including Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and another shooting by a federal officer that killed Renee Good earlier this month.",
      "\"This is not common sense, lawful immigration enforcement. That is not what this occupation is about. And it's not what the attorney general's letter is about,\" the statement read.",

    "summary": "The police chief said federal immigration enforcement \"tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said on Sunday that \"people have had enough\" after this weekend's fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by federal agents.",
      "Federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, on Saturday morning. The shooting came as protests have continued in Minnesota's largest city over a federal immigration enforcement surge. Earlier this month, Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, and a Venezuelan migrant was shot in the leg by ICE while allegedly trying to flee.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said agents were acting in self-defense while trying to disarm Pretti, while local officials have pushed back on the account.",
      "O'Hara said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that it's \"deeply concerning the things that are being said.\"",
      "\"This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city,\" O'Hara said. \"So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised.\"",
      "O'Hara added that \"the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.\"",
      "\"This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that's been killed, it's the third shooting within three weeks,\" O'Hara said.",
      "O'Hara added, \"People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again, and I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out.\"",
      "\"This is not sustainable,\" he said. \"This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.\"",
      "Asked whether he is calling on ICE to leave Minneapolis, O'Hara said the problem isn't that \"enforcement is happening, it's clearly the manner in which these things are happening.\"",
      "\"These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community,\" O'Hara said.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said at a news conference Saturday that Pretti was in possession of a gun and ammunition and alleged he assaulted officers. Asked whether he knows if the weapon was concealed or was brandished, O'Hara said, \"I don't have any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have also accused local law enforcement of not doing enough to help ICE officers. O'Hara called those claims \"deeply disappointing.\" He argued that local police are \"doing everything that we can to manage this chaos,\" but are vastly outnumbered by the thousands of immigration agents deployed to the city.",
      "Amid the conflicting narratives and tension between local and federal officials, O'Hara said the police department doesn't have \"any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened,\" adding that when officers responded to the scene of Saturday's shooting, \"our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a law enforcement-involved shooting.\"",
      "\"I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us,\" O'Hara said.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and pointed to \"some failed local leadership,\" saying, \"you don't have these kinds of incidents in any other city\" with federal immigration enforcement operations.",
      "\"Look, we are all just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis, and this has happened over and over again,\" Scalise said. \"They let their city burn down years ago, they have chaos it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans. Good morning to you.",
      "HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STEVE SCALISE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself. You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours, and your fellow Louisianan Senator Bill Cassidy said the events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job. They're- look we are all, just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago. They have chaos, it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You don't- don't see these numbers either?-- .",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- and so, I wish yesterday didn't happen. What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though, when we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans. I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis, and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin. And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leader's fault. But at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so he- was made a decision not to assist ICE-- .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He was talking- he was talking to- dealing with the federal issues. Because when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76%, homicides down 67%, burglary down 39% year-to-date, sex offenses down, robberies down, motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response- the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, but remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down, and we're seeing that across the country. ICE- look again, anytime something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret. The law says you can't be here illegally and if you're committing violent crimes. The President made it clear, in fact, he was elected. President Trump was elected to get rid of criminals in our communities. 416,000 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because undoubtedly, the President was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it. But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe, almost two thirds of Americans say they dislike the President's approach to his deportation program. There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community? Yes or no? What do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out. In fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment. When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign.\" Do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a concealed carry permit. It's worked very well there. I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime and interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities. You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting, that they were unlawful. Yes, he actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents. Throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah, he wasn't talking about the victim --",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- So, let's tone this down. And-and leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric. I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz said they're Gestapo. He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota, offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things, among them giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs. What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor, but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistle blowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota, and these are stealing programs from learning centers, from disabled students, programs that are being stolen, and the Governor did nothing about it. Congress is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But voter registration logs?--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- Investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand- hand over voter registration logs like, what's the purpose of that to end ICE enforcement?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know- I know we're trying in Congress to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standard, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show a picture ID. Those are things we're pushing for that's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-citizens cannot vote. But I want to ask you ICE- about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said his officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Let's keep in mind that the five year old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --the family--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --protected the child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum, that's- they don't like the app he used to file for asylum.",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, Joe- Joe Biden allowed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And they dispute that he fled--.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But they are retroactively trying to change the legality of the status--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --people from prisons in other countries. President Trump was elected. The number one issue last year was President Trump saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Absolutely--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- I'm going to secure the border, and he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. 416,000--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --criminals- illegals have been arrested by ICE. 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people, by the way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 47% of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions. 47%.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --ICE just put up a website. Not ICE, Homeland Security, worst of the worst DHS. Go Google worst of the worst DHS. State by state, they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state, you can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --or the two year old who was separated from her mother.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --that father was here illegally and abandoned his child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "LEADER SCALISE:\u00a0 --Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: 416,000 people with violent criminal records. These are people- and by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 in part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. 416,000 have been removed. Do you want them still out on our streets?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: I don't think most people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No and I don't think--",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "This interview was recorded on Friday, Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So a lot is going on in the relationship between our two countries. We are so deeply integrated here on trade, you buy more from the U.S. than any other country. We have the world's longest land border. We have shared defense interests through NATO, shared air defense with NORAD. Are we like in the middle of a divorce? Like, how do you describe the relationship?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- I- we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in- in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time, that you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is- are important, that looking out for each other in important ways is- is a number one priority. I think in some quarters, Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through, I have no doubt about that, but it's yeah, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, you know, Canada had agreed to join this Board of Peace that President Trump announced out at Davos, and then overnight Thursday, the president disinvited Canada. Is this kind of public snub interfering in the relationship, and- and what does that indicate to you about what this Board of Peace is that Canada had said it did want to be a part of?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "So we had expressed an interest in the Board of Peace a number of weeks ago, and essentially, a Board of Peace that is seeking to find peace, in particular, in Gaza and stability, is something that Canada was very much supportive of. The- the parameters of that Board of Peace had just really started to come out and- and our government was considering it, but hadn't- hadn't really made a decision. But I think that- that honestly, I think that the most important thing to say here, from the perspective of Canada, is that we have always and will always be promoting peace and stability and human rights around the world. We'll do it with our allies in various fora, at NATO, at the U.N. bilaterally with like minded countries. So we're not going to change that and- and we will give it our all in- in any fora that- that is available to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It- It's kind of now described as an alternative to the United Nations. Is that something you're comfortable with?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, we are deep supporters of the United Nations. We feel that it's, you know, it's not perfect, no large institution is, but having a place where the whole world can get together and express their views on issues that are important to the globe is vital. And as I say, NATO is vital, and we work with our EU counterparts and EU-Canada, you know, security discussions and in- in various other configurations. So probably all of these different fora are- are essential. The Board of Peace has yet to be fully, I think, understood, and we'll see- we'll- we'll see where that goes, but the outcomes are what matter to Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So your prime minister gave a national address on Thursday, and I understand he denounced authoritarianism and exclusion. He did not mention President Trump by name, but he did rebuke the claim that Trump made at Davos, that Canada lives because of the United States. You're talking about what people receive at home, everyone has local politics, so when something like that is said, do you fear that this is starting not just a spat, but this is like a generational split between our two countries, like, how are people receiving this at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, I think Canadians- Canadians know that Canada lives because of Canadians, because what Canadians do for Canada, and right now, that's where we're trying to focus our attention. By doing what- you know, focusing our attention on what we can control as a nation for ourselves and our own economy and our own security and our own relationships around the world. The United States is always going to be a vital partner. Geography, as you said in your opener, 5,500 miles of border, deep ties, millions of Canadians and Americans that work together every day, that- that you know, do research and study and have families across the border so that- that is there, and that is something that I actually think brings strength to the relationship at times where, you know, in other- at other levels, and maybe at the political level, it- it's more complicated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It's very complicated. I mean, it- it's almost unthinkable that a phrase like authoritarianism and exclusion that that could be thought to be referring to the leader of the president of the United States?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, I think that there are concerns globally for- by our government, that we have institutions and norms, rules that have governed our countries, yours, mine, and all like minded countries for generations that are really being tested, really being tested. And- and I think what matters is how we react in the face of these tests, and for us, for our country, for our prime minister, you know, there are important implications for our country. And he's- he's trying to articulate a vision. And I think he is articulating a very strong vision for how we must adapt. And again, it's- it's about being pragmatic and principled, and that's- that's what we're going to continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You have had a long career here in the United States, deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration. President Trump was asked about it, January 13. He said, I really don't care in terms of renewing it, there's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here. Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico did broad consultations, national consultations, with their business communities in particular, on what- how that agreement works for them. And really without exception, the American comments back were sure we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit, but job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world. So I think there's- I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people in the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up, and they're saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So do you think there's a bilateral trade deal here? Is that what the Trump administration is going for, rather than the three way deal or--",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- you know, I think- I- I- we hear- we hear that sometimes, we hear different things. It is important to remember that even within that agreement, there are a lot of bilateral elements, but there is- there are advantages to doing things trilaterally. There's a lot of supply chain movement that happens between our three countries. And if you, if you break it into two, you could have different rules and disconnects there that are inefficient for business. So we're driven- look, Canada will be driven by what the best thing to do is, as I say, for the companies and constituencies that are relying on that agreement to create jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean, these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago, your prime minister was in Beijing, and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented, and it's very difficult. So that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean, the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values, and stand up to China. That seems dead, if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well, I think- I think we have to put this in perspective. The- the agreement that we did with China a few weeks ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely, or almost exclusively, designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from one of their primary markets, if not for some of them, their primary market. And so we went to Beijing to re-establish market access for our farmers and our fishers. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they re-established market access for U.S. soy farmers, and in exchange, rolled back some tariffs and fees. So this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But even Ontario's premier said this is letting Chinese \"spy cars\" into your country. I think he means electric vehicles that will be cheaply made in China. Are you worried about becoming too beholden to China and its cheap manufacturing?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, we're not, because, we- the- the auto side of this agreement was again to take us back to 2023, we had the importation of vehicles made in China. Many of those were Teslas, as a matter of fact, and we've gone back and stuck to the level of 2023 for those imports. So this isn't a revolutionary new thing. This is really just trying to roll back or de-escalate what had been escalated over the past year and a bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, the treasury secretary is saying that Albertans are going to have a referendum on succeeding from Canada. He seems to be urging that. What do you make of this--",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and comments like that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: I think it's important to let Albertans and Canadians manage their own very delicate domestic, you know, politics themselves. I think that that's probably wise counsel. Having grown up in Alberta, you know, it's a- it's a- it's a province that has lots of strong views about the way in which it interacts with the rest of the country, as do other parts of our nation. And those are important debates to be had, but they're debates for our country to have within its own citizenry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It seems to be stirring the pot there a bit, but I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos. He got a standing ovation for this speech. He described a ruptured global order, the end of a nice story, and the beginning of a new brutal reality, which he described as a predatory one. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "MARK CARNEY, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is: a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. What does this new world order look like?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think he laid out in his- his discussion, his speech, his- his view of what is happening in our world. And it's- it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stability and- and maximize economic reality. So we're moving away our economic benefits, and we're moving away from that, and we have to- countries like ours, have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles. We can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by by everyone if they commit to them. But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic and we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies, and part of that means engaging pragmatically with a broad array of countries around the world, in trade agreements, in investment relationships and in partnerships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sounds like Canada is picking off our friends.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I- no, I think Canada is trying to make sure that it is the most resilient it can be for our own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that President Trump posted on social media just a few moments ago that Canada is against the Golden Dome over Greenland and has voted against it to choose to be closer to China. That's how it was described to me. Yet President Trump had previously talked about Canada participating in this Golden Dome project, which isn't yet built, but it's supposed to be missile- layered missile defense, as I understand it. Do you know what he's talking about, that Canada has rejected being involved?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't, but what I can say about the Golden Dome is this, Canada is- is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defens-, in our defense systems, and a big part of that is Arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over-the-horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive. So that is part- and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug in to the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Right. Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems, where we're interoperable. We- we work together. We make our investments that make sense for Canada and defending our territory and defending our sovereignty, but we work with the Americans and- and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in- in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense, but you're on board to help do that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO, because you're also a partner at NATO. The only time that NATO's Article 5 was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan. Here's what President Trump said.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action. What is a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done, and I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true, and that's what matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time as it wraps up here in Washington.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Great to have you. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by the city's police chief, Brian O'Hara. Chief, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF, BRIAN O'HARA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened. Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened. Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a, in a law enforcement involved shooting, just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims. Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are, are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is",
      "this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that is the state agency that investigates use of force incidents--",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They are separate from your police force.",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves. I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city. So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just- there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already- the impression is left?",
      "O'HARA: People have had enough. This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out. This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "O'HARA: We understand that for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening. It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening. These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him. You said that Pretti- you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any, any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we checked the Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "O'HARA: Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun. \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\" The FBI director said, \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\" Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm, and there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of, shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions. He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly. He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "O'HARA: Well, that- what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police involved shootings from the scene. So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines, but- but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance if someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry. The only question would be if they were using the weapon in a- for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities. The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job. About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there. We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3000 as we understand it. The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that if those policies weren't in place, these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations, that none of this would really be happening. How do you respond to that claim that because of the sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades, and it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail that's at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "O'HARA: Yeah. I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard. As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis Police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin stretched as it is, and we have a job to do, trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office who had resigned. We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good. What is local law enforcement experiencing beyond your officers, but in the U.S. Attorney's Office, in your local FBI?",
      "O'HARA: I mean the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city. We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so- it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go to Independent Senator Angus King, who joins us from Maine.\u00a0 Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. ANGUS KING: Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state, ICE just launched this operation \"Catch of the Day,\" which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants, among others, targeting 1400 criminal aliens who have quote, unquote, terrorized communities in Maine. What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SEN. KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us- and by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established. They list 13 people in Maine. They concede that- or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are- I'm sorry, 87. My math is off. But the point is this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record, including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the at the- at the county jail. So this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the President. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me, I have to submit my questions in writing, and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be- I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers. But this- here's the real problem, Margaret, the people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking we're- we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets. Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their- to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this, and it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these- by these heavy handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of getting to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully, one of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it- job at the border. But they also point to Sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, you put your finger on it. Margaret in the last interview, the question is not, should we enforce the law? Should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals? The question is, how is it done? I did a little research this morning. Obama during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals, but you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I've never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from, the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and and we're having these incidents all over the country, so it's not necessary- you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and- and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SEN. KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last- the end of the last shutdown, but I can't vote for a bill that includes ace funding under the circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. There's an easy way out, by the way, Leader Thune could separate, which is what they did in the house, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS. And by the way, if those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's your path to avoid a shutdown. But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric in Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement, they're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: I guess I technically would, but I don't- again- well, let me, let me put it in the words of the sheriff in- in Cumberland County, Maine when they took one of his recruits, he called it 'bush league policing.' And I think that sort of summarizes it and- and there's no need for this overwhelming show of force. I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people. Again, armed people with masks and- and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing, and intimidating protesters. That's- that's not America. And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment. These people are acting outside the Constitution. They're ignoring our laws, and we just can't keep- keep supporting that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator King, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:02:14 -0500",
    "summary": "In his memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light,\" Pennsylvania's governor writes about how his childhood helped shape his lifetime of public service. He talks about the challenges he faced while growing up; the rise in political violence in America; and his future in the Democratic Party.",
    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro says it's special to visit his longtime congregation, Beth Sholom Synagogue, in the Philadelphia suburb of Elkins Park, which he's attended since he was young. He grew up coming here with his parents. His father, a pediatrician, and his mother, a teacher and activist, inspired him into a life of service.",
      "But we learned it was also his mom's struggles with mental health that may have had the most impact on Shapiro. \"There were moments where a switch could be flipped, and there'd be a lot of yelling and a lot of chaos and a lot of tumult in the house,\" he said. \"And you would just want to retreat to your room and try and escape it all.\"",
      "In his new memoir, \"Where We Keep the Light: Stories from a Life of Service\" (to be published Tuesday by HarperCollins), the 52-year-old governor details his childhood and his decades-long career.",
      "Shapiro writes that he had a happy childhood, and at points an unhappy childhood home \u2013 something he's never spoken about publicly. \"I wanted to share that, in part, because I know there's a lot of other families out there that go through this kind of stuff,\" he said. \"But in part, I want my mom to know that for as difficult as our childhood was at times, for as difficult as I imagine hers was, you know, she really set me on this path of service in a way that, you know, I hope she sees some of herself in, and I hope she takes pride in.\"",
      "Hard conversations",
      "The memoir begins with a deeply personal recounting of the arson attack on the governor's official residence in April 2025, while Shapiro and his family slept upstairs, hours after conducting a Passover seder.",
      "His son, Ruben, asked if someone tried to kill their family because they were Jewish.",
      "Shapiro said that conversation was really hard: \"We had to have some honest, tough conversations with our kids about what political violence is all about, and how it's designed to maybe target one person, but affect a broader swath of people based on a particular characteristic, perhaps in this case, our faith. And look, it's a hard thing for a parent to have that kind of conversation with their kids when they know in this business, they can't necessarily guarantee that level of safety.",
      "\"What I really hope for every day is that kids stop having to worry about that \u2014 not just my kids, but all people have to stop worrying that violence is gonna come to their community because of something they believe, or who they voted for, how they pray, who they love,\" he said.",
      "The arson attack occurred less than a year after Donald Trump, campaigning for president in Shapiro's state, had nearly been assassinated. I asked if political violence has changed how he carries out his work.",
      "\"I think political violence has gotten worse in this country since Butler,\" Shapiro replied. \"And I think it is only gonna get better when all politicians, all people condemn it universally, no matter who's the target of it, and no matter who carries it out. I don't care if you're a left-wing ideology, right-wing ideology; it should not be hard for us to say that it is all wrong.\"",
      "A new generation of the Democratic Party",
      "This year, Shapiro is in the middle of a re-election campaign, but he's also considered a top contender to represent the Democratic Party in 2028.",
      "We asked if the Democratic Party today has a clear set of ideals. \"I think the Democratic Party has a lot of clear ideals and wonderful values,\" Shapiro said. \"Otherwise I wouldn't be a member of this party.\"",
      "\"Are they articulating in a way, in a national message, that will win elections?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. I think folks are hoping that there will be one person every day, who's gonna go out and be the alternative to Donald Trump, or be the voice of the Democratic Party. And that one person certainly does not exist right now,\" Shapiro said. \"And that's okay, because there are wonderful Democrats who are governors, who are mayors, who are members of Congress, who are doing really good work every single day. And that work they're doing, I think, is helping shape and define the new generation of the Democratic Party.\"",
      "Right now, Shapiro is watching closely what's happening in Minneapolis with the president's immigration crackdown.",
      "\"The President claims it's all about safety,\" Shapiro said, adding, \"I think what the president's trying to do is show that he can be the dominant figure, that he can dictate behavior. Whether we're talking about Minneapolis or Greenland or Venezuela, this president wants to try and show what he believes to be strength that I think is a facade of strength and ultimately a veneer of strength. And ultimately what he's doing is making people worse off, less safe.\"",
      "What Governor Shapiro won't say is whether he will ultimately run for president himself. \"Here's what I can tell you with absolute certainty: I want to be a part of the dialog that helps shape us going forward into a party that can be one that helps people get a great education, that creates safer communities. I want to help build a Democratic Party that sees us as part of a world order, not going it alone. So yeah, I wanna be a part of shaping that dialog. And then ultimately from that dialogue that we have, there will be people who emerge, who ultimately want to lead that party. And that's a conversation for another day down the road.\"",

      "The Pentagon is asking military attorneys to travel to Minnesota on assignment to the U.S. Attorney's Office, CBS News has learned, after the Justice Department called for more resources to be surged to the state.",
      "The Justice Department is also in talks with the Pentagon to send some of its forensic auditors to Minnesota to assist with fraud investigations and potentially to testify in court, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The Pentagon request for attorneys seen by CBS News describes the short-term volunteer assignment, which would begin in March, as a detail to serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in the state. It does not specify the focus of the assignment or required subject matter experience. A U.S. official told CBS News the Justice Department has asked the Pentagon for additional attorneys.",
      "The call for resources comes as the Justice Department is continuing and expanding its investigation into COVID-era welfare fraud in Minnesota. Nearly all of the defendants accused or convicted of defrauding a federal program to feed hungry children are of Somali descent. The Trump administration often refers to it as \"Somali-fraud.\"",
      "The city of Minneapolis is also the center of the largest deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in its history, who are there both for the fraud probe and to carry out immigration enforcement as part of what the Trump administration has dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge.\"",
      "The effort has the support of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the source added.",
      "Last week, Minneapolis' top fraud prosecutor and several others resigned, in part over concern that the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent was not being probed as a civil rights case, and due to pressure to investigate Good's widow. The FBI is not currently investigating the agent who shot Good and prosecutors in the department's Civil Rights Division were previously ordered not to get involved.",
      "The additional resources from the Pentagon will help to augment the other efforts by the Justice Department to temporarily detail prosecutors from other neighboring districts in the coming weeks, including from parts of Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Wisconsin and North and South Dakota, the source added.",

On Thursday, a Justice Department spokesperson said in statement the department\u00a0\"is laser focused on rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse, and has already charged dozens of defendants from Minnesota who've defrauded the American people.\"",

      "U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the new framework could include a new NATO \"Arctic Sentry\" security partnership.",
      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",

      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",

      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Rufus Gifford also disputed\u00a0Mr. Trump's claim of a threat to the island from the U.S. adversaries.",

And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",

    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",

    "story": [
      "Police in Maine said all six people on a private business jet are presumed dead after the plane crashed in a snowstorm at Bangor International Airport.",
      "The Bombardier Challenger 600 crashed around 7:45 p.m. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.",
      "A preliminary\u00a0report posted online by the FAA had said there were seven fatalities after the plane \"came to rest inverted and caught fire.\" The FAA also previously said one crew member survived with serious injuries. However, the police later said that, according to the manifest, there were six people on the flight and they were all presumed to be deceased. The FAA deferred to local law enforcement and the NTSB.",
      "Records show that the plane was registered to a law firm based in Houston, Texas, CBS affiliate KHOU reported.",
      "The crash occurred as New England and much of the country grappled with a massive winter storm. Bangor had undergone steady snowfall Sunday along with many other parts of the country.",
      "There was no initial word on the plane's destination.",
      "The airport issued a statement that emergency crews were on the scene at the airport, which was closed after what it described as an incident involving a single aircraft departing the airport. It remained closed Monday morning, the Bangor Police Department said.",
      "The airport urged people to avoid the area and said the crash led to the cancellation of other flights.",
      "According to LiveATC.net, which broadcasts air traffic controllers' conversations, there was talk among the tower and planes minutes before the crash about visibility, though it wasn't clear which planes were involved.",
      "Then, one controller was heard saying there was \"a passenger aircraft upside down.\"",
      "The NTSB said it has no role in the release of information about victims and that such information is handled by local authorities. But airport director Jose Saavedra refused to comment, saying at a news conference Monday that he was \"awaiting guidance and support from federal partners.\"",
      "Bangor International Airport, some 200 miles north of Boston, offers direct flights to cities like Orlando, Florida, Washington, D.C., and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "The National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine, said the airport received nearly 10 inches of snow in total, though the snowfall was just beginning at the time of the crash.",
      "\"We have crews on site that respond to weather storms on a regular basis,\" Saavedra said. \"This is normal for us to respond to weather events.\"",
      "Throughout the weekend, the vast storm dumped sleet, freezing rain and snow across much of the eastern half of the U.S., halting much air and road traffic and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in the Southeast.",
      "Commercial air traffic was also heavily disrupted around much of the U.S.",
      "More than 11,000 flights were canceled Sunday and nearly 5,500 were delayed, according to the flight tracker flightaware.com. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey were among those impacted.",
      "The Bombardier Challenger 600 is a wide-bodied business jet configured for 9 to 11 passengers. It was launched in 1980 as the first private jet with a \"walk-about cabin\" and remains a popular charter option, according to aircharterservice.com.",
      "The airport in Bangor is by far the largest city in Maine's northern and eastern reaches. Its longstanding joint use agreement with the Maine Air National Guard means \"runways are ready rain or shine \u2013 or snow,\" an airport website says, under the phrase: \"A Little Snow Doesn't Scare Us.\"",
      "Jet has history of problems with ice, safety consultant says",
      "This particular plane model \"has a history of problems with icing on takeoff\" that has caused previous crashes, aviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti said. The former federal crash investigator said even a little bit of ice on the wings can cause serious problems, so this plane would have needed to be deiced before takeoff but it's not clear when or if that.",
      "The plane had just landed at Bangor from Houston at 6:09 p.m., according to\u00a0FlightRadar24.com, so it would have likely been sitting outside in the snow for more than an hour before it tried to takeoff again. And it wouldn't have taken long for ice to start building up on the wings \u2014 particularly if the plane was refueled with cold jet fuel that's stored in wing tanks, a factor the NTSB has cited in previous crashes.",
      "Airport officials said planes were being deiced at the airport at the time of the crash, but it wasn't immediately clear whether this particular plane was treated before it tried to take off.",
      "\"Given the weather conditions at the time, and the history of wind contamination with this particular aircraft, I'm sure that's something the NTSB is going to look into immediately,\" Guzzetti said. \"If there was any kind of precipitation at all, freezing precipitation, they would have needed to clean off those wings before they took off,\" he said",

      "The most popular wager for the Big Apple was in the 10- to 12-inch range. Shares predicting snowfall within that bracket were trading at 90 cents each Monday morning.",
      "The top bettor had purchased more than 8,100 shares, anticipating this outcome at 61 cents apiece. The same bettor had also wagered more than $1,000 on 12 to 14 inches of snowfall. Both bets remain active, meaning they have not yet been resolved because an outcome has not been determined.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:17:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Cardiologists say shoveling snow can increase a person's risk of experiencing a heart attack.",
    "story": [
      "As large parts of the U.S. dig out from\u00a0a major winter storm, health officials are renewing warnings about the serious and potentially deadly\u00a0risks of shoveling snow, which has been linked to\u00a0heart attacks.",
      "\"Snow shoveling is definitely associated with an increased risk of both heart attack and sudden cardiac death, especially in men and those with unknown cardiac coronary heart disease, or with multiple cardiac risk factors,\" said Christopher Kramer, a cardiologist and University of Virginia Health and the president of the American College of Cardiology.",
      "Cardiac risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, family history of heart disease, and tobacco use, as well as a sedentary lifestyle, Kramer told CBS News. He said the reason why shoveling snow can exacerbate them \"is complex,\" involving the type of exercise as well as the environment.",
      "The act of pushing and lifting snow can increase a person's heart rate and blood pressure even more than activities considered especially taxing, like running, said Kramer. And exposure to the cold only compounds the cardiac strain, as low temperatures alone can cause blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure to spike, which are risk factors for heart attacks.",
      "\"You have a dual problem, that you're increasing demand for oxygen because of the workload, and you're reducing supply because of the constriction of the blood vessels in the cold,\" Kramer said. \"So, you take someone who's not in shape, who has a lot of risk factors for heart disease, they're not getting regular exercise, and they go out on a very cold day and do what turns out to be one of the most vigorous forms of exercise you can do.\"",
      "A 2020 report by the\u00a0American Heart Association listed shoveling snow among the top physical activities that can place stress on the heart, particularly if a person is not accustomed to exercising. An updated warning from the association last month referenced numerous studies on the dangers of shoveling snow for people with and without heart disease.",
      "Three people died while trying to shovel and clear snow in Pennsylvania's Lehigh County during this latest storm,\u00a0CBS News Philadelphia reported, citing the county coroner's office. Their ages ranged from 60 to 84, and all three apparently experienced cardiac-related medical emergencies while shoveling.",
      "The coroner's report said their deaths were ruled natural and consistent with cardiac events that can occur during \"strenuous activity such as snow removal, particularly in older adults of those with underlying health conditions.\"",
      "One of the station's meteorologists, Bill Kelly, urged people in the area to take precautions\u00a0when it comes to clearing their sidewalks or driveways. He noted they were expecting a layer of sleet and freezing rain on top of the snow.",
      "\"If you go out and you shovel that, halfway through, if you shovel often, you're going to get a fresh layer of sleet and ice on the ground,\" Kelly said. \"The good news is, smaller doses of exertion. That's good. But the layer of ice is going to be hard to clean as it gets going.\"",
      "In Minnesota, which also saw significant snowfall and extremely cold temperatures, cardiologist Josh Buckler emphasized the importance of staying safe when it comes to temperature drops, physical exertion and heart health.",
      "\"I tell all my patients: Be cautious with shoveling,\" Buckler told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota\u00a0before the winter storm arrived. \"There's some really great data that shows that for every 2-degree drop, after about 0 degrees, the heart attack risk goes up by about 2%. And that risk lasts for about 28 days afterwards.\"",
      "A Canadian study published in 2017 found that heavy snowfall of about 8 inches in a particular area corresponded with a 16% increased risk of cardiac-related hospitalizations and a 34% increased risk of death from heart attacks in men.",
      "Kramer said the gender-specific figure could simply be due to the fact that men took on the duty of shoveling most often.",
      "To lower the chances of experiencing a heart attack, he recommends people with cardiac risk factors take breaks while shoveling snow, or better yet, avoid the task altogether.",
      "\"If you have these risk factors, pay the kid down the street to shovel your walk. Don't do it,\" he said. \"If you have to do it, take breaks.\"",

Or maybe they'll take this song and play it for somebody and say, 'I don't have the words, but this is how I feel.'\"",
      "\"Changed my life\"",
      "Even though the song was intended to help anyone in need, there was one person in particular who Tracy Hargen really wanted to reach: Everett.",
      "\"I wasn't even sure if I had the right number anymore, but I texted and said, 'Be sure to hear the shout out to the teacher in the chorus,'\" she said in her message to Everett.",

      "\"Thank you so much for sending me this song. It has really been warming my heart today,\" Everett told her.",
      "Nearly a decade later, William Hargen and Everett had the opportunity to reunite.",
      "William Hargen wanted Everett to know how their kindness impacted his life.",
      "\"That changed my life,\" he said. \"I think you should really know that I'm not mincing words at all, meant the entire world to me.\"",

      "Walz's office also said that Mr. Trump agreed to speak with Department of Homeland Security officials \"about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, on his Truth Social network, posted that Walz \"(requested) to work together with respect to Minnesota.\" He went on to say that he and Walz \"seemed to be on a similar wavelength,\" and added \"I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that.\"",
      "Walz's office says the governor also took time to remind Mr. Trump that \"the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a U.S. citizen.

    "summary": "Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The threat of a partial government shutdown looms large this week after Senate Democrats came out against a funding package in the wake of the deadly shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal agents, with just days until the deadline to fund the government.",
      "For weeks, lawmakers in both parties and across both chambers have been working to pass individual funding measures before government funding lapses on Friday, Jan. 30.",
      "Six of the 12 appropriations bills have already cleared both chambers and been signed into law. And the Senate was expected this week to take up the remaining six funding measures, which passed the House earlier this month and were grouped together to secure swifter passage through the upper chamber.",
      "The remaining six bills include funding for the departments of Defense; Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; State; and Treasury and other related agencies. And crucially, funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and Border Patrol, is part of the six-bill package.",
      "Now, the grouping of those funding measures is creating complications in the Senate, after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents led a slew of Senate Democrats to oppose any funding package that includes DHS. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that Democrats would not provide the necessary votes to advance the package to fund the remaining government agencies and programs if DHS funding is included. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary to reach a 60-vote threshold to advance the legislation.",
      "Even independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who was among a trio of senators who crossed the aisle to negotiate a deal with Republicans to reopen the government during the longest shutdown in history last year, said he won't vote for a package that includes the DHS measure.",
      "\"I hate shutdowns,\" King said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"But I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances.\"",
      "Still, King, who caucuses with Democrats, argued that \"there's an easy way out\" of the funding fight, saying Senate Majority Leader John Thune should separate the DHS bill from the other five funding measures.",
      "\"If those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded,\" King said. \"Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem.\"",
      "King joined a number of Senate Democrats advocating for the approach. And later Sunday, Schumer signaled Democrats more broadly would be willing to move forward with the other five funding bills.",
      "\"Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill,\" Schumer said in a statement, calling it the \"best course of action.\"",
      "In another statement Monday, Schumer put pressure on Senate GOP leaders to move forward with the funding bills without the DHS funds.",
      "\"The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,\" Schumer said. \"If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.\"",
      "But whether the will exists among Senate Republicans to strip out the DHS funding bill from the broader package, which would require unanimous consent, remains to be seen. Heading into the week, GOP Senate leaders were expected to move forward as planned. Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week.",
      "The DHS bill was considered separately from the other funding bills in the House last week after many Democrats said they would not support it because it did not include extensive reforms to ICE, following the first deadly shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis. The measure ultimately picked up support from seven House Democrats.",
      "House and Senate appropriators released the text of the DHS funding measure, along with three other measures, last week.",
      "At the time, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democratic appropriators, characterized the DHS measure as a positive step, while acknowledging that it fell short of the reforms that Democrats had sought. And they argued that neither a continuing resolution to keep the government funded nor a government shutdown would rein in ICE due to funding allocated in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, making an alternative strategy in the funding fight futile.",
      "Ultimately, DeLauro voted against the bill that she had negotiated, while Murray has pledged to do the same.",
      "\"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" Murray said in a post on X pledging to oppose the measure. \"The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate \u2014 Republicans must work with us to do that.\"",
      "Some Senate Republicans have spoken out following Saturday's shooting, including Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who called the events in Minneapolis \"incredibly disturbing,\" while arguing that the \"credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake\" and calling for a joint federal and state investigation. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina likewise called for \"thorough and impartial investigation,\" as did Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who said a \"comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work.\" Sens. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania and Jon Husted of Ohio later joined the calls for an investigation into the incident.",
      "Whether more Republicans follow suit, or go further, remains an open question.",
      "Adding to the difficulties for the Senate this week is a winter storm in Washington. Though the Senate had been set to return Monday for votes, senators are now set to return Tuesday afternoon due to the weather, shortening the already tight timeline to avert a partial shutdown by the week's end.",
      "Should senators be unable to approve additional funding, agencies and programs would begin to shut down after Jan. 30. But the shutdown would differ from the one that stretched through October and into November since some appropriations bills have already passed both chambers and been signed into law.",
      "Funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch passed as part of the deal to reopen the government in November and was signed into law. Funding for the departments of Commerce and Justice; Interior and the EPA as well as energy and water development has also passed both chambers and was signed into law last week, meaning they would continue to operate like usual even as other parts of the government shut down.",

      "The Treasury Department said in a new release on Monday that the tax return leak affected roughly 406,000 people, citing IRS data. The agency did not note Littlejohn's release of Mr. Trump's tax info.",
      "\"President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement. \"Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service.\"",

      "\"It's indeed been absolutely devastating and very surreal to see our Alex have such a terrible, tragic end,\" Dr. Aasma Shaukat said of the deadly shooting during an interview on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "A few years after graduating from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, Pretti got a job as a research assistant at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. Shaukat said she hired Pretti in 2014 to work on research studies and \"got nothing but good reviews\" as he helped enroll veterans into the program.",
      "When Pretti expressed an interest in nursing school, Shaukat said the staff fully supported him, writing letters of recommendation for his application and making his work schedule more flexible so he could juggle classes and his position as a research scientist. He eventually got a job as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.",

      "Shaukat said she wasn't surprised to see Pretti protesting federal immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, saying he was always \"very strong on his values\" and had \"a lot of compassion.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says Border Patrol officers acted in self-defense Saturday after Pretti approached them with a handgun, but did not say whether he \"brandished\" the weapon. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino claims \"defensive shots\" were fired after Pretti \"violently resisted\" disarmament. Pretti had a permit to carry and no criminal record. Minnesota officials say videos from the scene contradict the agency's account of the encounter.",
      "Videos show Pretti holding up a cellphone moments before he was fatally shot. Like many, Shaukat said she watched footage of Pretti's final moments.",
      "\"Now, Alex was of a slight build, so in no way, shape or form was he ever threatening. He doesn't look like he's kicking or, you know, trying to fight back,\" she said after watching videos of the scene. \"He's essentially just, you know, trying \u2013 he's completely defenseless, and then he's shot. It is just horrific to see.\"",

      "The precious metal topped $5,100 in trading on Monday, while silver and platinum also reached all-time highs, surpassing $100 and $2,800, respectively. Gold has nearly doubled from a year ago, when it traded for around $2,660.",
      "Monday's rally came after President Trump said over the weekend that he would impose a\u00a0100% import tax on Canada if the country strikes a trade deal with China. That followed a separate threat by Mr. Trump to impose levies on eight\u00a0European nations over their objections to his efforts to acquire Greenland.",
      "The president eventually relented on those tariff threats after announcing that he and the secretary-general of NATO had agreed on the contours of a deal over Greenland.",
      "Uncertainty drives gold prices",

      "The surge in gold is also rooted in concern over government borrowing, as debt levels across the U.S. and other major economies continue to mount.

    "story": [
      "Soon after Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent, top Trump administration officials made sweeping, categorical statements about the deadly shooting before a full investigation had begun.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said the Border Patrol agent fired \"defensive shots,\" fearing for his life because Pretti had a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti intended to \"kill\" and \"inflict maximum damage.\" Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said Pretti planned to \"massacre\" federal agents. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin.\"",
      "These statements by senior administration officials, many of which have been directly contradicted by videos of the incident and witness accounts, have caused internal frustration among some at DHS who are increasingly concerned about the agency's reputation, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation told CBS News.",
      "One U.S. government official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said top DHS officials were mishandling the public messaging around the deadly incident, making statements that were not supported by concrete evidence, before any investigative findings came out.",
      "\"It's unclear who at DHS thought it would be a good idea to make such claims before any facts were established, but it was a terrible miscalculation,\" the U.S. official said.",
      "A Homeland Security official who works on immigration enforcement expressed concern about the possibility of \"self-inflicted reputational harm\" being caused by the \"strong language\" used by top officials following Pretti's killing.",
      "\"When we gaslight and contradict what the public can plainly see with their own eyes, we lose all credibility and it's going to damage our reputation for generations,\" the DHS official said, also requesting anonymity because this official is not authorized to talk to the press.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"Nobody, including President Trump, wants to see people get shot or hurt.\"",
      "\"That's exactly why Governor Walz and Mayor Frey need to allow local police to work with federal law enforcement to remove illegal alien criminals, murderers, and pedophiles from Minnesota,\" Leavitt added.",
      "The frustrations inside DHS come amid a shift in public opinion toward President Trump's deportation efforts. A CBS News poll earlier this month found that Americans' support for his deportation campaign had fallen to 46%, down from 59% at the start of his administration. The poll also found 61% of those surveyed believe immigration agents are being \"too tough.\"",
      "A former senior Border Patrol official who continues to be in touch with current agency personnel said many still \"believe in the overall effort.\"",
      "\"But what is being done is starting to lose them,\" the former official said, noting the \"initial narrative\" from DHS about the shooting \"undermines our credibility.\"",
      "\"They feel caught in the middle with harmful rhetoric on both sides,\" the former official said.",
      "\"A horrible situation for everyone\"",
      "The shooting of 37-year-old Pretti has further inflamed tensions in Minneapolis, which has been the focus of the deployment of federal agents so far under President Trump's nationwide campaign against illegal immigration. It came less than three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good, another U.S. citizen and Minneapolis resident.",
      "In Good's case, top Trump administration officials also made broad accusations early on, branding her a \"domestic terrorist\" and alleging that she had sought to injure the ICE officer. Lawyers representing Good's family have said the Minneapolis mother and her partner were observing ICE activity.",
      "Videos of the latest shooting show Pretti standing in the middle of a street holding up his phone toward Border Patrol agents. After he and several others were pushed back, he was sprayed with a chemical agent before being wrestled to the ground by agents and appeared to struggle as they tried to bring his arms behind his back. He was then shot multiple times.",
      "While DHS alleged that Pretti \"approached\" officers with a handgun and \"violently resisted\" when agents tried to disarm him, videos reviewed by CBS News do not show Pretti with a gun in his hand before he's shot. Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "How the incident is being investigated is also raising questions. U.S. officials and FBI Director Kash Patel said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch has taken the lead role investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual. Instead of tasking an outside entity to probe the shooting, they noted, ICE would be tasked with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "As in the Good case, Minnesota state officials have said they've been blocked from accessing evidence needed to investigate Pretti's shooting. Over the weekend, a federal judge barred DHS from altering or destroying evidence of the incident. The judge is holding a hearing on the case later Monday.",
      "A Border Patrol official who was granted anonymity to speak freely said the Trump administration should wait for an investigation before making definitive statements about Pretti's killing, calling the shooting \"a horrible situation for everyone.\"",
      "The official said immigration agents are facing an \"extremely difficult situation\" in the field, citing instances of them getting attacked or obstructed while on the job.",
      "Border Patrol agents, the official argued, have been \"beat up\" by both sides of the political spectrum in recent years. First, by some conservatives, who accused them of being complicit in the crisis at the U.S. southern border under former President Joe Biden and now, by liberals angry over President Trump's deportation crackdown.",
      "\"We are being politicized and that's not the job we signed up for,\" the Border Patrol official said.",

      "Deep freeze grips the South",
      "Before moving northeast, the winter storm brought an unusually fierce deep freeze to a wide expanse of the South.",
      "In Shelby County, Texas, near the Louisiana border, ice weighed down on pine trees and caused branches to snap, downing power lines. About a third of the county's 16,000 electric customers lost power on Saturday.",
      "\"We have hundreds of trees down and a lot of limbs in the road,\" Shelby County Commissioner Stevie Smith said from his pickup truck. \"I've got my crew out clearing roads as fast as we can. It's a lot to deal with right now.\"",
      "At least two people died in the Lone Star State: one in Austin and another, a 16-year-old girl, was killed in a sledding accident in Frisco, according to local authorities. An elderly man in Colleyville, Texas, northeast of Fort Worth, was hospitalized after being found in a pond in freezing conditions on Sunday morning, CBS Texas reported.",
      "As of Sunday night, two deaths were reported in Louisiana that resulted from the winter weather, three in Tennessee and one in Kansas, where a missing woman found dead in the snow in Emporia, authorities said.",
      "There were reports of vehicles hitting fallen trees and trees falling onto houses in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, where more than half of all electric customers lost power.",
      "\"We got limbs that are dragging the ground,\" said Mark Pierce, a spokesperson for the local sheriff's office. \"These trees are just completely saturated with ice.\"",
      "In Louisville, Kentucky, emergency services on Saturday handled more than 850 calls regarding collisions, stranded motorists and other emergencies related to exposure to cold, officials said, noting that the actual number could be even higher.",
      "Officials in Georgia advised people in the state's northern regions to get off the roads Saturday and be prepared to stay put for at least 48 hours.",
      "In Rabun County, one of the hardest hit parts of Georgia, officials say they've had fallen trees and downed power lines, along with icy and hazardous roadways around the county. Even when the storm moves out of the area, officials are warning residents not to get on the roads, as below-freezing temperatures will cause ice to reform, making travel dangerous, CBS Atlanta reported.",
      "After earlier putting 500 National Guard members on standby, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced Saturday that he was deploying 120 of them to northeast Georgia \"to further strengthen our response in the hardest hit areas.\"",
      "\"We're about halfway through this event. I know that some people may be waking up and saying 'There's nothing out there,' because we are in a little bit of a lull,\" Kemp said Sunday. \"There's more coming. We do think things will deteriorate as the day goes on.\"",
      "Churches moved Sunday services online, and the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, decided to hold its Saturday night radio performance without fans. Mardi Gras parades in Louisiana were canceled or rescheduled.",
      "Jami Joe of Nashville, 41, feared her electricity might not last as ice-heavy limbs from oak and pecan trees continued to crash around her house. \"It's only a matter of time if a limb strikes a power line,\" she said.",
      "Nashville Electric Service said Sunday afternoon there were nearly 200,000 customers there without power and warned the outages could last days or longer.",
      "School closings were already announced for Monday in numerous cities, including Dallas, Houston and Memphis.",
      "Some universities in the South canceled classes for Monday, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Mississippi's main campus in Oxford.",
      "Oxford Utility crews were also pulled from their jobs during the overnight hours. At least 180,000 customers across the state of Mississippi do not have power, Gov. Tate Reeves said at a news conference Sunday afternoon.",
      "\"Due to life-threatening conditions, Oxford Utilities has made the difficult decision to pull our crews off the road for the night,\" the utility company posted on Facebook early Sunday. \"Trees are actively snapping and falling around our linemen while they are in the bucket trucks.\"",
      "Oxford city officials posted photos on social media of slick roads and ice-coated trees sagging or breaking under the added weight.",
      "\"We haven't seen a storm of this magnitude, in terms of ice, since 1994,\" Reeves said, but he said he doesn't anticipate the need to call in the National Guard at this time.",
      "After the storm in 1994, some locals remembered being without power for weeks. During the press conference on Sunday, the governor was asked how long it would take for power to be restored, especially in harder hit areas, but said he didn't want to \"begin to try to forecast or estimate when some of the power can or cannot be put back on.\"",
      "Reeves said he is requesting help from FEMA to send cots and food to warming shelters, as well as generators to long-term care facilities and hospitals that don't have adequate backup generators.",
      "On the highways, crews clearing downed trees were feeling overwhelmed.",
      "\"We're spread thin on equipment here, because there's so many guys in different directions and we're out here having to mainly do this where usually we would need a backhoe or bulldozer, something to help move this stuff,\" said John Sanford, a road worker with the Mississippi Department of Transportation. \"One of the guys that worked with us, he couldn't make it back this morning. He's got two trees on his house.\"",
      "Asked what the biggest challenges were with clearing the roads, Sanford replied, \"No sleep, the cold, the rain, you know, just getting exhausted... You just get physically tired and you know, there's more and more trees falling, people needing help. The minute you get one cleaned up, another one falls.\"",
      "In New Albany, Mississippi, resident Eddie Swords said the constant cracking limbs and falling trees \"sound like a firecracker popping.\"",
      "He added, \"The first one fell last night, I thought, 'Who's shooting firecrackers this time of night?' They go 'pop, pop.'\"",
      "Swords said the power was out at his house, but he has a generator at his home, \"thank goodness.\" One of his friends \u2014 who he said helped him chainsaw a path in and out of his neighborhood so they could get fuel \u2014 will be staying over to keep warm.",
      "\"I told anybody who wants to come down, 'I got natural gas that's good and toasted in there right now,'\" Swords said.",

      "Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold. Two stingy defenses. A second-year head coach vs. a veteran coach in his second act.",
      "The Patriots will seek their NFL-record seventh Super Bowl victory when they face the Seahawks on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.",
      "Led by Maye, coach Mike Vrabel and a stifling defense, the Patriots are back in the Super Bowl for the first time since Tom Brady and Bill Belichick won their sixth ring together seven years ago.",
      "The Patriots beat the Denver Broncos 10-7 on Sunday in the AFC championship game to advance to their 12th Super Bowl.",
      "Darnold, Mike Macdonald and a suffocating defense have led the Seahawks to the big stage for the fourth time in franchise history. They're seeking their second Lombardi.",
      "Darnold, a No. 3 overall pick in 2018 now with his fifth team, played one of his best games to lead the Seahawks to a 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC title game. He threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers.",
      "\"That doesn't matter to me,\" Darnold said about the doubters he's proven wrong. \"I just come to work every single day with these guys. These guys in the locker room, that's what it's about to me, man. The way we've come to work ever since April in OTAs, training camp, one day at a time and we're here. We did it.\"",
      "It was a wacky finish when Brady and the Patriots beat Russell Wilson and Pete Carroll's Seahawks 11 years ago.",
      "Brady threw four TD passes and rallied New England from a 10-point deficit to win the fourth of his seven rings when Malcolm Butler intercepted Wilson's pass from the 1-yard line to secure a 28-24 victory on Feb. 1, 2015. Seattle fans still lament why Marshawn Lynch didn't get the ball on a handoff at the 1.",
      "\"We did not care,\" Macdonald said about coming into the season as underdogs in the NFC West behind the Rams and 49ers. \"It's about us. It's always been about us and what we do and now we're going to the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Maye scored on a 6-yard touchdown run in the second quarter in Denver after a critical turnover by Jarrett Stidham, who made his fifth career start filling in for injured Broncos quarterback Bo Nix.",
      "\"The Pats are back, baby,\" Maye said. \"Now, gotta win one.\"",
      "Maye was asked about the team's past playoff record against Denver: New England had never beaten the Broncos in four postseason games, CBS News Boston pointed out.",
      "\"It's a new team, it's a new era. I respect and appreciate what the Patriots dynasty did. Unfortunately they didn't come out with any wins here. We changed that narrative. Look forward to bringing our best football for Santa Clara,\" Maye said.",
      "Playing through a snowstorm in the second half, Maye only threw for 86 yards and ran for 65. Stidham had 133 yards passing and one TD, one interception and one costly fumble.",
      "The 23-year-old Maye, a finalist for AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year, will become the second-youngest QB to start a Super Bowl behind Dan Marino. He's the fourth second-year QB in the past seven years to lead his team to the NFL title game. Patrick Mahomes (2018) won it while Joe Burrow (2021) and Brock Purdy (2023) lost.",
      "Vrabel, who won three Super Bowls as a linebacker for the Patriots in the 2000s, turned the team around in his first season as coach. New England went from 4-13 last year under Jerod Mayo to 14-3.",
      "Vrabel is trying to become the first person to win a Super Bowl as a head coach and player for the same team. Tom Flores, Mike Ditka, Tony Dungy and Doug Pederson won Super Bowls playing for one team and coaching another.",
      "\"I can't tell you how proud I am to be associated with these guys and this organization,\" said Vrabel, who is a finalist for AP NFL Coach of the Year. \"I won't win it. It'll be the players that'll win the game, I promise you. It won't be me that'll win it and I promise you I'll do everything that I can and our staff to have them ready for the game.\"",
      "No team has played in the Super Bowl more than the Patriots, who are 6-5. They're tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most wins.",
      "It's been a long road back to the top for New England, which came off consecutive four-win seasons and only had one winning season after Brady's departure in 2020.",
      "The Patriots have averaged just 18 points per game in the playoffs, the fewest by any team to make the Super Bowl since the 1979 Rams, who averaged 15. New England's defense has allowed just 26 points in the three games, an average of just 8.7 per game.

Ice was also covering roads and bridges in parts of Mississippi, according to Scott Simmons, a spokesman for Mississippi's emergency management agency.",

      "Officials are particularly concerned about power outages. Ice is heavier than snow, and its weight on power lines may lead to widespread outages. In at least 11 Southern states, the majority of homes are heated by electricity, raising the possibility of dangerously cold conditions during an outage.",
      "\"Once we get more than about a quarter inch of ice on those lines, the lines either start sagging and failing, or more likely, you actually get the vegetation above it, the trees, to fall on the lines, and that causes potentially a larger number of outages,\" said Thomas Overbye, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&M University.",
      "Chris Johnson, the assistant director of operations and field services at Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, told CBS News that his \"biggest concern\" is power outages followed by frigid temperatures. More than 200 people died when a 2021 ice storm in Texas knocked out power for days.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/x-grok-ai-imagery-elon-musk-eu-uk-us-regulation/",
    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

    "summary": "Israel's military says the remains of Ran Gvili, the last person whose body was taken hostage into Gaza, have been recovered.",
    "story": [
      "Israel said Monday that the remains of the last hostage in Gaza had been recovered, clearing the way for the next phase of the ceasefire that stopped the Israel-Hamas war. The announcement came a day after Israel's government said the military was conducting a \"large-scale operation\" in a cemetery in northern Gaza to locate the remains of Ran Gvili.",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire's first phase, and Gvili's family had urged Israel's government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.",
      "In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said representatives had informed Gvili's family \"that their loved one has been identified and is being buried.\"",
      "\"With this, all of the abductees have been returned from the Gaza Strip,\" the IDF said.",
      "Israel and Hamas have been under pressure from ceasefire mediators, including the Trump administration, to move into the second phase of the U.S.-brokered truce, which took effect on Oct. 10.",
      "Israel had repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas had said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili's remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.",
      "Both sides have accused the other of violations of the ceasefire since it came into effect, and dozens of Palestinians have been killed since October, including three journalists killed in an Israeli strike\u00a0last week, one of whom had worked extensively for CBS News.",
      "Israel's military said of that attack, as it has other deadly instances during the ceasefire, that it was investigating, but claimed its forces had struck suspects who posed a threat to the safety of troops.",
      "In a statement on Monday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the recovery of Gvili's body, \"confirms Hamas's commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement. Hamas will continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "Israel's military had said the large-scale operation to locate Gvili's remains was \"in the area of the Yellow Line,\" which has divided the territory since the ceasefire came into effect.",
      "The ceasefire deal aims to wind down the war that was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 people were killed in the territory during the war, a figure which CBS News cannot independently verify and which Israel disputes, though the United Nations considers it the most accurate death toll estimate available.",
      "Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer known affectionately as \"Rani,\" was killed while fighting Hamas militants during the attack.",
      "Before Gvili's remains were recovered, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others had been returned to Israel during the ceasefire, most recently in early December. Israel in exchange has released the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians to Gaza.",
      "The next phase of the 20-point ceasefire plan calls for creating an international stabilization force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.",
      "President Trump has warned repeatedly that if Hamas refuses to disarm in line with the agreement, \"there will be hell to pay.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has launched his new international Board of Peace initiative, inviting dozens of nations to join his administration on a vaguely defined mission to end conflicts in the Middle East, and suggesting ambitions beyond the region.",
      "While the Board of Peace was often mentioned by Mr. Trump as an entity that would focus on rebuilding the decimated Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory is was not mentioned explicitly in the board's founding charter, signed by Mr. Trump and about 20 other national leaders during the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.",
      "European nations, America's oldest and closest allies, have thus far declined to join the board, and major rival powers China and Russia have also adopted a wait-and-see approach to the initiative.",

It said the deployment was \"to promote regional security and stability.\"",

      "Vine was knocked from his bike when two large kangaroos bounced onto the road on a high-speed section with about 96 kilometers (61 miles) left in the undulating 169.8 kilometer (105 mile) stage through the hills around Adelaide.",
      "Video of the incident posted by SBS Sport showed Vine and other cyclists on the ground as the kangaroo hops across the road, trying to avoid a throng of competitors. One social media commenter called it \"the most Australian crash I've ever seen.\"",
      "Three riders \u2014 Menno Huising, Lucas Stevenson and Alberto Dainese \u2014 were forced to quit the race and the kangaroo also was injured.",
      "Vine led the race by 1 minute, 3 seconds on general classification entering the last stage.

      "Juan Sebastian Molano also abandoned the tour Sunday because of fatigue, leaving Vine with only two teammates on the last stage: Ivo Emanuel Oliveira and Briton Adam Yates.",
      "Vine got up immediately after his crash and changed bikes twice before rejoining the peloton with around 92 kilometers remaining.",
      "He remained near the front of the peloton for the rest of the stage and finished 1 minute, 3 seconds ahead of Mauro Schmid of Switzerland (Team Jayco Alula) and Harry Sweeny (EF Education - Easypost) of Australia, who was a further nine seconds behind.",
      "\"Everyone asks me what's the most dangerous thing in Australia and I always tell them it's kangaroos,\" said Vine, who won his home race for the second time in three years. \"They wait and they hide in the bushes until you can't stop and they jump out in front of you. Point proven today.",
      "\"Two of them blasted through the peloton when we were doing probably 50 kph (30 mph) and one of them stopped and went left, right, left right, left right and I ended up hitting its backside.\"",
      "One of the kangaroos was euthanized and the second one escaped, apparently unharmed, according to Canadian Cycling Magazine.",
      "Matthew Brennan of Britain (Team Visma) won the stage in a sprint ahead of Finn Fisher-Black of New Zealand (Bora Hansgrohe) and Tobias Lund Andresen of Denmark (Decathlon).",
      "\"It wasn't ideal,\" Brennan told local media after the finish. \"We had Menno [Huising] who usually coordinates a lot [of the lead out for the sprint], but he got smacked on by a kangaroo, so that wasn't great.\"",
      "The stage covered eight laps of a circuit which involved a slow, steep climb to the finish in the township of Stirling. There were two breakaways during the stage, the second of which came back to the peloton with only one kilometer remaining.",
      "Vine managed to overcome an enormous amount of bad luck to win the race.",

      "Manila, Philippines \u2014 A ferry with more than 350 people on board sank early Monday near an island in the southern Philippines, killing at least 18 people, officials said. Rescuers saved hundreds more, while a fleet of coast guard and naval ships searched for those still missing.",
      "Coast guard officials said the cargo and passenger ferry apparently encountered technical problems and sank after midnight. The steel-hulled vessel abruptly tilted to one side and took on water, hurling people into the sea in the darkness, according to a rescued passenger who lost his 6-month-old baby.",
      "\"My wife lost hold of our baby and all of us got separated at sea,\" a distraught Mohamad Khan told a volunteer rescuer, Gamar Alih, who posted a video of Khan's remarks on Facebook.",

      "\"There were two coast guard safety officers on board and they were the first to call and alert us to deploy rescue vessels,\" Dua said, adding that the two safety marshals survived.",
      "Rescuers saved at least 316 passengers and crewmembers retrieved 18 bodies, officials said. Coast guard and navy ships, along with a surveillance plane, an air force Black Hawk helicopter and fleets of fishing boats carried out search and rescue operations for about two dozen people believed missing off Basilan, Dua said.",
      "The cause of the ferry sinking was not immediately clear and there will be an investigation, Dua said. The coast guard had cleared the ferry before it left the Zamboanga port, and there was no sign of overloading, he said.",
      "Local media reported that up to 15 passengers on the ship's manifest decided not to board at the last minute and refunded their fare. If confirmed, that would reduce the number of missing, Dua said.",
      "Alih, a village councilor from Zamboanga city, told The AP Press that he volunteered to help in the search and rescue because some of his relatives were among the ferry passengers. They all survived.",

    "story": [
      "Climber Alex Honnold has completed a free solo ascent of Taipei 101 in Taiwan, not using any ropes to scale the massive 1,667-foot skyscraper \u2014 and he did it live, as the world watched on with bated breath and hearts racing.",
      "It took Honnold 1 hour and 31 minutes to climb the 101-floor tower and spire on Sunday. The event was livestreamed on Netflix.",
      "\"It's windy,\" Honnold said at the top before taking a selfie. \"I'm so psyched ... And you know what, pretty tired actually.\"",
      "Honnold's climb was originally slated for the previous day, Jan. 23, but was postponed due to bad weather, Netflix said. \"I suppose climbing is always at the mercy of nature, that's just how it goes,\" Honnold said in a\u00a0video posted on social media.",
      "Ahead of the climb, Honnold told Netflix's Tudum fan site he expected viewers to \"probably be on edge watching this,\" but that he hoped they \"get a little bit of my joy from the experience \u2014 that they can appreciate the fun of it and the beauty of it, the scenery, just the whole experience.\"",
      "Taipei 101 is one of the\u00a0tallest skyscrapers in the world. The building was designed by C.Y. Lee & Partners and opened in 2004. It's home to observatories, restaurants, a shopping mall and offices, as well as the Taiwan Stock Exchange.",
      "Frenchman Alain Robert scaled the tower as part of its opening. Robert used ropes, and it took him more than four hours, Honnold told Tudum. \"I think, if I do this, it'll be the biggest urban free solo ever,\" he added.",
      "Honnold also famously climbed El Capitan without any ropes or safety gear in June 2017. El Capitan is a roughly 3,000-foot sheer granite wall \u2014 more than twice the height of the Empire State Building \u2014 in the northern valley of Yosemite National Park in California. His incredible feat was captured in the Oscar-winning documentary \"Free Solo.\"",
      "That free solo up the Freerider route took Honnold 3 hours and 56 minutes. The following year, Honnold and fellow climber Tommy Caldwell climbed El Capitan's Nose route in 1 hour, 58 minutes and 7 seconds, shattering the previous speed record and breaking the two-hour barrier.",
      "In a \"Note to Self\" on \"CBS Mornings\" in 2018, Honnold reflected on what it took to climb El Capitan without any ropes, telling his 18-year-old self: \"Right now, you're afraid of so many things: strangers, girls, vegetables, falling to your death. That's fine; fear is a perfectly natural part of life. You will always feel fear.\"",
      "\"But over time you will realize that the only way to truly manage your fears is to broaden your comfort zone,\" he said. \"It's a long, slow process that requires constantly pushing yourself, but eventually you'll feel pretty darn good, and you'll climb big walls just like this.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who joins us from New Orleans. Good morning to you.",
      "HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STEVE SCALISE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know in addition to being a leader in Congress, you have this unique experience of having been the victim of political violence yourself. You know how dangerous rhetoric can be. We've heard a lot of anger in the past 24 hours, and your fellow Louisianan Senator Bill Cassidy said the events in Minneapolis are not only incredibly disturbing, but the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. He called for a joint federal and state investigation. Would you join his call?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I don't question the credibility of ICE. They're doing an incredibly hard job. They're- look we are all, just feel sorry about what happened in Minneapolis. And this has happened over and over again. I mean, I'm not just talking about regarding ICE. I mean, they've got some failed local leadership. They let their city burn down years ago. They have chaos, it seems like all the time in places where other cities don't. ICE is operating in a lot of cities, Margaret, and you don't have these kind of incidents in any other city but Minneapolis--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You don't- don't see these numbers either?-- .",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- and so, I wish yesterday didn't happen. What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see these numbers either, though, when we looked at, for example, at the federal response in New Orleans. I mean, it's just a fraction of the number of federal agents. Nearly 3,000 is quite a lot for a city the size of Minneapolis.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, that's because they didn't get resistance in cities like New Orleans, where, you know, when you look in Minneapolis, and I just listened to the chief, and you could hear him lamenting four times, I think he said that they're strapped so thin. And let's keep in mind, Minneapolis is a city that defunded their police. That's not the chief's fault. That's the failed Democrat leader's fault. But at the same time, when they defund the police, that leaves the chief stretched thin. And so he- was made a decision not to assist ICE-- .",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- He was talking- he was talking to- dealing with the federal issues. Because when you look at the Minnesota database, shooting victims down 76%, homicides down 67%, burglary down 39% year-to-date, sex offenses down, robberies down, motor vehicle theft is up. So he was talking about the response- the deal that they have now, that the stretch they have now dealing with the federal agents who are there.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, but remember, these agents have also arrested thousands of violent criminals in Minneapolis. That's one of the reasons that crime is down, and we're seeing that across the country. ICE- look again, anytime something bad happens, we all lament that. I wish it didn't happen. But the rhetoric does need to be toned down, but we also need to remember, why is ICE doing this in cities? They're enforcing federal law, Margaret. The law says you can't be here illegally and if you're committing violent crimes. The President made it clear, in fact, he was elected. President Trump was elected to get rid of criminals in our communities. 416,000 criminals have been arrested by ICE just in the last year. That has helped make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting you bring up the politics of this, because undoubtedly, the President was elected on the platform of immigration enforcement. There was a lot of support for it. But our latest poll shows more than half of Americans say ICE is making communities less safe, almost two thirds of Americans say they dislike the President's approach to his deportation program. There is not public support for the way this policy is being implemented. Do you think there needs to be a reassessment?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, if you asked people in a poll, do you want violent criminals that are here illegally in your community? Yes or no? What do you think the answer is going to be? I will tell you, overwhelmingly, they will say, please get the violent criminals out. In fact, you're seeing that on the ground in many, many cities where they are cooperating with ICE, where they don't have sanctuary city policies, and where you don't see by the way, people going in the streets breaking the law to interfere with law enforcement, which is a felony.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been a supporter of the Second Amendment. When Secretary Noem says, \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammo rather than a sign.\" Do you believe Americans have the right to bear arms while they're protesting?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, first of all, I'm a co-sponsor of Louisiana's law that allows you to have a concealed carry permit. It's worked very well there. I don't know the state law in Minnesota. I know in a state like Louisiana, and frankly, most states, you are not allowed to carry a gun while you're committing another crime and interfering with law enforcement is a felony. It's something that, unfortunately, we're seeing in a lot of cities. You even had the police chief yesterday, Chief O'Hara, that you just had on, yesterday said of the protests going on after the shooting, that they were unlawful. Yes, he actually said it was an unlawful assembly, what a lot of people are doing. And they were throwing things at ICE agents. Throwing projectiles that could harm ICE agents--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah, he wasn't talking about the victim --",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- So, let's tone this down. And-and leaders in Minnesota, by the way, have been ratcheting up the rhetoric. I mean, you saw the governor, Governor Walz said they're Gestapo. He said they're violently hurting people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to have to take this commercial break and let you finish the thought on the other side of it. If you could stay with us, Leader, we have more questions. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Leader, we have seen a letter that Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Walz out in Minnesota, offering to end the federal surge if the state does a number of things, among them giving access to the food assistance programs and voter registration logs. What's the purpose of that? What's the intent?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't read that letter between Pam Bondi and the governor, but I know that we are investigating tens of billions of dollars of potential fraud coming out of Minnesota. There have been hearings that have already been held. We have a lot of whistle blowers talking to us about major theft of taxpayer money coming out of Minnesota, and these are stealing programs from learning centers, from disabled students, programs that are being stolen, and the Governor did nothing about it. Congress is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- But voter registration logs?--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- Investigating that aggressively.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As a conservative, doesn't that make you a little uncomfortable that they're demanding the state hand- hand over voter registration logs like, what's the purpose of that to end ICE enforcement?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, I haven't seen the letter. I know- I know we're trying in Congress to deal with putting laws on the books that will make sure that we protect the integrity of the vote nationwide. States like Minnesota have had problems with voter integrity. We want a national standard, the SAVE Act, which makes sure illegals can't vote, but also making sure you show a picture ID. Those are things we're pushing for that's across the board federally.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Non-citizens cannot vote. But I want to ask you ICE- about all the things that have happened this week, even before that shooting in Minnesota. ICE has said his officers can go into homes without judicial warrants. ICE shot unarmed Renee Good, as you know, claimed that she was a domestic terrorist. An FBI agent resigned after she was ordered not to investigate the officer who shot her. ICE detained at least five kids, including five-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into custody by men in masks. Does this picture sound right to you? Are you comfortable with how this is being implemented?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Let's keep in mind that the five year old's father was here illegally and was evading law enforcement and abandoned his child. ICE actually--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --the family--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --protected the child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The family disputes that. The administration has a problem with the previous administration's legal system for asylum, that's- they don't like the app he used to file for asylum.",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Well, Joe- Joe Biden allowed--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And they dispute that he fled--.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --millions of people to come into our country illegally, including very violent people, Margaret--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But they are retroactively trying to change the legality of the status--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --people from prisons in other countries. President Trump was elected. The number one issue last year was President Trump saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Absolutely--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: -- I'm going to secure the border, and he's doing it. But also he's removing violent people. 416,000--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The father did not have a criminal record of any kind of violence--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --criminals- illegals have been arrested by ICE. 416,000 have been arrested by ICE. These are very bad people, by the way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 47% of ICE detainees have criminal charges or convictions. 47%.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --ICE just put up a website. Not ICE, Homeland Security, worst of the worst DHS. Go Google worst of the worst DHS. State by state, they show you all the people that have been picked up in each state. Your state, you can find out horrible people, murderers, rapists, that they picked up that would be on the street--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --That doesn't apply to the father or five-year-old Liam--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --today if President Trump wasn't securing this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --or the two year old who was separated from her mother.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --that father was here illegally and abandoned his child--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They are not the worst of the worst, are they?",
      "LEADER SCALISE:\u00a0 --Go look at the website. It shows you who they picked up--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Are they the worst of the worst, sir?",
      "LEADER SCALISE: 416,000 people with violent criminal records. These are people- and by the way, America today has the lowest murder rate that we've had since 1900 in part because of President Trump's actions to get these violent people off our streets. 416,000 have been removed. Do you want them still out on our streets?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: I don't think most people do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No and I don't think--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --This is a hard job ICE has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They do, indeed--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: And local law enforcement, local officials, the mayor, the governor, should not be encouraging people to go out on the streets and break the law by interfering with law enforcement. That's a felony to interfere with law enforcement--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And American citizens are concerned about American citizens being shot, and that's why we are asking the questions--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: Yeah, and we don't have that chaos in other cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -about the tax payer funded federal--",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --Minneapolis has its own problems--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "LEADER SCALISE: --failed leadership that has led to a lot of this, and it's unfortunate it happened. I wish it didn't happen. Their failed leaders need to look in the mirror and tone it down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to go next to our next guest. Leader Scalise, thank you for your time today.",

    "title": "The Righteous: Rescuing Marc Chagall from the Nazis",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rescuing-marc-chagall-from-the-nazis/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:17:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Those who risked their own lives to save Jews during the Holocaust have been called the Righteous Among the Nations. One such rescuer, an American, was Varian Fry, who helped organize artist Marc Chagall's escape from France, for both him and his paintings.",
    "story": [
      "Marc Chagall once commented if he wasn't Jewish, he might not have been an artist. His faith profoundly influenced his works like \"The Praying Jew,\" for example, as well as a never-before-seen work that Chagall gave to his granddaughter, Bella Meyer.",
      "\"He tells the story of Shabbat, from back of his memories,\" Meyer said of the drawing.",
      "She recalled watching her grandfather work: \"I watched him paint, and I loved it. I adored him.\"",
      "But her grandfather's faith also got him in trouble. In Russia where he was born, Chagall was jailed for not having his Jewish residency papers. He later moved to Paris. \"France, for him, meant freedom,\" said Meyer \u2013 freedom, that is, until the Nazis marched into Paris in 1940.",
      "\"For him he was French, rather than Jew,\" Meyer said.",
      "The Nazis didn't see it that way. They considered Chagall's work \"degenerate art.\" In 1941, the Vichy police tracked him down in Marseilles in the south of France and detained him yet again. Had it not been for the courage of strangers \u2013 non-Jews mostly, who risked their own lives to help smuggle him and his paintings to safety \u2013 that might have been the last we ever heard about Marc Chagall.",
      "Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, has a name for such rescuers: The Righteous Among the Nations. There weren't that many righteous rescuers, however; it's easier to discount horror with blind eyes than it is with eyes wide open. Compared to six million murdered Jews, there are fewer than 30,000 non-Jews who have been recognized for helping.",
      "Using taped and transcribed interviews from the U.S. Holocaust Museum, filmmaker Nick Davis brought 45 extraordinary stories of those non-Jews who did help to life.",
      "\"One of them said, you know, he didn't care whether they were Jewish or Catholic or Eskimos; they were persecuted people, and you had to help,\" Davis said.",
      "His film is called \"This Ordinary Thing.\"",
      "\"We have paid enough attention to the bad guys \u2013 Hitler, Himmler, G\u00f6ring \u2013 and we don't think as much about the good people who helped.\" \u2013 Tina Strobos, The Netherlands",
      "\"On a sort of superficial level, I felt like, 'Ugh, haven't we seen enough Holocaust films?'\" Davis said. \"But when I looked at the stories that we were going to be telling, real goodness is what you do when no one's looking.\"",
      "Oscar-winner Hellen Mirren voices the sacrifices of Irene Gut Opdyke, of Poland, who was forced to become the mistress of an elderly SS officer to buy his silence after he discovered that she was hiding Jews in his villa.",
      "\"I won't tell you it was easy. Not only because he was an old man, but I knew there were 12 lives depending on me \u2026 I never talked about what I did during the war. And I still wouldn't, had I not read that article in the newspaper that said the Holocaust didn't happen.\" \u2013 Irene Gut Opdyke",
      "Alex and Mela Roslan sheltered three Jewish brothers in Warsaw. They couldn't call a doctor if things were bad for fear of being discovered. What happened with them, and far too many others, is dramatized by Jeremy Irons:",
      "\"He says, 'I would feel better if you held me.' I picked him up, and he died in my arms. We buried him in the basement sitting up, because someone told me that was the way to bury a Jew. \" \u2013 Alex Roslan, Poland",
      "Dwork believes whatever the motivation of rescuers was, in the case of the Holocaust, the end often justified the means.",
      "I asked, \"So, there really isn't necessarily a line that connects them all, other than the fact that they must've had good souls?\"",
      "\"Sometimes they didn't even have good souls!\" said Dwork. \"Sometimes greed motivated them. And I say three cheers for greed, because it was thanks to the greed that they put their lives at risk, or put themselves in harm's way.\"",
      "Her latest book, \"Saints and Liars: The Story of Americans Who Saved Refugees from the Nazis\" (W.W. Norton), is about American relief workers who helped save Jewish refugees. Most of the Americans you've likely never heard of. \"Think about it: The best known of the Americans is Varian Fry, and very few people know about him,\" she said.",
      "Varian Fry brings us full circle, for he was the man who helped organize Marc Chagall's escape from France. He was the first American to be given the title of The Righteous Among the Nations. His son, James, accepted the honor on his dad's behalf.",
      "Asked why he thinks his father wasn't recognized more, James Fry replied, \"I think the country wanted to move on, and focus on rebuilding, getting life back to normal. People didn't want to remember, I guess.\"",
      "Varian Fry rarely talked about his time during the war, although Chagall paintings sometimes mysteriously appeared in the Fry household, presumably as a thank-you.",
      "In retrospect, James says his dad suffered from outsized bouts of righteous indignation, to the point he believes his dad's bravery may have sprung in part from his being bi-polar. \"I think he harnessed sort of his manic energy to do something that most people would've thought not worth trying,\" he said.",
      "And it's that \u2013 the not worth trying part \u2013 that haunts any discussion of these Righteous Among the Nations. What would you do?",
      "Nick Davis said, \"I have a wife and two amazing daughters, and I don't know that I would risk their lives for a perfect stranger. Let me correct that: I know I wouldn't risk their lives for a perfect stranger.\"",
      "Bella Meyer said, \"I wish I would have the courage to do even a little ounce of it.\"",
      "We'll never know how many there were \u2013 those hiding Jews in attics or basements or crawlspaces rarely survived their generosity. But those who did, did more than save a life; they created opportunities for life, and art, and beauty for years to come.",
      "Asked what she would say to Varian Fry if she could have a conversation with him now, Chagall's granddaughter replied, \"I would just hug him, and thank him for existing.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kirsten Hillman, the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "This interview was recorded on Friday, Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So a lot is going on in the relationship between our two countries. We are so deeply integrated here on trade, you buy more from the U.S. than any other country. We have the world's longest land border. We have shared defense interests through NATO, shared air defense with NORAD. Are we like in the middle of a divorce? Like, how do you describe the relationship?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- I- we're not in the middle of a divorce, but we are in the middle of a change. There's no question about it. I think that we are finding ourselves, quite frankly, in- in a situation where some of the foundations that have governed our relationship for a long time, that you know, integrated supply chains are good, that working together on strategic issues is- are important, that looking out for each other in important ways is- is a number one priority. I think in some quarters, Canadians feel that those foundations are being tested. We will adapt. We will make it through, I have no doubt about that, but it's yeah, it's a complicated time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, you know, Canada had agreed to join this Board of Peace that President Trump announced out at Davos, and then overnight Thursday, the president disinvited Canada. Is this kind of public snub interfering in the relationship, and- and what does that indicate to you about what this Board of Peace is that Canada had said it did want to be a part of?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "So we had expressed an interest in the Board of Peace a number of weeks ago, and essentially, a Board of Peace that is seeking to find peace, in particular, in Gaza and stability, is something that Canada was very much supportive of. The- the parameters of that Board of Peace had just really started to come out and- and our government was considering it, but hadn't- hadn't really made a decision. But I think that- that honestly, I think that the most important thing to say here, from the perspective of Canada, is that we have always and will always be promoting peace and stability and human rights around the world. We'll do it with our allies in various fora, at NATO, at the U.N. bilaterally with like minded countries. So we're not going to change that and- and we will give it our all in- in any fora that- that is available to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It- It's kind of now described as an alternative to the United Nations. Is that something you're comfortable with?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, we are deep supporters of the United Nations. We feel that it's, you know, it's not perfect, no large institution is, but having a place where the whole world can get together and express their views on issues that are important to the globe is vital. And as I say, NATO is vital, and we work with our EU counterparts and EU-Canada, you know, security discussions and in- in various other configurations. So probably all of these different fora are- are essential. The Board of Peace has yet to be fully, I think, understood, and we'll see- we'll- we'll see where that goes, but the outcomes are what matter to Canada.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So your prime minister gave a national address on Thursday, and I understand he denounced authoritarianism and exclusion. He did not mention President Trump by name, but he did rebuke the claim that Trump made at Davos, that Canada lives because of the United States. You're talking about what people receive at home, everyone has local politics, so when something like that is said, do you fear that this is starting not just a spat, but this is like a generational split between our two countries, like, how are people receiving this at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, I think Canadians- Canadians know that Canada lives because of Canadians, because what Canadians do for Canada, and right now, that's where we're trying to focus our attention. By doing what- you know, focusing our attention on what we can control as a nation for ourselves and our own economy and our own security and our own relationships around the world. The United States is always going to be a vital partner. Geography, as you said in your opener, 5,500 miles of border, deep ties, millions of Canadians and Americans that work together every day, that- that you know, do research and study and have families across the border so that- that is there, and that is something that I actually think brings strength to the relationship at times where, you know, in other- at other levels, and maybe at the political level, it- it's more complicated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "It's very complicated. I mean, it- it's almost unthinkable that a phrase like authoritarianism and exclusion that that could be thought to be referring to the leader of the president of the United States?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, I think that there are concerns globally for- by our government, that we have institutions and norms, rules that have governed our countries, yours, mine, and all like minded countries for generations that are really being tested, really being tested. And- and I think what matters is how we react in the face of these tests, and for us, for our country, for our prime minister, you know, there are important implications for our country. And he's- he's trying to articulate a vision. And I think he is articulating a very strong vision for how we must adapt. And again, it's- it's about being pragmatic and principled, and that's- that's what we're going to continue to be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "You have had a long career here in the United States, deeply involved with trade in particular. You helped to negotiate that free trade deal known as USMCA during the first Trump administration. President Trump was asked about it, January 13. He said, I really don't care in terms of renewing it, there's no real advantage. We don't need Canada products here. Is that free trade deal doomed?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "No, it is not doomed. That is my view. All three countries, Canada, the U.S. and Mexico did broad consultations, national consultations, with their business communities in particular, on what- how that agreement works for them. And really without exception, the American comments back were sure we'd like to maybe update this or change this a little bit, but job number one is to do no harm to this agreement, which is the economic foundation of our continental partnership and leads to very important U.S. competitiveness, and Canadian and Mexican competitiveness vis-a-vis other parts of this world. So I think there's- I think that we have to believe that our political leaders are going to be listening to the people in the constituencies for whom that instrument was drawn up, and they're saying, this is vital to us, do no harm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "So do you think there's a bilateral trade deal here? Is that what the Trump administration is going for, rather than the three way deal or--",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "I- you know, I think- I- I- we hear- we hear that sometimes, we hear different things. It is important to remember that even within that agreement, there are a lot of bilateral elements, but there is- there are advantages to doing things trilaterally. There's a lot of supply chain movement that happens between our three countries. And if you, if you break it into two, you could have different rules and disconnects there that are inefficient for business. So we're driven- look, Canada will be driven by what the best thing to do is, as I say, for the companies and constituencies that are relying on that agreement to create jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Because you heard the commerce secretary say at Davos, you know, globalism isn't working. I mean, these free trade deals are part of that globalism. And it was just a week ago, your prime minister was in Beijing, and he described Canada's relationship with China as more predictable than its relationship with the United States. He really meant more predictable than the Trump administration's United States.",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Look, there's no question that the last number of months have been unpredictable for us in our relationship with the United States. You know, we have a trade agreement that had us virtually tariff free between our two countries, and now we have very serious tariffs on steel, aluminum, autos, lumber, and that's causing a lot of challenges within our country. There are people that are losing their jobs. There are industries that are being reoriented, and it's very difficult. So that is seen as, yes, unpredictable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But fortress North America had been an idea. I mean, the treasury secretary talked about it, that the United States, Mexico, Canada, we could stand up together, you know, have shared values, and stand up to China. That seems dead, if Canada is really describing a new alliance here with Beijing.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well, I think- I think we have to put this in perspective. The- the agreement that we did with China a few weeks ago was a very focused and surgical agreement that was largely, or almost exclusively, designed to de-escalate some tariff escalation that had happened over the past year and a bit. So over the past year and a bit, China had put very punitive tariffs on Canadian agricultural products and fish and seafood, shutting Canadians out from one of their primary markets, if not for some of them, their primary market. And so we went to Beijing to re-establish market access for our farmers and our fishers. It's exactly what the U.S. administration did in October when they re-established market access for U.S. soy farmers, and in exchange, rolled back some tariffs and fees. So this is a very pragmatic, very focused approach. I think it's important to put it in context.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But even Ontario's premier said this is letting Chinese \"spy cars\" into your country. I think he means electric vehicles that will be cheaply made in China. Are you worried about becoming too beholden to China and its cheap manufacturing?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, we're not, because, we- the- the auto side of this agreement was again to take us back to 2023, we had the importation of vehicles made in China. Many of those were Teslas, as a matter of fact, and we've gone back and stuck to the level of 2023 for those imports. So this isn't a revolutionary new thing. This is really just trying to roll back or de-escalate what had been escalated over the past year and a bit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Well, the treasury secretary is saying that Albertans are going to have a referendum on succeeding from Canada. He seems to be urging that. What do you make of this--",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and comments like that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: I think it's important to let Albertans and Canadians manage their own very delicate domestic, you know, politics themselves. I think that that's probably wise counsel. Having grown up in Alberta, you know, it's a- it's a- it's a province that has lots of strong views about the way in which it interacts with the rest of the country, as do other parts of our nation. And those are important debates to be had, but they're debates for our country to have within its own citizenry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It seems to be stirring the pot there a bit, but I want to ask you what your prime minister said at Davos. He got a standing ovation for this speech. He described a ruptured global order, the end of a nice story, and the beginning of a new brutal reality, which he described as a predatory one. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "MARK CARNEY, PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA: Stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is: a system of intensifying great power rivalry, where the most powerful pursue their interests using economic integration as coercion.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, if you're not at the table, then you're on the menu. What does this new world order look like?",
      "AMB HILLMAN",
      "Well, that's a good question. I mean, I think he laid out in his- his discussion, his speech, his- his view of what is happening in our world. And it's- it's a world in which rules that governed every player in the globe, every country were maybe not perfectly abided by, as he said, maybe not always exactly exercised as one would hope, but still were sufficient to form the basis of the prosperity, the stability, the predictability that we all used to maximize peace and stability and- and maximize economic reality. So we're moving away our economic benefits, and we're moving away from that, and we have to- countries like ours, have to figure out what that means for us. I think that what it does mean for us is that we can't walk away from our principles. We can't walk away from our belief in rules that are to be abided by by everyone if they commit to them. But at the same time, we have to be pragmatic and we have to look inward to control what we can within our own economies to be as resilient as we possibly can within our own economies, and part of that means engaging pragmatically with a broad array of countries around the world, in trade agreements, in investment relationships and in partnerships.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sounds like Canada is picking off our friends.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I- no, I think Canada is trying to make sure that it is the most resilient it can be for our own benefit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told that President Trump posted on social media just a few moments ago that Canada is against the Golden Dome over Greenland and has voted against it to choose to be closer to China. That's how it was described to me. Yet President Trump had previously talked about Canada participating in this Golden Dome project, which isn't yet built, but it's supposed to be missile- layered missile defense, as I understand it. Do you know what he's talking about, that Canada has rejected being involved?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: No, I'm afraid I don't, but what I can say about the Golden Dome is this, Canada is- is investing over $80 billion over the next five years in our defens-, in our defense systems, and a big part of that is Arctic defense. And a big part of our Arctic defense investments are something called over-the-horizon radar, which is a system that allows us to see the threats that are coming into the Arctic before they arrive. So that is part- and when we have talked to the president about protecting our hemisphere, we have talked about ways in which our different capabilities can work together so that we have eyes on the region and we cooperate in a way that protects both of our countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has described that as Canada wanting to plug in to the system. As you understand it, that's the better description, your own system that would coordinate?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Right. Much as we do across all sorts of defense systems, where we're interoperable. We- we work together. We make our investments that make sense for Canada and defending our territory and defending our sovereignty, but we work with the Americans and- and other allies to maximize the benefits of those.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in- in short, you do think there needs to be more focus on Arctic defense, but you're on board to help do that?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: We're deeply committed to Arctic defense. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I need to ask you about NATO, because you're also a partner at NATO. The only time that NATO's Article 5 was ever invoked, and you know this, was after the 9/11 attacks on this country. That collective defense clause, an attack on one is an attack on all, meant that Europe and Canada, they sent troops right alongside American troops on the battlefield in Afghanistan. Here's what President Trump said.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did. They stayed a little back, little off the front lines.",
      "[SOUNDS ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "He was speaking about all NATO troops. But we did check and about 40,000 Canadians deployed to Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014. 158 were killed, 635 wounded in action. What is a remark like that do to people at home?",
      "AMB HILLMAN: You know, I think what's most important is that we know what our Canadians have done, and I know that your American armed forces are deeply respectful and deeply appreciative of having stood side by side with Canadians in those very, very treacherous and difficult fights. We know that to be true. They know that to be true, and that's what matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time as it wraps up here in Washington.",
      "AMB HILLMAN: Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Great to have you. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 25, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by the city's police chief, Brian O'Hara. Chief, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS POLICE CHIEF, BRIAN O'HARA: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you been able to learn about the shooting? Because we did just hear the claims by Secretary Noem and Mr. Bovino and their version of what happened. Do the videos and evidence back up their descriptions?",
      "O'HARA: So, unfortunately, we don't have any official information from federal law enforcement about what has happened. Even when our officers initially responded to the scene, our watch commander was not given even the most basic information that is typical in a, in a law enforcement involved shooting, just to ensure that there is potentially no other victims. Since then, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension responded to the scene at my request. They were blocked from the scene yesterday, but they have since returned to the scene and are, are now canvassing for additional witnesses and evidence that may be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do I understand you saying that Minnesota has just begun its investigation today?",
      "O'HARA: There were attempts yesterday to begin the investigation. I do not know what, if anything, was conducted yesterday. I do know that while they were at the scene, more than once, they were not permitted to enter before the scene then was contaminated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And for our viewers, Minnesota is a little bit different. There is",
      "this Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that is the state agency that investigates use of force incidents--",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --They are separate from your police force.",
      "O'HARA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But from what you have seen in the public space and heard from federal officials, is there any evidence that you know of that Pretti was assaulting the federal officers, as the Border Patrol chief claims?",
      "O'HARA: Well, I have seen the videos, just as thousands of people around the country have, and the videos speak for themselves. I think it's deeply concerning the things that are being said. This is an individual that was a city resident. It appears that he was present, exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city. So I think very obviously, there are serious questions that are being raised. And I think the greater issue is, even if there is an investigation that ultimately proves that at the time of the shooting it was legally justified, I don't think that even matters at this point, because there just- there is so much outrage and concern around what is happening in the city.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean it does not matter at this point? You mean the situation on the ground is already- the impression is left?",
      "O'HARA: People have had enough. This is the third shooting now in less than three weeks. The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year last year recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn't shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that has been killed. It's the third shooting within three weeks. People have been speaking out, saying that this was going to happen again. And I think everyone is kind of waiting for folks on both sides to come together and just figure this thing out. This is not sustainable. This police department has only 600 police officers. We are stretched incredibly thin. This is taking an enormous toll trying to manage all of this chaos, on top of having to be the police department for a major city. It's too much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you calling on ICE to leave?",
      "O'HARA: We understand that for as long as there has been ICE, there has been immigration enforcement in Minnesota. The problem is not that enforcement is happening. It's clearly the manner in which these things are happening. These tactics are very obviously not safe, and it is generating a lot of outrage and fear in the community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what we know, because DHS claims that Pretti had a weapon on him. You said that Pretti- you implied Pretti was carrying at the time of the incident, when you said he was a legal firearm owner with a license to carry. Do you know if the weapon remained concealed or was it ever brandished?",
      "O'HARA: I have seen different experts and people analyzing the video that have made statements about that. I cannot speculate, but I do not have any, any evidence that I've seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we checked the Minnesota gun permit rules allow for concealed carry, and there are no restrictions on carrying in a protest.",
      "O'HARA: Yes, that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the homeland security secretary said that he had two cartridges on him in addition to the gun. \"I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\" The FBI director said, \"You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.\" Are they on firm legal ground in Minnesota?",
      "O'HARA: You have a Second Amendment right in the United States to possess a firearm, and there are some restrictions around that in Minnesota. And everything that we see, that we are aware of, shows that he did not violate any of those restrictions. He is not a convicted felon, and he is someone that did have a permit for the handgun to carry it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So did he have magazines full of ammunition at the scene? Because both the president of the United States and the border security chief said that he did, and Bovino directly accused you of not saying that publicly. He said the police chief omitted the fact that the suspect had a gun and magazines full of ammunition.",
      "O'HARA: Well, that- what they are omitting is that they are not sharing any information with us, and that they blocked state law enforcement, which is the agency that conducts the overwhelming majority of police involved shootings from the scene. So I don't know how I'm supposed to share information with the public that they are not sharing with us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have not seen evidence that there were multiple magazines, but- but would it even be illegal if that were the case?",
      "O'HARA: I don't think there is any relevance if someone is lawfully exercising their Second Amendment right to carry. The only question would be if they were using the weapon in a- for an unlawful purpose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the things that the vice president also has said about local authorities. The vice president said that local police have been told to stand down when immigration authorities call 911 asking for help dealing with crowds surrounding them. Were you ever ordered to stand down? Have police been told not to protect ICE?",
      "O'HARA: It is deeply disappointing to have anyone question and disparage the hard work of the men and women of the Minneapolis Police Department. There are 600 police officers that are left here after the destruction of the city in 2020, and they are doing an incredible job. About a dozen of our cops have been injured responding to a lot of the chaos that has resulted on the streets. Our officers respond every time there's a threat to someone's life, to public safety or destruction in the city. And it doesn't matter whether it's because ICE is there or someone from the community is there. We are doing everything that we can to manage this chaos. But there's only 600 cops here, and there's thousands of immigration agents here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, nearly 3000 as we understand it. The vice president and Secretary Noem said Minneapolis is uniquely chaotic. But they also pointed to sanctuary city policies and said that if those policies weren't in place, these are policies that prohibit you from assisting federal immigration operations, that none of this would really be happening. How do you respond to that claim that because of the sanctuary city policies, you are being forced into this position?",
      "O'HARA: Well, there's policies and laws that have been the case here for decades, and it's not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement, you know, to hand folks over that are in jails. The city police do not operate a jail that's at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years. And I don't know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now you have the National Guard, I understand, assisting you. Is this sustainable now that you have the guard supporting you? Do you have any idea of how long these protests will last?",
      "O'HARA: Yeah. I mean, yesterday, we had to do an emergency recall. We asked for mutual aid from the state, county and all of local law enforcement around the metro. It was very clearly an emergency, and we requested the National Guard. As of this morning, we have released all of mutual aid, as well as the National Guard partners, and it's back to just the Minneapolis Police responding to calls and trying to protect the city. But this is absolutely not sustainable. Our cops are tired. They are thin stretched as it is, and we have a job to do, trying to keep the people of this city safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So before this shooting, CBS reported that there were at least 10 people from the Minneapolis U.S. Attorney's Office who had resigned. We know the FBI agent resigned after being told to stop investigating the officer who shot Renee Good. What is local law enforcement experiencing beyond your officers, but in the U.S. Attorney's Office, in your local FBI?",
      "O'HARA: I mean the sad part of this is the incredible work that we have done with all of federal law enforcement over the last few years to get real criminals put away, gang members, people that are shooting folks out here, bringing, smuggling fentanyl into this city. We've worked with all of these federal law enforcement agents that live in Minnesota, and it's so- it's so upsetting to see so many of them disparaged and so many of them walking away because it is destroying the foundation of addressing violent crime in Minnesota that's produced incredible results over the last few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Police Chief O'Hara, we wish you well and peace for your city. Thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. And I understand that in your state, ICE just launched this operation \"Catch of the Day,\" which an official told CBS would target Somali immigrants, among others, targeting 1400 criminal aliens who have quote, unquote, terrorized communities in Maine. What's been the impact? Do you know how many arrests there have been?",
      "SEN. KING: There have been something like 100 that DHS has told us- and by the way, to follow up on Leader Scalise's previous comment, that worst of the worst website that DHS has established. They list 13 people in Maine. They concede that- or they state that they've arrested 100. I want to know who the other 83 are- I'm sorry, 87. My math is off. But the point is this worst of the worst thing is a pretext. What they're really doing is going after people who are here. They're asylum seekers. They're in the process. They have green cards. We've had numerous cases in Maine of people being stopped and detained with zero criminal record, including a recruit for the sheriff's office to be a guard at the at the- at the county jail. So this idea that it's the worst of the worst is just nonsense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yesterday, your governor released a statement saying she's requested a meeting with President Trump to withdraw agents from Maine. Powers of the state government seem extremely limited here when you look at Minnesota. Does Maine have any ability to stop this?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, I think we can be talking with DHS and talking with the President. I'm trying to interact with DHS just to get some questions answered. They tell me, I have to submit my questions in writing, and then they'll get back to me in writing maybe in a week or two. I mean, you know, I represent the people of my state. They shouldn't be- I shouldn't have to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape to get some answers. But this- here's the real problem, Margaret, the people that are being terrorized in Maine are being terrorized by ICE. They're not being terrorized by criminals. And ICE says we're taking we're- we're not going to be terrorizing people with criminals on our streets. Here's what's happening in Portland. People are afraid to send their kids to school. People are afraid to go to work. Businesses are suffering because their workers can't come in. Families are sending food to their- to their friends who are afraid to come out. That's the real impact of this, and it far outweighs any benefit that's being accrued by these- by these heavy handed tactics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of getting to a place where, you know, this can be settled peacefully, one of the things the administration argues again and again is, oh, we were forced to do all this because the last administration, you know, didn't do adequate jobs when it- job at the border. But they also point to Sanctuary laws. Maine is about to have a law in place by this summer that will prohibit local law enforcement from working with federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Is there a way forward here between states like Maine and the federal government when it comes to peacefully extracting, peacefully, you know, carrying out interior enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: Well, you put your finger on it. Margaret in the last interview, the question is not, should we enforce the law? Should we be trying to expel dangerous criminals? The question is, how is it done? I did a little research this morning. Obama during his administration, there were something like 2.7 million removals, but you didn't have people roaming the streets with masks on. By the way, I've never seen law enforcement with masks on in my life. Where I come from, the people wearing masks are the bad guys. But you didn't have this heavy handed, heavily armed, you know, bulletproof vest kind of thing. And there were no incidents that I could find of the kind that we've seen just in the last few weeks in Minnesota during that 2.7 million removals during Obama's administration. We've got about 600,000 and and we're having these incidents all over the country, so it's not necessary- you can enforce the laws against illegal immigration and- and people that are criminals without ransacking our cities and terrorizing our residents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is having reverberations in Washington, as you well know. Leader Schumer said Democrats will not vote for the appropriations bill if DHS funding is included. That means we could see a partial shutdown here. Do you know how you're going to vote?",
      "SEN. KING: Margaret, I hate shutdowns. I'm one of the people that helped negotiate the solution to the last- the end of the last shutdown, but I can't vote for a bill that includes ace funding under the circumstances. What they're doing in my state, what we saw yesterday in Minneapolis. There's an easy way out, by the way, Leader Thune could separate, which is what they did in the house, separate the five other appropriation bills, put them on the floor. They would pass, I think, overwhelmingly. Then let's take up DHS. And by the way, if those bills pass, 96% of the federal government is funded. Take up DHS by itself. Let's have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's your path to avoid a shutdown. But quickly, I want to ask you about rhetoric in Arizona, the state AG said ICE is not real law enforcement. Minnesota's governor also said, quit referring to these people as law enforcement, they're not law enforcement. Do you consider ICE law enforcement?",
      "SEN. KING: I guess I technically would, but I don't- again- well, let me, let me put it in the words of the sheriff in- in Cumberland County, Maine when they took one of his recruits, he called it 'bush league policing.' And I think that sort of summarizes it and- and there's no need for this overwhelming show of force. I believe what we're seeing is an attempt to intimidate the American people. Again, armed people with masks and- and telling people they can't photograph what they're doing, and intimidating protesters. That's- that's not America. And then you mentioned in your previous interview about the going into houses without any warrant. That's a blatant violation of the Fourth Amendment. These people are acting outside the Constitution. They're ignoring our laws, and we just can't keep- keep supporting that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator King, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:37:37 -0500",
    "summary": "President's Trump's designs on acquiring the world's largest island \"one way or the other\" have stirred feelings of betrayal among Danes and Greenlanders. Mo Rocca gives us a history lesson about an island that is 80 percent covered in ice.",
    "story": [
      "This past week Greenland was big in the news. Of course, Greenland has always been big. Three times the size of Texas, the world's largest island dominates the arctic space between North America and Europe. Its name notwithstanding, 80 percent of Greenland is covered in ice.",
      "The name Greenland came about as a case of branding, according to Robert Christian Thomsen, a professor of social sciences at Aalborg University in Denmark. Greenland got its name, he says, from Erik the Red, a Viking who came from Iceland and settled there around 985 A.D. Upon returning to Iceland, \"He told the old Norse that lived there, 'There's a magnificent green land to the west of here. You should go, you should come and join us,'\" Thomsen said.",
      "In 1814, Greenland officially became part of the Kingdom of Denmark. So, why all the attention to this mostly desolate landscape?",
      "First, there's security: \"If you look at a map, you'll see that the shortest distance for a missile to travel between Moscow and Washington is immediately over the North Pole and Greenland,\" Thomsen said.",
      "And climate change has made Greenland even more coveted \u2013 more navigable for commercial and military vessels, and easier for mining its rich resources.",
      "\"The receding ice means that there's much more, much better access to oil, to gas, to minerals, including the rare earth elements that are needed for our computers, for our electric cars, for batteries,\" Thomsen said.",
      "American interest in Greenland isn't new. During the 19th century, around the time we bought Alaska from Russia, the U.S. expressed interest in acquiring Greenland. Nothing materialized.",
      "But in 1917 the U.S. did buy territory from Denmark: the three islands in the Caribbean that are today's U.S. Virgin Islands. In return, the United States recognized Danish sovereignty over Greenland.",
      "Then came World War II.",
      "Thomsen said the island was tremendously important to the Allies during the war: \"Denmark is already occupied by the Germans. And so, Greenland is sort of floating out there unprotected. The American administration said, 'We need to occupy Greenland to make sure that the Germans do not do it.'\"",
      "The Allies used the island as a refueling hub for military bombers. After the war, in 1951, the U.S. and Denmark agreed to a more permanent arrangement which, Thomsen said, states that \"The U.S. pretty much has free access [to Greenland]. It can do whatever it wants in terms of establishing military bases, radar, you name it. The U.S. just has to ask politely.\"",
      "But enough about its location and resources. Greenland of course also has people \u2013 a tiny population of about 57,000.",
      "Tillie Martinussen, a native Greenlander and former member of parliament, said growing up in Greenland was wonderful: \"I mean, it's a very, very safe country to grow up in. We're frolicking about in the snow.\"",
      "Martinussen, like almost 90% of the population, is of Inuit descent. Asked what Greenlandic values are, she replied, \"They are we have to take care of each other. We have to stand together. \u00a0Very much community-driven, as opposed to most of the Western countries, which are a lot individually-driven. We live in a society where only two generations ago we're used to people going out hunting to get their food, and we are used to sharing. It's kind of still a state of mind.\"",
      "While polls show most Greenlanders don't want to be American, Martinussen says it's nothing personal: \"I actually love the United States; I love the American people,\" she said. \"Don't get me wrong at all. I mean, one of my dreams was actually going from east to west there in a car.\"",
      "But after President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on Greenland and longtime ally Denmark [\"One way or the other, we're gonna have Greenland\"], that love is being sorely tested.",
      "Martinussen said, \"We have been good allies for 80 years, which makes this treachery feeling so strong in us right now. Children that we have now are going to grow up and being afraid of the United States as the aggressor that we remember.\"",
      "Thomsen said, \"There is a sense, I think, of betrayal. I grew up with \u2013 and most Danes I think grew up with \u2013 the notion that the U.S. is our best friend in the world, you know? So to, all of a sudden, realize that the bad guy, the one who wants to take something away from us and to hurt this state and these people, is not the Russians, is not China, but our best friend.\"",

    "summary": "The Falun Gong dance troupe produces what it describes as a vision of \"China before communism.\" The touring company says it's been targeted by Beijing. Now former performers are suing, alleging forced labor and untreated injuries, allegations Shen Yun disputes.",
    "story": [
      "Deep in the woods of New York State, behind guarded gates, lies a vision of ancient China reborn \u2013 a private sanctuary called Dragon Springs, 400 acres where faith and art share the same stage. It is the creative center of Shen Yun, the epic stage production of Chinese history, legends, and politics.",
      "\"We are putting on stage the tyranny of the CCP,\" said Ying Chen, a vice president and conductor with Shen Yun.",
      "The Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, calls the group behind Shen Yun an evil cult. Known as Falun Gong, it's a spiritual movement rooted in Buddhism. In 1992, founder Li Hongzhi started teaching Falun Gong's meditation exercises, which spread quickly throughout China.",
      "And Beijing responded. In 1999, China banned the religious group, referring to it as \"public enemy number one\" for challenging communist rule.",
      "Ying Chen says practitioners were imprisoned and tortured, including her own family. \"My mom and my brother was sent to a labor camp,\" she said, \"and he endured 18 months of agony, and his survival was a fragile miracle. He was literally tortured every single day.\"",
      "Founder Li Hongzhi settled in the U.S., and in 2006 launched Shen Yun. It would ask much of his followers, including Jeff Sun and Ashley Cheng, who both grew up in Falun Gong families. \"Li Hongzhi made it quite clear that Shen Yun was the highest form of how practitioners can support the movement,\" said Cheng.",
      "Their parents had sent them in the late 2000s to a boarding school at Dragon Springs where young performers train for Shen Yun. We spoke with Sun and Cheng, now married, from their home in New Zealand.",
      "\"The entire community I grew up in was very proud of me,\" Cheng said. \"They thought it was a great honor to live with Li Hongzhi in that compound.",
      "Sun said attending Shen Yun was \"as if, like, I made it to Harvard.\"",
      "He was 15, she was 13 \u2026\u00a0 nearly 9,000 miles from home. According to Cheng, \"Everything was very isolated, and our main job is to dance.\"",
      "Regarding contact with the world outside Dragon Springs, Cheng said that, if their parents asked any questions, \"we had to tell that we were happy, that Master (which is Li Hongzhi) was taking great care of us.\"",
      "The reality, Sun and Cheng claim, was they were part of a group of child laborers living in constant fear.",
      "\"I was in survival mode,\" said Cheng. \"It's about not exceeding 100 pounds every day. It's about following the footsteps of the person in front of me so I don't get yelled out of line.\"",
      "Sun said, \"There's no one we can talk to. The adults there who are your educators, [are] also your persecutors. You want to speak how you feel to them but the next day you get told that you're thinking different to everybody else, that you are the problem.\"",
      "That was the weight of the mind. The body, they say, would bear its own. \"Two kids kind of pushed my legs open in the side split, and it was the most amount of pain I'd ever experienced, ever,\" Sun said. \"I had internal bleeding. My entire inside of my leg, both legs, was purple. But every day I still had to do the same thing.\"",
      "Cheng said, \"My shoulder was stretched for [an] abnormal amount of time once, and I lost all feeling in it. So, I had issues, from showering to going to the bathroom.\"",
      "She said, when telling her instructors about her injuries, \"I was faced with an eye roll. I have not had or seen a single pill of medicine during my entire duration.\"",
      "Sun and Cheng are part of a growing group of former dancers contending that medical care was discouraged, a belief they say is rooted in Falun Gong teachings. \"Any injury that you have, if you mention that you want to go the hospital, or if you wanted help, it will be denied,\" Cheng said. \"And it will be quickly, very quickly associated to, 'You got injured because you disobeyed Li Hongzhi \u2026 It is your fault.'\"",
      "In 2015 they were kicked out of Shen Yun. Last spring they sued, one of two federal lawsuits against the performance group alleging forced labor.",
      "Describing his time with Shen Yun, Sun said, \"Every time I think about what happened to me, it kinda breaks me apart, you know? And nobody deserves this. I mean, we're all kids, you know? We wanted to impress our parents. We wanted to do what we thought was right.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" asked Shen Yun about these allegations \u2013 and they invited us into Dragon Springs, where spokeswoman Ying Chen showed us around.",
      "We observed young men and women in total quiet. \"It's a little bit like praying,\" said Chen. \"We settle down our minds and try to purge distracting thoughts, and just stay really focused.\"",
      "As to why men and women were sitting on opposite sides of the room, Chen said, \"We have very conservative values in the school. So, we usually keep them separate.\"",
      "Asked why Shen Yun invited the media into Dragon Springs \u2013 which they have not done until now \u2013 Chen said, \"I think part of it is because they talk about a compound. Does it look like a compound? I think it's true that we work hard. This is a place that provides top-level dance training, and also it's a faith-based community.\"",
      "Asked to respond to plaintiffs' accusation that they were denied medical attention they may have needed, Chen replied, \"I cannot speak to what they went through. But I just find it very shocking and very different from the practice here and our policies here.\"",
      "Regarding the suggestion that the Chinese government is behind the lawsuits, Chen said, \"These lawsuits emerge at a time when Beijing escalated its global campaign against Shen Yun. It's really hard to see it as a mere coincidence.\"",
      "And just this month, the Chinese Embassy called Shen Yun \"a cult's propaganda,\" using \"culture as cover\" to \"deliver indoctrination.\"",
      "Shen Yun company members Regina Dong, Shindy Cai, and Piotr Huang were also sent as teenagers to Dragon Springs.",
      "Dong said, \"The CCP has been trying to sabotage us since Day One. We've got death threats, bomb threats. And this tactic that they're using now is very similar to what they were using to persecute Falun Gong.\"",
      "Huang said his parents did not pressure him to come to Dragon Springs: \"Not at all. Now, if they came and tried to drag me away, I wouldn't go.\"",
      "He says he has access to medical attention. \"When I was having pain in my Achilles a few years back, my company manager, she gave me the contact to our doctor. I had an MRI done.\" Huang said he got instructions from the doctor on what to do going forward.",
      "Cai, however, said she never gets sick, and believes her faith has protected her: \"I actually do think so, because I almost find it strange sometimes. I'm like, you know, usually I'm supposed to come down with, like, a flu, but never. And I think a lot of it has to do with the energy.\"",
      "For Jeff Sun and Ashley Cheng, they returned to New Zealand, and no longer practice Falun Gong.",
      "Asked to respond to Shen Yun describing them as \"disgruntled performers,\" Cheng replied, \"Yes, we are disgruntled. What happened to us was not our fault. We were children. And we've been living with the shame. And I don't want to live with it for the rest of my life.\"",
      "New York's Department of Labor is now looking into Shen Yun's working conditions and child labor practices, just as the show's 20th season goes on tour.",
      "Each year is a new show, but the final scene is always the same: a Chinese city on the edge of destruction until the deus ex machina \u2013 a mystical being resembling Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi \u2013 descends from the heavens to save the world.",
      "But for now, the story of Shen Yun seems neither so simple, nor perhaps so sacred.",

    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants to fast-track a ban on social media for teenagers under 15.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants his government to fast-track the legal process to ensure that a ban on social media for children under the age of 15 can enter into force in September at the start of the next school year.",
      "In a video released late Saturday by French broadcaster BFM-TV, Macron said he had asked his government to initiate an accelerated procedure so that the proposed legislation can move as quickly as possible and be passed by the Senate in time.",
      "\"The brains of our children and our teenagers are not for sale,\" Macron said. \"The emotions of our children and our teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated. Neither by American platforms, nor by Chinese algorithms.\"",
      "Macron's announcement came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",
      "According to France's health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "Macron's office told The Associated Press that the video was addressed to lawmaker Laure Miller, who is sponsoring the bill that will be examined in a public session on Monday.",
      "\"We are banning social media for under-15s, and we are going to ban mobile phones in our high schools,\" Macron said. \"I believe this is a clear rule. Clear for our teenagers, clear for families, clear for teachers, and we are moving forward.\"",
      "Australia recently implemented the world's first social media ban for teens younger than 16, with its government urging Meta, Snapchat, TikTok, X and Youtube to take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders from their platforms if they don't meet the age requirement. Since then, social media companies have blocked access to about 4.7 million Australian accounts that were identified as belonging to kids under 16, officials said.",
      "The law in Australia provoked fraught debates about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health. It has also prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Peter Malinauskas, the premiere of the state of South Australia, previously told CBS News that officials from North America, Europe and Asia had spoken with him about pushing forward similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is poised to become the second country to institute a social media ban for kids under 16 this year.",

      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "Mikkel Olesen, a Danish foreign policy and diplomacy researcher, told CBS News earlier this month that there aren't Russian and Chinese ships all over the Arctic, but there are Russian planes, and there has historically been a lack of situational awareness in the region.",
      "\"This is something that the U.S. used to do itself. I mean, throughout the Cold War, the U.S. had a line of radar stations across Greenland and the U.S. chose to close down those radar stations because the Cold War ended,\" Olesen said. \"Now, that's not to say that Denmark as an ally isn't obligated to try to help the U.S. handling that problem, not at all. I'm just saying that the status quo before Donald Trump was that the U.S was very happy about being able to just have a free hand in Greenland to handle those issues.\"",

      "\"Put up warning systems, missile systems, soldiers, etc. Just by asking, you can,\" Danish lawmaker Lars Christian Brask, vice-chair of the Danish Parliament's Foreign Policy Committee, told CBS News earlier this month. \"It's not you [the U.S.] running the country, but you have the options, the possibility, of having troops, material ... equipment in Greenland. You just have to ask.\"",
      "Members of the U.S. Congress have openly questioned Mr. Trump's claim of a Russian or Chinese security threat to Greenland, including Senate Intelligence Committee deputy chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, who said, \"The only country that is, frankly, benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",

And there would be many other benefits as well that, again, the president and his national security team are currently talking about.\"",

      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes close to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely of concern to the Trump administration.",
      "Before those two routes started becoming viable during the winter, the only way to move goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia was to go south. But those paths are about 3,000 miles longer, and thus much more expensive.",

      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for them continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "The U.S. \"can explore, of course if you live up to environmental regulations, etc., all the rare earths and minerals that you want in Greenland on a commercial basis. There won't be any hold back on that,\" Danish lawmaker Brask told CBS News earlier this month.",
      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",

    "summary": "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end.",
    "story": [
      "Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, posing a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study says.",
      "Three different penguin species \u2014 the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo \u2014 are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study\u00a0published Tuesday in the Journal of Animal Ecology. The change in habits is setting up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. Between 2012 and 2022, temperatures in the breeding grounds increased by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "\"Penguins are changing the time at which they're breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\" said lead study author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.\"",
      "The researchers said it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Winners and loses in a warming world",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species, at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical for survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. The birds used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species, creating competition. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up her observations, she said.",
      "\"Chinstraps are declining globally,\" Martinez said. \"Models show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it's very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\"",
      "Other factors threaten penguin populations",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \"you have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\" which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",
      "This shift in breeding timing \"is an interesting signal of change and now it's important to continue observing these penguin populations to see if these changes have negative impacts on their populations,\" said Michelle LaRue, a professor of Antarctic marine science at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. She was not part of the Oxford study.",
      "With millions of photos \u2014 taken every hour by 77 cameras for 10 years \u2014 scientists enlisted everyday people to help tag breeding activity using the Penguin Watch website.",
      "\"We've had over 9 million of our images annotated via Penguin Watch,\" Suttle said. \"A lot of that does come down to the fact that people just love penguins so much. They're very cute. They're on all the Christmas cards. People say, 'Oh, they look like little waiters in tuxedos.'\"",
      "Other penguin species in Antarctica are facing trouble. Researchers from the\u00a0British Antarctic Survey\u00a0and University of Southampton said last June that the continent's emperor penguin population may be declining faster than even the most pessimistic predictions. Images showed the species, recognizable by their height and yellow patches, declined in Antarctica by 22% between 2009 and 2024.",

      "As the daughter of Carter Burden, a descendant of the Vanderbilts who built his own broadcasting company, and Amanda Burden, an urban planner who was the daughter of socialite Babe Paley, Belle was independently wealthy when she met Henry Davis, the man she would marry.",

      "Belle Burden and Henry Davis married in 1999, leaving her after an affair in 2020. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "Davis, who Burden refers to in her book as \"James,\" wasn't in a similar position. He was a lawyer at the time, as was Burden, and his family did have money when he was growing up, but, she wrote, \"At some point in the 1970s, his father had a breakdown, was laid off, and stopped working.\"",
      "His parents used savings to cover costs, and when he was in law school, they divorced, and he learned there was no money left. \u00a0Burden said there was one part of the story she never heard fully about his father abandoning the family for a time, \"maybe after an affair,\" before coming back for a number of years before his mother filed for divorce.",
      "While she could never figure out the details, she said the matter of his father and the family's financial struggles stuck with him.",
      "\"He told me how much he wanted to be a husband and father,\" Burden said. \"He told me how much he wanted an honorable life.\"",
      "Three months after their first kiss, he proposed, and, during their engagement, they rented an apartment together and split costs equally. A few months before their 1999 wedding, Burden's mother reminded her she needed to get a prenup written up, something both she and her brother had contractually agreed to in their early 20s.",
      "\"All of my assets were in trust, entirely protected in case of divorce, whether we had a prenup or not. I didn\u2019t think I needed it. But I had committed to having one,\" she wrote.",
      "In the original draft her family lawyer sent, she and James would each keep the assets they brought into the marriage but would split everything earned during the course of the marriage in case of divorce. She recalled James being \"upset\" by the idea, telling her it made him feel \"like an outsider, a threat,\" and she felt guilty for asking him to sign it.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Belle Burden's book was released earlier this month. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "Just weeks before the wedding, the pressure to sign the prenup increased, and James suggested to her that they tweak the agreement so that anything earned during the marriage would not be split if they divorced, but that anything in both of their names would. With him at her side, she called her lawyer, Tom.",
      "\"Tom told me it was a bad idea; it was standard to share in what was earned during a marriage, both by James and by me,\" she wrote. She insisted on doing it James' way, and finally Tom agreed. She never told her family about the change to the standard prenuptial agreement, worried they would \"intervene.\"",
      "In 2001, they bought a four-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, something that was \"much bigger\" than she thought they needed, but that James loved. She emptied one of her two trusts to purchase it and listed James as a joint owner, \"even though he had not contributed to the purchase.\" She said she was happy to do it.",
      "A few years later, she used her second trust to purchase a summer home in Martha's Vineyard. James had gone to look at it alone, and he'd loved it, so she wired him the funds from the trust, emptying it completely, and, as with the apartment, she made sure James was listed as a joint owner of the property.",
      "In 2002, they welcomed their first child, with their second and third coming in 2004 and 2007. Burden wrote that James was excited about each and involved with her pregnancies, but after their second child was born, he was promoted to president at his investment firm and began pulling away from daily parenting duties.",
      "Burden shares three children with her ex-husband. (Belle Burden/Instagram)",
      "\"We had made an unspoken bargain: he would work all the time and I would take care of the kids all the time,\" she explained. \"I resented this sometimes, usually when I was stressed, when one of the kids was sick, or when they were melting down over something. But most of the time, I liked his fervent commitment to his work.\"",
      "As her children got older, she began taking on some pro bono immigration cases but never went back to paid work. She did receive a job offer in 2012, but James dismissed it immediately when she brought it up, telling her she needed to be available for the kids. At first, she recalled being upset that he didn't even discuss it with her, but the feeling passed quickly, believing he was right, that the family \"needed to prioritize James' career.\" She turned down the offer.",
      "Burden said, as the years went by, she and James discussed getting rid of their prenup \"since it was no longer fair\" to her. She'd used her trusts to purchase their homes, and his career had flourished while she gave hers up to raise their children.",
      "In July 2019, they had a meeting scheduled with their lawyer to do just that, but James suggested just before the meeting that they \"table\" the prenup issue and focus on their wills, telling her that he wanted to leave everything to her directly instead of in trusts for their three children.",
      "Less than a year later, she discovered he was having an affair.",

      "It was in 2020, when the family was spending the early days of the COVID-19 lockdown in their Martha's Vineyard home, that she received a voicemail from a man who claimed his wife was having an affair with James. When she confronted James, he admitted everything, and the next morning, he told her he wanted a divorce.",
      "He left the home without saying goodbye to the children. Her son, who was 17 at the time, was staying on Long Island with friends, but their daughters, who were 15 and 12, were sleeping when he left.",

      "She also recalled him telling her, \"You can have the house and the apartment. You can have custody of the kids. I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want any of it.\"",
      "James continued paying the family's bills, and he maintained that he didn't want any official custody of the children, believing they were old enough to decide when they wanted to see him.",

      "It wasn't until January 2021, when, as part of the divorce proceedings, Burden received documents detailing James' earnings over the years, that she realized just how much wealth her soon-to-be ex-husband had accrued over the years. She also realized how their altered prenup, the one she wanted against her lawyer's advice, put her at a disadvantage.",
      "She wrote, \"Now James could claim his ownership stake in both properties. He could walk away with his assets. He could become a partner at a hedge fund, where his wealth would increase exponentially, unencumbered by me.\"",
      "Burden is also the granddaughter of New York socialite Babe Paley. (Getty Images)",
      "Her lawyer began preparing a counterclaim. She knew she didn't have much of a shot with the prenup designed the way it was, but she and her lawyer both felt she had to try. Her stepmother, Susan, warned her that James might get \"angry\" over the counterclaim, and Burden admitted that \"it would be easier, safer\" to let the divorce play out and to trust James \"would be fair to me in the end.\"",
      "Still, she questioned why she should trust him and admitted to feeling \"an almost nihilistic desire to set flame to the remaining structures of my former life, to the very safety I clung to, to the fiction that I could depend on anyone other than myself for protection, to the idea that being quiet was the only way to be good.\"",
      "Six months later, a judge dismissed the counterclaim and enforced the prenup, then set a trial date to resolve the issue of child support and their joint property. James, Burden wrote, hadn't brought up her counterclaim in the months after she initially filed it, but after it was dismissed, he was \"inflamed by it.\"",

      "\"He said he would give me only the minimum child support required by law,\" she claimed. \"He said I would have to face the consequences of the prenup, of my failed counterclaim.\"",
      "Soon after, James' lawyer wrote her a letter, assuming that she'd want to buy James out of his interest in their two homes. She couldn't afford that, so she began coming to terms with the idea that she'd have to sell both. It was then, she recalled, that things became \"very dark.\"",
      "She grappled with the idea of her children losing the homes they'd known all their lives and with losing what her family had left to her, as well as her own financial security.",
      "\"There was no reason for it, given James\u2019s resources, given his desire to shed, given his refusal to make a home for the kids,\" she wrote. \"It felt like he was playing a game, or running a deal, one he was going to win at all costs, by a wide margin, regardless of the impact on me and our children.\"",
      "In the end, an hour before their trial was to begin, Burden and James reached a settlement on their own. He negotiated the terms, and she said that she \"had to be calm, deferential, grateful,\" and that if she got her lawyer involved or \"pushed him,\" he would withdraw the offer altogether.",
      "Burden, with stepmother Susan and her former husband, was able to keep both homes she purchased with her trusts. (Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)",
      "He gave up his interest in the two properties they owned and agreed to child support and to pay the children's medical expenses and school tuition. Meanwhile, he'd keep all the money he'd earned throughout their marriage.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know what finally made him decide to settle,\" Burden admitted. \"I have several guesses, but I will never know for sure. Maybe he always planned to resolve it before trial, to give me the house and the apartment. But only after he brought me to my knees.\"",
      "She said when she signed the agreement, she tried to let everything go and that she's been mostly successful. These days, she doesn't think about the money or the details of the split, but there are some things about the divorce that chill her.",

      "A 2025 Mayo Clinic review found that just 10 minutes of heavy snow shoveling can push the heart to about 97% of its maximum rate. Exposure to cold air was also found to increase blood pressure and reduce coronary blood flow.",
      "While there isn\u2019t an official age that\u2019s \"too old\" to shovel, some cardiologists recommend that individuals over 45 should exercise more caution to lower their chances of a cardiac event.",

      "\"While there's no strict age cutoff, generally above the age of mid 40s and above, we tend to be a little more cautious \u2014 particularly in people who are less active [without] regular exercise,\" Dr. Navjot Kaur Sobti, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Northwell\u2019s Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, previously told Fox News Digital.",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "That study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month, also found that those over age 65 had higher rates of temperature-related deaths.",

      "Safer shoveling tips",
      "The cardiologist said it\u2019s ideal to have someone else help with snow removal \u2014 but if you do choose to use a shovel, she recommends pacing yourself and using a \"pushing or sweeping\" motion instead of heavy lifting.",
      "Recent research has shown that cold exposure accounts for nearly twice as many cardiovascular deaths as heat exposure. (iStock)",
      "To protect against the cold, Sobti also recommends covering your mouth, nose and extremities, wearing a hat and gloves, and using extra caution in windy conditions.",

      "Why malicious Chrome extensions look legitimate",
      "These malicious add-ons are designed to look legitimate. They use professional names, polished dashboards and business-focused descriptions. Some claim to offer faster access to workplace tools. Others say they restrict user actions to protect company accounts. Privacy policies often promise that no personal data is collected. For people juggling daily work tasks or managing business accounts, the pitch sounds helpful rather than suspicious.",
      "What these extensions actually do",
      "After installation, the extensions operate silently in the background. They steal session cookies, which are small pieces of data that tell websites you are already logged in. When attackers get these cookies, they can access accounts without a password. At the same time, some extensions block access to security pages. Users may be unable to change passwords, disable accounts or review login history. One extension even allows criminals to insert stolen login sessions into another browser. That lets them sign in instantly as the victim.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions are so dangerous",
      "This attack goes beyond stealing credentials. It removes the ability to respond. Security teams may detect unusual activity, but cannot fix it through normal controls. Password changes fail.

      "Browser extensions can be useful, but this research shows how easily they can also be abused. These fake Chrome add-ons did not rely on flashy tricks or obvious warnings. They blended in, looked professional and quietly did their damage in the background. The good news is that you do not need to be a tech expert to protect yourself. Taking a few minutes to review your extensions, remove anything unfamiliar and lock down your accounts can make a real difference. Small habits, repeated regularly, go a long way in reducing risk. If there is one takeaway here, it is this: convenience should never come at the cost of security. A clean browser and strong account protections give you back control.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Google designed Fast Pair to make Bluetooth connections fast and effortless. One tap replaces menus, codes and manual pairing. That convenience now comes with serious risk. Security researchers at KU Leuven uncovered flaws in Google's Fast Pair protocol that allows silent device takeovers. They named the attack method WhisperPair. An attacker nearby can connect to headphones, earbuds or speakers without the owner knowing. In some cases, the attacker can also track the user's location. Even more concerning, victims do not need to use Android or own any Google products. iPhone users are also affected.",

      "Fast Pair makes connecting Bluetooth headphones quick, but researchers found that some devices accept new pairings without proper authorization. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What WhisperPair is and how it hijacks Bluetooth devices",
      "Fast Pair works by broadcasting a device's identity to nearby phones and computers. That shortcut speeds up pairing. Researchers found that many devices ignore a key rule. They still accept new pairings while already connected. That opens the door to abuse.",
      "Within Bluetooth range, an attacker can silently pair with a device in about 10 to 15 seconds. Once connected, they can interrupt calls, inject audio or activate microphones. The attack does not require specialized hardware and can be carried out using a standard phone, laptop, or low-cost device like a Raspberry Pi. According to the researchers, the attacker effectively becomes the device owner.",
      "Audio brands affected by the Fast Pair vulnerability",
      "The researchers tested 17 Fast Pair compatible devices from major brands, including Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. Most of these products passed Google certification testing. That detail raises uncomfortable questions about how security checks are performed.",
      "How headphones can become tracking devices",
      "Some affected models create an even bigger privacy issue. Certain Google and Sony devices integrate with Find Hub, which uses nearby devices to estimate location. If a headset has never been linked to a Google account, an attacker can claim it first. That allows continuous tracking of the user's movements. If the victim later receives a tracking alert, it may appear to reference their own device. That makes the warning easy to dismiss as an error.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Attacker's dashboard with location from the Find Hub network. (KU Leuven)",
      "Why many Fast Pair devices may stay vulnerable",
      "There is another problem most users never consider. Headphones and speakers require firmware updates. Those updates usually arrive through brand-specific apps that many people never install. If you never download the app, you never see the update. That means vulnerable devices could remain exposed for months or even years.",
      "The only way to fix this vulnerability is by installing a software update issued by the device manufacturer. While many companies have released patches, updates may not yet be available for every affected model. Users should check directly with the manufacturer to confirm whether a security update exists for their specific device.",
      "Why convenience keeps creating security gaps",
      "Bluetooth itself was not the problem. The flaw lives in the convenience layer built on top of it. Fast Pair prioritized speed over strict ownership enforcement. Researchers argue that pairing should require cryptographic proof of ownership. Without it, convenience features become attack surfaces. Security and ease of use do not have to conflict. But they must be designed together.",
      "Google responds to the Fast Pair WhisperPair security flaws",
      "Google says it has been working with researchers to address the WhisperPair vulnerabilities and began sending recommended patches to headphone manufacturers in early September. Google also confirmed that its own Pixel headphones are now patched.",
      "In a statement to CyberGuy, a Google spokesperson said, \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe. We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"",
      "Google says the core issue stemmed from some accessory makers not fully following the Fast Pair specification. That specification requires accessories to accept pairing requests only when a user has intentionally placed the device into pairing mode. According to Google, failures to enforce that rule contributed to the audio and microphone risks identified by the researchers.",
      "To reduce the risk going forward, Google says it updated its Fast Pair Validator and certification requirements to explicitly test whether devices properly enforce pairing mode checks. Google also says it provided accessory partners with fixes intended to fully resolve all related issues once applied.",
      "On the location tracking side, Google says it rolled out a server-side fix that prevents accessories from being silently enrolled into the Find Hub network if they have never been paired with an Android device. According to the company, this change addresses the Find Hub tracking risk in that specific scenario across all devices, including Google's own accessories.",
      "Researchers, however, have raised questions about how quickly patches reach users and how much visibility Google has into real-world abuse that does not involve Google hardware. They also argue that weaknesses in certification allowed flawed implementations to reach the market at scale, suggesting broader systemic issues.",
      "For now, both Google and the researchers agree on one key point. Users must install manufacturer firmware updates to be protected, and availability may vary by device and brand.",
      "SMART HOME HACKING FEARS: WHAT\u2019S REAL AND WHAT\u2019S HYPE",
      "Unwanted tracking notification showing the victim's own device. (KU Leuven)",
      "How to reduce your risk right now",
      "You cannot disable Fast Pair entirely, but you can lower your exposure.",
      "If you use a Bluetooth accessory that supports Google Fast Pair, including wireless earbuds, headphones or speakers, you may be affected. The researchers created a public lookup tool that lets you search for your specific device model and see whether it is vulnerable. Checking your device is a simple first step before deciding what actions to take. Visit whisperpair.eu/vulnerable-devices to see if your device is on the list.",
      "Install the official app from your headphone or speaker manufacturer. Check for firmware updates and apply them promptly.",
      "Pair new devices in private spaces. Avoid pairing in airports, caf\u00e9s or gyms where strangers are nearby.",
      "Unexpected audio interruptions, strange sounds or dropped connections are warning signs.\u00a0 A factory reset can remove unauthorized pairings, but it does not fix the underlying vulnerability. A firmware update is still required.",
      "Bluetooth only needs to be on during active use. Turning off Bluetooth when not in use limits exposure, but it does not eliminate the underlying risk if the device remains unpatched.",
      "Always factory reset used headphones or speakers before pairing them. This removes hidden links and account associations.",
      "Investigate Find Hub or Apple tracking alerts, even if they appear to reference your own device.",
      "Install operating system updates promptly. Platform patches can block exploit paths even when accessories lag behind.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "WhisperPair shows how small shortcuts can lead to large privacy failures. Headphones feel harmless. Yet, they contain microphones, radios and software that need care and updates. Ignoring them leaves a blind spot that attackers are happy to exploit. Staying secure now means paying attention to the devices you once took for granted.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "AI assistants are supposed to make life easier. Tools like Microsoft Copilot can help you write emails, summarize documents and answer questions using information from your own account. But security researchers are now warning that a single bad link could quietly turn that convenience into a privacy risk.",
      "A newly discovered attack method shows how attackers could hijack a Copilot session and siphon data without you seeing anything suspicious on screen.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "Because Copilot stays tied to your logged-in Microsoft account, attackers can quietly use your active session to access data in the background. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "What researchers discovered about Copilot links",
      "ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS",
      "Security researchers at Varonis uncovered a technique they call \"Reprompt.\" In simple terms, it shows how attackers could sneak instructions into a normal-looking Copilot link and make the AI do things on their behalf.",
      "Here's the part that matters to you: Microsoft Copilot is connected to your Microsoft account. Depending on how you use it, Copilot can see your past conversations, things you've asked it and certain personal data tied to your account. Normally, Copilot has guardrails to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Reprompt showed a way around some of those protections.",
      "The attack starts with just one click. If you open a specially crafted Copilot link sent through email or a message, Copilot can automatically process hidden instructions embedded inside the link. You don't need to install anything, and there are no pop-ups or warnings. After that single click, Copilot can keep responding to instructions in the background using your already logged-in session. Even closing the Copilot tab does not immediately stop the attack, because the session stays active for a while.",
      "How Reprompt works",
      "Varonis found that Copilot accepts questions through a parameter inside its web address. Attackers can hide instructions inside that address and make Copilot execute them as soon as the page loads.",
      "That alone would not be enough, because Copilot tries to block data leaks. The researchers combined several tricks to get around this. First, they injected instructions directly into Copilot through the link itself. This allowed Copilot to read information it normally shouldn't share.",
      "Second, they used a \"try twice\" trick. Copilot applies stricter checks the first time it answers a request. By telling Copilot to repeat the action and double-check itself, the researchers found that those protections could fail on the second attempt.",
      "Third, they showed that Copilot could keep receiving follow-up instructions from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Each response from Copilot helped generate the next request, allowing data to be quietly sent out piece by piece. The result is an invisible back-and-forth where Copilot keeps working for the attacker using your session. From your perspective, nothing looks wrong.",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "Varonis responsibly reported the issue to Microsoft, and the company fixed it in the January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates. There is no evidence that Reprompt was used in real-world attacks before the fix. Still, this research is important because it shows a bigger problem. AI assistants have access, memory and the ability to act on your behalf. That combination makes them powerful, but also risky if protections fail. As researchers put it, the danger increases when autonomy and access come together.",
      "It's also worth noting that this issue only affected Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot, which businesses use, has extra security layers like auditing, data loss prevention and admin controls.",
      "\"We appreciate Varonis Threat Labs for responsibly reporting this issue,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We have rolled out protections that address the scenario described and are implementing additional measures to strengthen safeguards against similar techniques as part of our defense-in-depth approach.\"",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from AI attacks",
      "Even with the fix in place, these habits will help protect your data as AI tools become more common.",
      "Security fixes only protect you if they're installed. Attacks like Reprompt rely on flaws that already have patches available. Turn on automatic updates for Windows, Edge and other browsers so you don't delay critical fixes. Waiting weeks or months leaves a window where attackers can still exploit known weaknesses.",
      "If you wouldn't click a random password reset link, don't click unexpected Copilot links either. Even links that look official can be weaponized. If someone sends you a Copilot link, pause and ask yourself whether you were expecting it. When in doubt, open Copilot manually instead.",
      "Even after Microsoft fixed the flaw, the research highlights why limiting data exposure and monitoring account activity still matters as AI tools evolve. (Photographer: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every service you use. If attackers manage to access session data or steal credentials indirectly, unique passwords prevent one breach from unlocking your entire digital life. Many password managers also warn you if a site looks suspicious or fake.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of protection, even if attackers gain partial access to your session. It forces an extra verification step, usually through an app or device, making it much harder for someone else to act as you inside Copilot or other Microsoft services.",
      "5) Reduce how much personal data exists online",
      "Data broker sites collect and resell personal details like your email address, phone number, home address and even work history. If an AI tool or account session is abused, that publicly available data can make the damage worse. Using a data-removal service helps delete this information from broker databases, shrinking your digital footprint and limiting what attackers can piece together.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. They help detect phishing links, malicious scripts and suspicious behavior tied to browser activity. Since Reprompt-style attacks start with a single click, having real-time protection can stop you before damage happens, especially when attacks look legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check your Microsoft account activity for unfamiliar logins, locations, or actions. Review what services Copilot can access, and revoke anything you no longer need. These checks don't take long, but they can reveal issues early, before attackers have time to do serious damage. Here's how:",
      "Go to account.microsoft.com, and sign in to your Microsoft account.",
      "Select Security, then choose View my sign-in activity and verify your identity if prompted.",
      "Review each login for unfamiliar locations, devices or failed sign-in attempts.",
      "If you see anything suspicious, select This wasn't me or Secure your account, then change your password immediately and enable two-step verification.",
      "Visit account.microsoft.com/devices, and remove any devices you no longer recognize or use.",
      "In Microsoft Edge, open Settings > Appearance > Copilot and Sidebar > Copilot, and turn off Allow Microsoft to access page content if you want to limit Copilot's access.",
      "Review apps connected to your Microsoft account and revoke permissions you no longer need.",
      "A single Copilot link can carry hidden instructions that run the moment you click, without any warning or pop-ups.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Avoid giving AI assistants broad authority like \"handle whatever is needed.\" Wide permissions make it easier for hidden instructions to influence outcomes. Keep requests narrow and task-focused. The less freedom an AI has, the harder it is for malicious prompts to steer it silently.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Reprompt doesn't mean Copilot is unsafe to use, but it does show how much trust these tools require. When an AI assistant can think, remember and act for you, even a single bad click can matter. Keeping your system updated and being selective about what you click remain just as important in the age of AI as it was before.",

      "Why ice storms are especially disruptive",
      "Ice storms cause more damage than most people expect. Unlike snow, ice sticks to everything and adds significant weight. Ice builds up on trees and power lines, causing branches to snap and lines to fall. Utility crews often cannot begin repairs until conditions improve, which delays restoration.

      "What happened in the Gulshan ransomware attack",
      "According to a disclosure filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, Gulshan Management Services, Inc. reported a cybersecurity incident that impacted more than 377,000 individuals. Gulshan is linked to Gulshan Enterprises, which operates around 150 Handi Plus and Handi Stop gas stations and convenience stores across Texas.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",
      "The company says it detected unauthorized access to its IT systems in late September. Investigators later determined that attackers had been inside the network for roughly ten days before anyone noticed. The intrusion began with a phishing attack, a reminder of how a single deceptive email can still open the door to massive breaches.",
      "Ransomware attacks don\u2019t just hit tech companies. Retailers like gas stations store sensitive customer and employee data that criminals actively target. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "During that window, the attackers accessed and stole personal data, then deployed ransomware that encrypted files across Gulshan's systems. The compromised information includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. That combination is especially dangerous, since it can be used for identity theft, account takeovers and fraud that may surface months or even years later.",
      "Why the lack of a ransomware claim still matters",
      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",
      "We reached out to Gulshan Management Services for comment regarding the breach, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "A customer pumps gas at a gas station on Feb. 13, 2025, in Austin, Texas.\u00a0 (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "10 steps you can take to protect yourself after a breach like this",
      "If your information was exposed in this breach or any similar ransomware incident, there are concrete steps you can take to reduce the fallout.",
      "If the company offers free credit monitoring or identity protection, enroll in it. These services can alert you early if someone tries to open accounts or misuse your identity. If nothing is offered, consider signing up for a reputable identity theft protection service on your own.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "The less of your information that's floating around data broker sites, the harder it is for criminals to target you. Data removal services can help reduce your digital footprint over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "After breaches like this, scammers often send fake emails or texts pretending to be the affected company or a credit monitoring service. Slow down, verify messages independently, and never click links you weren't expecting.",
      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "In the Gulshan attack, hackers spent days inside internal systems, stealing personal data before deploying ransomware that locked down files. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

      "Crowded cabins and forced small talk have long defined ride-sharing. A California startup wants to flip that idea on its head.",
      "Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels.",
      "The goal is simple. Get you from point A to point B without invading your personal space.",

      "One-way glass and independent controls keep each rider anonymous, even when the vehicle is shared. (Pliyt)",
      "Pliyt's vehicle is designed from the inside out. Each passenger rides inside a self-contained capsule that prioritizes privacy, comfort and control. The company says the idea resonated strongly when the prototype debuted at CES earlier this month. Here is what sets the concept apart:",

      "You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice.",
      "\"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility,\" the company told CyberGuy. \"As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",
      "Is Pliyt fully autonomous?",
      "Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.",
      "\"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in San Francisco around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature,\" a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. \"Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly.\"",
      "Pliyt\u2019s concept vehicle replaces a shared cabin with four fully enclosed pods designed for personal space and comfort. (Pliyt)",
      "Privacy-first design sets Pliyt apart",
      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.",

      "How Pliyt compares to other autonomous vehicles",
      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",

      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",

      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",

      "Apple and Google have entered a multiyear AI partnership that will shape the future of Apple Intelligence and Siri. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why Apple chose Google's Gemini",
      "Apple evaluated multiple AI options before settling on Gemini. According to the joint statement, Apple believes Google's AI provides the strongest foundation for its own models. Gemini has quickly become one of the most capable large language model families, backed by Google's massive cloud infrastructure.",
      "For Apple, this means faster development, more reliable performance and the ability to roll out advanced features without rebuilding everything from scratch. At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",

      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems. In short, users get better AI without giving up Apple's privacy stance, at least in theory.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Apple's partnership with Google marks a turning point in its AI story. Instead of going it alone, Apple is betting that combining its privacy-focused platform with Google's AI muscle is the fastest path forward. If Apple delivers on its promises, this deal could finally close the AI gap that has frustrated users and investors alike. The real test will come when those features land on your devices.",

      "A new mobile app from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called \"Are You Dead?\" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.",

      "How the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app works",
      "The app's design is intentionally simple. After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.",
      "Here is how it works in practice:",

      "The alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",

The developers describe it as a \"lightweight safety tool\" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on Apple's App Store for iPhone and iPad.",
      "Why the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app went viral in China",
      "The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.",
      "Why users say the app provides peace of mind",
      "For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.",

      "The name of the app sparks debate",
      "Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it \"Are You Alive?\" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for the app if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.",
      "What the developers of the app plan next",
      "The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.",
      "Planned updates include:",
      "Adding direct messaging to emergency contactsMaking the app more friendly for older usersReconsidering the app's name",
      "Adding direct messaging to emergency contacts",
      "Making the app more friendly for older users",
      "Reconsidering the app's name",
      "Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.",
      "Loneliness is not just a problem in China",
      "The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.",

      "According to the bureau, a North Korean government-sponsored hacking group is using a tactic known as quishing to target people in the United States.",
      "The goal is simple. Trick you into scanning a QR code that sends you to a malicious website. From there, attackers can steal login credentials, install malware or quietly collect device data.",

      "The FBI is warning Americans about a growing cyber threat that uses QR codes to steal data and spy on victims, tying the attacks to a North Korean hacking group. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "What quishing is and why it works",
      "Quishing is short for QR code phishing. Instead of clicking a suspicious link in an email, the victim scans a QR code that hides the real destination. QR codes themselves are harmless. The danger lies in the link embedded inside them. Once scanned, the link can redirect users to fake login pages, malware downloads or tracking sites. Because QR codes feel familiar and fast, many people scan them without thinking twice. That split second of trust is exactly what attackers rely on.",
      "Who is behind the attacks",
      "The FBI says the activity is tied to a hacking group known as Kimsuky. The group has operated for years as a cyber espionage arm for North Korea. What is new is the delivery method. According to the FBI, the QR code-based attacks began in May 2025. In one example, attackers posed as a foreign policy advisor and emailed a think tank leader with a QR code that linked to a fake questionnaire. Scanning the code sent the victim to a malicious site designed to harvest information.",
      "What happens after you scan the QR code",
      "Once a victim lands on one of these sites, several things can happen. Some pages prompt users to download files that contain malware. Others mimic mobile login portals for popular services such as Okta, Microsoft 365 or VPN services. Even if no form is filled out, the site can still collect device details. That includes IP address, operating system, browser type and approximate location. Over time, that data helps attackers build intelligence profiles on their targets.",
      "Why QR code phishing attacks are highly targeted",
      "The FBI describes these campaigns as spear phishing rather than mass spam. That means the emails are crafted for specific individuals. The language context and sender details are tailored to look relevant and credible. When an email feels personal, people are more likely to trust it. That is why these attacks are especially dangerous for professionals, researchers, executives and anyone working in policy or technology.",
      "Why QR code phishing threats are growing",
      "QR codes are everywhere now. Restaurants, parking meters, event tickets and ads all rely on them. As their use grows, so does the opportunity for abuse. Attackers know people are conditioned to scan without hesitation. That makes caution more important than ever.",
      "Ways to stay safe from QR code phishing",
      "The FBI says one of the best defenses against quishing is slowing down. QR codes remove the visual clues people rely on, so a few extra checks can make a big difference.",
      "Treat QR codes like links in emails. If you did not expect it, do not scan it. QR codes sent by email, text or messaging apps are a common entry point for quishing attacks. Criminals rely on curiosity and urgency to push you into scanning without thinking.",
      "Always confirm who sent the QR code. If a message claims to come from a coworker, vendor or organization, reach out through a separate channel before scanning. A quick call or direct message can stop a phishing attempt cold.",

      "Federal investigators say hackers are using \"quishing,\" or QR code phishing, to lure victims to malicious websites that steal credentials and device data. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)",
      "QR code phishing often leads to fake mobile login pages. Attackers mimic sign-in screens for email, VPNs and cloud services to steal usernames and passwords. If a QR code takes you to a login page, close it and visit the site manually instead.",
      "Once a QR code opens a page, check the address bar. Look for misspellings, extra words or unfamiliar domain endings. A strange URL is often the only warning sign that the site is malicious.",
      "Strong antivirus software adds an extra layer of protection against quishing. Security tools can block known phishing sites, stop malicious downloads and warn you before harmful pages load. This is especially important on mobile devices, where QR codes are most often scanned.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.",
      "Why breaches like this are especially risky",
      "When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.",
      "Exposed records can be used for identity theft, fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.",
      "As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.",

      "7 steps you can take to stay safe after the Illinois DHS breach",
      "If you received a notification from Illinois DHS, or if you've ever interacted with DHS programs, these steps can help reduce your risk.",
      "If DHS provides free identity monitoring or credit protection, sign up. These services can alert you to suspicious activity involving your Social Security number or credit file before the damage spreads. Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account. If your personal data is leaked, attackers often try the same credentials across multiple services. Unique passwords stop one breach from turning into many.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Strong antivirus tools do more than scan files. They monitor suspicious behavior, phishing attempts and malicious links that often follow large data breaches. This matters because breach victims are frequently targeted with follow-up scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before opening new accounts. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new credit entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is often the safest option.",
      "Once your information leaks, it often spreads to data broker sites that sell personal details. Personal data removal services work to request takedowns and reduce how much of your information is publicly available. While they can't erase everything, they significantly lower your exposure.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "After breaches involving government agencies, scammers often pretend to be state officials, benefits offices, or support hotlines. Don't click links or share information unless you independently verify the source through official websites or phone numbers.",
      "You're entitled to free credit reports from major credit bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, inquiries or address changes. Early detection makes identity theft far easier to contain.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Even government agencies are not immune to large-scale security failures. When nearly 700,000 residents are affected, the impact goes far beyond a single system or department. While DHS works through its investigation, protecting your identity now depends largely on the steps you take next. Acting early, layering protections and staying vigilant can make the difference between a breach being an inconvenience or a long-term nightmare.",

      "The approval comes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and marks a major shift in how mental health conditions may be treated. The newly approved device is called FL-100, and it comes from Flow Neuroscience.",
      "It is designed for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Clinicians can prescribe it as a stand-alone treatment or alongside antidepressants and therapy. This decision matters because depression affects more than 20 million adults in the U.S. Roughly one-third do not get enough relief from medication or stop taking it due to side effects.",

      "SIMPLE DAILY HABIT MAY HELP EASE DEPRESSION MORE THAN MEDICATION, RESEARCHERS SAY",
      "Flow Neuroscience has gotten approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its FL-100 prescription brain-stimulation device. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "How the Flow FL-100 works",
      "The FL-100 uses transcranial direct current stimulation, often shortened to tDCS. This technology delivers a gentle electrical current to the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain tied to mood regulation and stress response. In many people with depression, activity in this area is reduced. By stimulating it, the device aims to restore healthier brain signaling over time. The system looks like a lightweight headset and pairs with a mobile app. Patients use it at home for about 30 minutes per day while clinicians monitor progress remotely.",
      "The clinical results behind the approval",
      "The FDA based its decision on a randomized controlled trial that evaluated home use under remote supervision. Participants who received active stimulation showed meaningful improvement on clinician-rated and self-reported depression scales. After 10 weeks of treatment, patients experienced an average symptom improvement of 58% compared to a control group. Many users reported noticeable changes within the first three weeks. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine, adding credibility to the findings. Side effects were generally mild and short-term. Reported issues included skin irritation, redness, headaches, and brief stinging sensations at the electrode sites.",
      "The FDA has approved the first prescription brain-stimulation device for at-home treatment of depression in the U.S., marking a major shift in mental healthcare. (hoto by ISSAM AHMED/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "A growing shift toward tech-based mental health care",
      "Flow's device has already been used by more than 55,000 people across Europe, the U.K., Switzerland and Hong Kong. In the U.K., it is prescribed within parts of the public health system. Company leaders say the U.S. approval opens the door for broader access to non-drug treatment options. The momentum is not isolated. In 2025, researchers at UCLA Health developed another experimental brain-stimulation approach, signaling rapid growth in this field. Together, these advances suggest that at-home neuromodulation may soon become a standard part of depression care rather than a fringe option.",
      "When will the device be available",
      "Flow expects the FL-100 to be available to U.S. patients in the second quarter of 2026. A prescription will be required, and the companion app will be available on iOS and Android. The company also plans to explore additional uses for its platform, including sleep disorders, addiction, and traumatic brain injury.",

      "Flow Neuroscience\u2019s FL-100 headset delivers mild electrical stimulation to the brain and can be prescribed for home use under medical supervision. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "What to know before trying Flow",
      "Flow is FDA approved for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and it requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Doctors can recommend it on its own or alongside medication or therapy. The headset is non-invasive and designed for home use, but it is not meant for emergency situations or people considered treatment resistant. It also does not replace crisis care or immediate mental health support. Most users wear the headset for about 30 minutes per session. Mild tingling, warmth, skin irritation or headaches can happen, especially early on. These effects are usually short-lived and monitored by a clinician through the companion app.",
      "Flow pairs with a mobile app that guides treatment and supports remote clinical oversight. Your provider sets the treatment plan, and the device follows prescribed settings to ensure safe use. Pricing and insurance coverage may vary once the device becomes available in the U.S. Some patients may access Flow through clinics, research programs, or as it becomes more widely adopted in routine depression care. The bottom line is simple. Flow adds another evidence-based option, not a cure and not a one-size-fits-all solution. For people who have struggled to find relief, having another clinically proven choice can matter a lot.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you care about struggles with depression, this approval expands the range of real treatment options. It offers a non-drug path that can be used at home under medical guidance. For patients who have not responded well to medication or who experience unwanted side effects, this could provide another way forward. It also reflects a broader trend toward personalized, tech-enabled mental healthcare.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This FDA approval feels like a real turning point. For years, brain stimulation for depression stayed locked inside clinics. Now it can happen at home with a doctor still guiding the process. That matters for people who have tried medications, dealt with side effects or felt stuck with limited options. This device will not be the right answer for everyone, but it gives patients and doctors one more proven tool to work with. And for many people living with depression, having another option could make all the difference.",

      "For example, a required course in the sociology program at the University of Idaho is called \"Introduction to Inequity and Justice.\" The school has received a DEI exemption for the sociology program because of this course and several other elective courses, despite the fact that the degree program, sociology, is not explicitly a race, ethnic or gender studies program.",

By omitting the title requirement, the guidance mischaracterizes which programs are eligible for an exemption under the Act, making exemptions available for a much broader category of degree programs.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Eight additional Democrats signed on to an impeachment resolution against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of the killing of Alex Pretti, bringing the total number of co-sponsors to 120, according to a spokesperson for the office of Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois.",
      "Kelly\u2019s impeachment resolution against Noem had garnered 100 co-sponsors as of Jan. 20, according to a press release, but the number spiked in recent days amid outcry over immigration enforcement practices as thousands of federal officers were deployed to Minnesota in what the administration has dubbed Operation Metro Surge.",
      "\u201cIMPEACH KRISTI NOEM,\u201d the Democratic Party said on X Sunday.",
      "The latest calls for Noem\u2019s impeachment come as the Department of Homeland Security faces a fresh wave of scrutiny in the aftermath of two killings of U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said late last week that he would support efforts to impeach Noem. After Pretti was killed, Thompson said in a statement, \u201cThe House must immediately take steps to impeach Kristi Noem.\u201d",
      "Pretti\u2019s killing \u201cis sick and should shock all Americans,\u201d he said in the statement.",
      "\u201cIt is also more of the purposeful chaos and violence that Trump and Kristi Noem welcome and are responsible for,\u201d he continued. \u201cTrump and Noem have blood on their hands.\u201d",
      "Reached for comment, spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that DHS enforces Congress' laws, adding, \"If certain members don\u2019t like those laws, changing them is literally their job.\"",
      "McLaughlin pointed to ICE officers facing assaults and criticized politicians who she said \"would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws,\" going on to criticize former President Joe Biden's immigration record.",
      "\"It\u2019s time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem\u2019s leadership,\" McLaughlin said.",

      "\u201cThey can\u2019t be trusted to investigate these killings,\u201d she said.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado and Peter Welch of Vermont were among the lawmakers who previously called on Noem to resign, and they reiterated their calls after Pretti\u2019s killing.",
      "\u201cThe President needs to remove these federal agents from our cities now,\u201d Bennet said in a post to X. \u201cKristi Noem must resign and the dehumanizing policies must end immediately.\u201d",
      "Welch, meanwhile, referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as \u201can agency that has become a paramilitary force terrorizing American communities.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., posted on X that Noem \"has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year \u2014 and the abuses of power we\u2019re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff.\"",
      "\"Kristi Noem and her department\u2019s latest attempt to mislead the American public regarding the brutal and unjustified killing of Alex Pretti is deeply shameful, and she must be impeached and removed from office immediately,\" Rosen said.",
      "Rep. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., posted to social media Sunday that \"Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.\"",
      "\"Under her leadership, ICE has targeted U.S. citizens and children and killed Americans,\" Gillen said. \"She is not focused on safety or border security; she\u2019s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result.\"",
      "Other Democrats who have called for Noem\u2019s resignation include Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York and Gavin Newsom of California, and Reps. Marc Veasey of Texas and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania.",
      "After Pretti was killed, Noem alleged he had approached Border Patrol agents with a handgun and \u201cviolently resisted\u201d when officers tried to disarm him. However, eyewitness videos do not appear to show Pretti holding a gun in the moments before his death. Local officials have said that he had a permit to carry a gun.",
      "Earlier this month, Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed in her car by a federal officer.",
      "Shortly after her death, Noem claimed that Good tried to \u201ckill or to cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism.\u201d Cellphone videos, though, cast doubts on Noem\u2019s explanation, and witnesses said they believed Good was trying to drive away from the officers.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Most of the federal government could shut down at the end of the week. But that likely wouldn\u2019t halt aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol operations in Minneapolis and other parts of the country.",
      "Democrats are up in arms after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis over the weekend. That came after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, another Minneapolis resident and citizen, in her car earlier this month.",
      "Under enormous pressure from the base, Senate Democrats have vowed to block a sweeping government funding bill unless significant restrictions are imposed on the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "With Republicans plowing ahead with a vote on the House-passed $1.2 trillion funding package later this week, a partial shutdown beginning Saturday now seems increasingly likely. Money is set to run out for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, and many other critical agencies late Friday night.",
      "Yet, even if Democrats shut down the government, ICE operations aren't likely to be hindered in any meaningful way. Under DHS's shutdown plan, a GOP leadership source said, ICE employees would be considered \"excepted\" workers and would be required to continue showing up to work, though they, like other workers, would not get paid.",
      "On top of that, even in a shutdown, ICE would continue to have ample funding since the agency received $75 billion of additional money for detention and enforcement from Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\" last year, the GOP source noted.",
      "The source also argued that if DHS is funded through yet another stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution or \"CR,\" it would have more flexibility to move money around within the agency to support ICE operations than it would under the massive funding bill at issue.",
      "Even though she voted against the DHS funding bill in the House, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, which wrote the funding bill, made many of those same arguments upon unveiling the bipartisan legislation last week.",
      "\"ICE received $75 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In the event of a lapse in funding, ICE would be able to sustain regular operations for multiple years, while the other agencies under this bill would likely be forced to furlough workers and reduce operations,\" DeLauro's office explained.",
      "\"A continuing resolution would extend funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations at their current level, instead of reducing it by $115 million, and would exclude new guardrails contained in this full-year funding measure,\" her office said.",
      "While DeLauro noted the negotiated funding deal did not include broad reforms to ICE, it did keep ICE funding flat for the remainder of the fiscal year, which runs through Oct. 1. It also reduces the number of ICE detention beds by 5,500 and includes $20 million for body cameras for ICE agents. (DHS is currently reviewing footage from multiple body-worn cameras in the Pretti killing, sources told NBC News Monday).",
      "Congress has already passed, and President Donald Trump has signed into law, six out of the 12 full-year appropriations bills, meaning that some agencies are funded through Sept. 30. That includes funding for the Departments of Justice, Commerce, Agriculture, Interior, Veterans Affairs, as well as the Legislative Branch. The Smithsonian museums and national parks would remain open since they get their funding through Interior appropriations. SNAP benefits, formerly known as \"food stamps,\" also would not be impacted by a shutdown.",
      "But the other six appropriations bills not yet passed by Congress account for $1.2 trillion in federal spending, or nearly 80% of the total amount Congress plans to appropriate for the 2026 fiscal year. The majority of that funding is for the Department of Defense ($831 billion).",
      "Because the House packaged those six remaining funding bills together and sent them to the Senate, a shutdown would impact many important agencies.",
      "In addition to the Pentagon and DHS, they include the Departments of State, Treasury, Transportation, Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development.",
      "Shutting down DHS \u2014 one of the most sprawling agencies in the government \u2014 would mean that FEMA, TSA and Coast Guard employees would not be paid, even as they'd be required to work.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday that Democrats are willing to pass the five other appropriations bills if they are separated from the DHS funding bill. But Republicans see no incentive to go that route, believing Democrats will be blamed for voting down a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that was already agreed to by Democratic negotiators.",
      "If the government funding lapses at the end of the week, it would mark the second federal shutdown in four months during Trump's second term in office. Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill last fall, demanding that the GOP include an extension to expiring Obamacare tax credits.",
      "That shut the government down for 43 days \u2014 the longest shutdown in U.S. history.",
      "Eight Democrats ultimately caved, voting with Republicans to reopen the government without a deal on the health care subsidies. Polling showed Republicans shouldering more blame for the shutdown than Democrats."

      "There is a history of political activists taking advantage of the spotlight that Sundance can help them shine on an issue: During the 2024 festival, the group Arabs in Utah shut down Main Street to draw attention to the conflict in Gaza. In 2017, 8,000 people showed up to a women\u2019s march led by comedian Chelsea Handler and sponsored by groups including Planned Parenthood and EMILY\u2019S List to protest Trump's first inauguration.",

A small crowd of people in Park City took to Main Street on Sunday  \u2014 where many of the festival activations take place \u2014 holding anti-ICE signs. Later in the evening, roughly 100 people gathered on Main Street again for a 10-minute \u201cSundancers Melt Ice\u201d rally, this time turning on the lights in their phones as part of another solidarity rally against ICE. \"Lord of the Rings\" star Elijah Wood was among the attendees, according to Deadline.

The Second Amendment is there, God forbid, so that you can defend yourself against a tyrannical government.\u201d",
      "Even Noem has articulated that point of view in the past, telling an NRA conference in 2023 that \u201cJoe Biden and the liberals want our guns\u201d because \u201cit will make it easier for them to infringe on all of our other rights.\u201d Additionally, the first law Noem signed when she was governor of South Dakota allowed residents of that state to carry concealed weapons without a permit.",
      "Conversely, Democrats have fought for just as long \u2014 in state legislatures, Congress and federal courts \u2014 to impose restrictions on firearms, who can own them and where they can be carried. These limitations, major gun-control groups and many Democratic lawmakers contend, protect the public. In 2020, liberals excoriated conservatives for celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse, a teenager who shot and killed two people during demonstrations against police violence in Wisconsin.

But an editorial Sunday in the Liberation Army Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s armed forces, suggested that Zhang, 75, was accused of corruption and possibly disloyalty to Xi.",
      "Zhang and Liu, it said, \u201cseriously trampled on and undermined\u201d the system of responsibility under the military commission\u2019s chairman \u2014 Xi himself. The pair had also \u201cgravely fostered political and corruption problems that weakened the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the military,\u201d it said, adding that this had \u201ccaused immense harm\u201d to China\u2019s combat readiness.",
      "Asked about Zhang at a regular briefing of reporters in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson cited unfamiliarity with the matter. But the page with Zhang\u2019s biography on the PLA\u2019s official website has been pulled down, suggesting he may have fallen out of favor.",

In October, the ruling Communist Party expelled He Weidong, the other vice chair of the military commission, and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin. And in 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.",
      "But the removal of Zhang, a longtime confidant of Xi and a combat veteran from China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam, is being seen by some analysts as the most significant ouster yet, and one that will create a major upheaval at the top of China\u2019s military power structure.",
      "Of the six generals Xi appointed to the commission in 2022, only one is left, allowing the president to consolidate power, but also heightening the risk of a military miscalculation when it comes to Taiwan, according Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.",
      "\u201cRemoving generals like Zhang means that there will not be any general who would dare to advise Xi against a military adventure when the time comes, and this increases the risk of a miscalculation,\u201d he said in an email Monday.",

      "\u201cXi will not order an invasion unless he is certain of victory, but no general will now dare to advise caution if Xi asks: \u2018Is the PLA now ready to liberate Taiwan for the greater glory of China?\u2019\u201d Tsang said, adding that the world was \u201cless safe\u201d after Zhang\u2019s removal.",

      "Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d is heating up as the trust between the Traitors becomes fractured and a devious twist is introduced that will send another innocent Faithful home.",
      "Episode 6 of the season, arriving on Peacock Jan. 22, opened with the cliffhanger from the previous episode being resolved. Fans learned if one of the players chose to take a shield in the most recent mission, which would allow the Traitors to commit another murder. But that was just a taste of all the drama that unfolded during the hour.",
      "By the end of the episode, the Faithfuls had planned a coup, and one Traitor decided to turn on another, leading to tension between the trio. Read on for a recap of Episode 6, including the introduction of the next murder in plain sight, below.",
      "Episode 6 \u2018Planning A Coup\u2019",
      "The episode picks up where the cliffhanger left off, with the players learning if a murder happened during the night. One by one, each player safely arrives at breakfast, confirming that no one took a shield during the previous mission. Viewers then see a flashback of the moment last night when host Alan Cumming informs the Traitors that they will not be able to commit a murder. In the turret, the Traitors \u2014 Lisa Rinna of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d Candiace Dillard Bassett of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d and Rob Rausch of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 \u2014 decide that they will banish comedian Ron Funches the next night and murder \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Colton Underwood since he suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",
      "After breakfast, Underwood continues to share his theory about Rinna being a Traitor, hoping to draw more suspicion toward her. But the rest of the players still believe that Funches is a Traitor. Meanwhile, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir has another idea. He proposes that eight Faithfuls get together and form a group, ensuring they will have a majority at the next Round Table.",
      "In the car on the way to the mission, Underwood throws out Rinna\u2019s name again. He previously explained in his confessional that he wanted to say Rinna\u2019s name to as many players as possible to see who defends her. But Rausch, who was in the car with Underwood, realizes that a trap is being set and tells the group it is possible Rinna is a Traitor.",
      "When the group arrives at the mission, Cumming explains that there is $18,000 available to add to the prize pot. The mission is being held at the creepy cabin in the woods seen in previous seasons. The players have to enter the cabin and listen to a set of clues. Then, in pairs, they must run to a nearby gravesite and stand in front of the tombstone with the name of the person who matches the clues. One burial site has two shields, but if a duo takes them then they won\u2019t add gold to the prize pot.",
      "All the duos except Dillard Bassett and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski are correct with their guesses, banking $15,000 for the prize pot. At the end of the mission, Cumming informs the remaining three players that no one collected a shield.",
      "Back at the castle, Weir pitches his plan again to get eight players together and vote out Underwood. In the kitchen, Rausch tells a group that he doesn\u2019t believe Funches is a Traitor, confusing Dillard Bassett and Rinna because of the plan they discussed earlier in the episode.",
      "When Weir approaches Rausch and tries to include him in his group of eight, the Traitor senses that a coup is forming. (Hence, the title of the episode). Rausch panics because Underwood is a close ally but he also doesn\u2019t want to vote out Funches.",
      "In another room, Underwood pulls Rinna aside and attempts to execute a plan that he even acknowledges in his confessional \u201cmight be really, really dumb.\u201d \u201cInstead of trying to banish a Traitor, I\u2019m going to try to hold one hostage,\u201d he tells the cameras. He then informs Rinna that he will vote for Funches on one condition: \u201cI will protect you at the Round Table if you protect me in the turret.\u201d",
      "Rinna repeats that she is a Faithful and shuts down his plan for an alliance.",
      "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d pro Mark Ballas speaks up first at the Round Table and points out that Funches has been on the chopping block four days in a row. Funches pushes back, mentioning that other players have been wrong about their suspicions but he is the only person still being blamed for \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams being banished in Episode 2.",
      "\u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish calls out Underwood next for wrongfully targeting \u201cBig Brother\u201d star Tiffany Mitchell. Weir agrees with her and adds that Underwood makes him \u201cfeel like a puppet.\u201d",
      "But, the conversation circles back to Funches. He says that if the other players think they will find clarity from voting him out, then so be it. He goes around the table and compliments everyone, which makes some of them doubt he is a Traitor.",
      "Underwood uses this opportunity to publicly call out Rinna. He lists his evidence, highlighting Rinna voting for Williams despite her being a fellow housewife. Rinna defends herself but some of the players seem convinced. In a confessional interview, Rausch says that this is a pivotal moment in the game and \u201ceverything is on the line.\u201d",
      "When it is Rausch\u2019s turn to vote, Funches leads with five votes and Rinna and Underwood are tied with four. Rausch says he trusts Underwood and believes Funches is a Faithful. So, he votes for Rinna, marking the first time this season a Traitor has betrayed one of their own. \u201cAs a Faithful, it is my job to get Traitors out of the game,\u201d he says.",
      "However, his plan backfires. Ballas casts the deciding vote for Funches which sends him home.",
      "\u201cThis was very hard for me,\u201d Funches says while standing on the Circle of Truth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust many people and I felt not trusted. And I understand that this road is completely fake so that probably makes it hard to see someone that\u2019s real. I always spoke my truth no matter what and that\u2019s why, again, inside and outside of this game, I am truly Faithful.\u201d",
      "Cumming says he feels \u201cdisappointment and dejection\u201d in the room after Funches\u2019 banishment. \u201cSo, I have something to rouse you from your melancholy,\u201d he announces. \u201cAs we have reached the halfway point of my wicked game tonight, I will be holding a great banquet in my castle hall. And I want you to drink, feast and celebrate life, the greatest gift of all. See you there.\u201d",
      "In their confessionals, Rinna says Rausch betrayed her and Dillard Bassett says he needs to explain his vote.",
      "Cumming speaks directly to the audience and admits he \u201chasn\u2019t been entirely honest with\u201d the players. The episode then flashes back, again, to the last meeting in the turret. Cumming informs the Traitors that they must commit their next murder \u201cin front of everyone.\u201d He presents them with a \u201ccursed amulet\u201d and says one of them must wear it to the banquet. The first Faithful who touches the jewel will be \u201ccursed to death.\u201d Cumming says, \u201cThis will be the toughest, most high stakes murder this castle has ever seen.\u201d Rinna decides she will be the one to wear the amulet and complete the task.",
      "Back to the fallout between the trio after the Round Table, the Traitors quietly meet in the kitchen. Rinna tells Rausch she doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. He explains that it would have looked suspicious to the other players if he voted for Underwood or Funches when it is publicly known how close he is to them.",
      "The episode ends with Rinna, Rausch and Dillard Bassett contemplating who will be their next victim. Episode 7, which will feature the extravagant banquet and the next murder, will be released Thursday, Jan. 27."

      "At the start of the fifth episode, the players awoke to find that the Traitors murdered \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" star Mon\u00e9t X Change.",
      "What the Faithfuls didn't know was that the Traitors \u2014 \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" alum Lisa Rinna, \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star Candiace Dillard Bassett and \"Love Island USA\" alum Rob Rausch \u2014 decided to kill Mon\u00e9t after she told Bassett that she suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",

      "But of course when host Alan Cumming is on the screen, fans know there is going to be a twist.",

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift called \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor Justin Baldoni an expletive in a text message with Blake Lively, according to messages unsealed Tuesday as part of an ongoing legal battle.",
      "The messages were unsealed as part of Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni, her co-star in the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Wayfarer Studios and others, litigation that has been going on for over a year.",
      "According to the court document, which Lively\u2019s lawyers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swift wrote, \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin.\u201d",
      "In the motion, Lively\u2019s lawyers confirmed the quoted language but disputed the defense\u2019s assertion that it was said while Swift and Lively were discussing \u2014 on Dec. 4 and 5, 2024 \u2014 a forthcoming New York Times article that reported that Baldoni and the CEO of Wayfarer had launched a \u201cretaliatory \u2018smear campaign\u2019\u201d against Lively.",

      "Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively\u2019s legal team, said Tuesday that the new filing includes \u201cdamning\u201d statements about Baldoni from other people.",
      "\u201cThe newly unsealed, damning documents show the consistent reaction numerous women, cast, crew, executives, partners, co-host and even his own PR team had working with Justin Baldoni,\u201d McCawley said.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement released by Wayfarer\u2019s public relations team that they are confident Baldoni\u2019s name will be cleared.",
      "\u201cAs stated all along, and reflected in our clients motions, as well as in messages from Sony discussing Ms. Lively\u2019s behaviors, the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law,\u201d Freedman said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing by Lively\u2019s lawyers deals with the re-filing of public versions of exhibits that were part of an earlier motion by Lively\u2019s attorneys opposing a summary judgment in the case.",
      "An attorney for Baldoni previously called the allegations in the lawsuit \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, 2024, that accused Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively after she raised issues about his on-set behavior.",
      "She filed a federal civil lawsuit against Baldoni, who is also a co-founder and co-owner of Wayfarer Studios and who directed \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. In February, she filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, the company, the company\u2019s CEO and others.",
      "Baldoni filed a countersuit against Lively seeking $400 million, but a federal judge dismissed it in June and formally ended it in November after an amended complaint was not filed by a court-set deadline.",
      "Lively\u2019s amended complaint, which does not name a dollar amount, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It alleges that there was a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d by Baldoni and his team to destroy her reputation.",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who moves to Boston with a dream of opening a flower shop and marries neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. The film explores Bloom\u2019s decision to break a cycle of domestic abuse and divorce him.",

      "For months, only one hostage body remained in Gaza, that of Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during the Hamas-led attack Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Monday that Gvili's family had been informed \"that their loved one has been identified and will be returned for burial.\"",

      "\"Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING JOB!\" Trump said in a statement on Truth Social. \"Most thought of it as an impossible thing to do. Congratulations to my great team of Champions!!!\"",
      "According to the ceasefire, the next stage will include the partial reopening of Gaza\u2019s key Rafah border crossing with Egypt, Israel has said.",
      "The truce's second stage, which Trump said earlier this month was getting underway, would also require the disarmament of Hamas, a key sticking point in negotiations, and the makeup of Trump's international force to oversee security in Gaza.",
      "Under phase one of the truce, which came into effect Oct. 10, Hamas agreed to release all living and dead hostages in Gaza. In exchange, Israel released scores of Palestinian prisoners and detainees back to Gaza, including remains.",
      "The completion of the first phase was delayed, however, as Hamas said it had struggled to locate all the remains under the rubble of buildings.",
      "Many of the 251 total hostages held in Gaza had been released under previous ceasefire deals throughout the conflict, while several, including Noa Argamani, were rescued in operations carried out by Israeli forces.",
      "Hostages have also been killed under Israel\u2019s military operations in Gaza, with soldiers accidentally shooting and killing three Israeli hostages in an incident in December 2023.",
      "The fragile truce has been strained throughout, with Israeli forces launching deadly strikes after accusing Hamas of attacking Israeli forces and violating the ceasefire.",

      "Trump has pushed forward with his plan for a \"Board of Peace,\" which he first pitched as a body to oversee peace efforts in the Gaza Strip before broadening its remit. Key U.S. allies have opted out amid concerns over its charter, which makes no mention of Gaza and is viewed by some as undermining the United Nations."

    "story": [
      "The downfall of China\u2019s top general, second in command and once a close ally of President Xi Jinping, has thrown the leadership of the country\u2019s military into turmoil and raised questions about Taiwan's future.",
      "The Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday that Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission which controls the armed forces, was under investigation and accused of serious \u201cviolations of discipline and law.\u201d",
      "Liu Zhenli, another People\u2019s Liberation Army general and a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the Joint Staff Department, was also put under investigation, the ministry said.",
      "The statement gave no details about the allegations against them or the charges they were facing. But an editorial Sunday in the Liberation Army Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s armed forces, suggested that Zhang, 75, was accused of corruption and possibly disloyalty to Xi.",
      "Zhang and Liu, it said, \u201cseriously trampled on and undermined\u201d the system of responsibility under the military commission\u2019s chairman \u2014 Xi himself. The pair had also \u201cgravely fostered political and corruption problems that weakened the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the military,\u201d it said, adding that this had \u201ccaused immense harm\u201d to China\u2019s combat readiness.",
      "Asked about Zhang at a regular briefing of reporters in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson cited unfamiliarity with the matter. But the page with Zhang\u2019s biography on the PLA\u2019s official website has been pulled down, suggesting he may have fallen out of favor.",
      "Zhang was previously considered \u201cuntouchable,\u201d according to Alessandro Arduino, an expert in Chinese security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThis is a reminder coming directly from President Xi Jinping, that political loyalty stands well before combat readiness,\u201d he told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cPolitical disloyalty is a cardinal sin inside the party. And the message is clear: it\u2019s a political accusation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the message is extremely clear, no one is safe.\u201d",
      "Xi could have let Zhang, 75, retire to save face, he said, adding that this was \u201cvery important in China.\u201d Instead, Xi had allowed \u201ca huge political accusation\u201d to be leveled against his longtime ally, Arduino said.",
      "China\u2019s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge in recent years, which has seen People\u2019s Liberation Army generals, admirals, government ministers and other officials removed from their posts.",
      "Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has launched a range of anti-corruption drives through various government departments.",
      "More recently the focus has been on the armed forces. In October, the ruling Communist Party expelled He Weidong, the other vice chair of the military commission, and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin. And in 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.",
      "But the removal of Zhang, a longtime confidant of Xi and a combat veteran from China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam, is being seen by some analysts as the most significant ouster yet, and one that will create a major upheaval at the top of China\u2019s military power structure.",
      "Of the six generals Xi appointed to the commission in 2022, only one is left, allowing the president to consolidate power, but also heightening the risk of a military miscalculation when it comes to Taiwan, according Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.",
      "\u201cRemoving generals like Zhang means that there will not be any general who would dare to advise Xi against a military adventure when the time comes, and this increases the risk of a miscalculation,\u201d he said in an email Monday.",
      "Xi has long harbored ambitions of reuniting the self-ruled territory of 23 million people with China and his military regularly launches live-fire drills around the island, featuring aircraft and warships.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Officials in Taipei are closely watching what they have called \u201cabnormal\u201d changes to China\u2019s military leadership and will use a range of methods to decipher Beijing\u2019s intentions, Taiwanese  Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Monday.",
      "\u201cXi will not order an invasion unless he is certain of victory, but no general will now dare to advise caution if Xi asks: \u2018Is the PLA now ready to liberate Taiwan for the greater glory of China?\u2019\u201d Tsang said, adding that the world was \u201cless safe\u201d after Zhang\u2019s removal.",
      "That view was echoed by Arduino at RUSI, who said Zhang was one of the oldest high-ranking commanders who fought in the war against Vietnam, \u201cso he knows very well what it means to wage a war, compared to the majority of the PLA that are just training to be combat ready.\u201d",
      "His successor \u201cwill show what is going to look like a PLA that is first and foremost politically aligned with the party, and by definition, with President Xi himself,\u201d he  added."

While al-Sharaa has vowed to build a more unified and representative Syria, his rule has struggled with deep divisions and deadly sectarian clashes across the country.",

      "Trump first proposed the Board of Peace as an entity that would oversee the next phase of his peace plan for the Gaza Strip, but it has since morphed into something with a much broader remit.",
      "In November, the U.N. Security Council approved a Board of Peace as part of a broader plan that included establishing a security force in Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Defense Department said in an influential strategy document published Friday that the U.S. military\u2019s top focus is no longer on China but instead the homeland and Western Hemisphere.",
      "The priorities laid out in the 2026 National Defense Strategy, a quadrennial report last published in 2022, diverge significantly from those of the Biden administration, with efforts geared more inward such as securing the border and countering narcotics.",
      "The document says the country is not pursuing an isolationist agenda, but lays out why the U.S. wants allies to do more while the military focuses more on the homeland.",
      "The main focus on the homeland includes a section about the U.S. no longer ceding key terrain in the Western Hemisphere and how the Pentagon will provide President Donald Trump with \u201ccredible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain from the Arctic to South America, especially Greenland, the Gulf of America, and the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will ensure that the Monroe Doctrine is upheld in our time,\u201d it adds, referring to the 19th-century foreign policy doctrine that asserts the U.S. sphere of influence extends throughout the Western Hemisphere.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The No. 2 priority for the Pentagon is now China, which was characterized in the 2022 report as the most significant strategic competitor to the U.S., due in part to Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its aggressive behavior toward U.S. allies.",
      "The new report says the U.S. does not seek to \u201cstrangle or humiliate\u201d China, but rather should deter the country \u201cthrough strength, not confrontation.\u201d It says the Pentagon will \u201cprovide the military strength for President Trump\u2019s visionary and realistic diplomacy, thereby setting conditions for a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific that allows all of us \u2014 the United States, China, and others in the region \u2014 to enjoy a decent peace.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s third priority is to increase allies\u2019 burden sharing, including Canada and Mexico in the Western Hemisphere and Europeans on their continent. The fourth priority is rebuilding the defense industrial base.",
      "As the Russia-Ukraine war nears the four-year mark, Moscow gets a relatively brief mention in the report. Russia is described as a \u201cpersistent but manageable threat to NATO\u2019s eastern members for the foreseeable future,\u201d and that the Pentagon will ensure that American forces are prepared to defend against Russian threats \u201cto the U.S. Homeland.\u201d",
      "The report comes as Trump struggles to bring an end to a war he repeatedly said he could end on the first day of his second term, or even before he took office. It also comes on the heels of the arrest of Venezuela\u2019s now-deposed president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, by U.S. forces and Trump\u2019s push to acquire Greenland, though he has said he won\u2019t use force to achieve that goal.",
      "Unlike previous National Defense Strategy reports under Republican and Democratic presidents, the 2026 version is overtly political, with a focus on both President Joe Biden and earlier administrations.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the U.S. Government neglected \u2014 even rejected \u2014 putting Americans and their concrete interests first. Previous administrations squandered our military advantages and the lives, goodwill, and resources of our people in grandiose nation-building projects and self-congratulatory pledges to uphold cloud-castle abstractions like the rules-based international order,\u201d the report says.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has decisively changed that, courageously putting Americans first to truly make America great once again,\u201d it says. \u201cWe will be the sword and shield to deter war, with the goal of peace \u2014 but ready to fight and win the nation\u2019s necessary wars if called upon.\u201d"

      "\"Thank you for your attention to this matter!,\" he wrote.",
      "The Canadian prime minister's office did not immediately respond to an overnight request for comment from NBC News.",
      "No reason was given for the move by Trump, who has angered Canadians with repeated suggestions that he wants to annex their country. That animus flared again this week, after Trump bristled at Carney's description of a \"rupture\" of the postwar international order in the wake of Trump's territorial ambitions.",
      "\u201cCanada lives because of the United States,\u201d Trump told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cRemember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\u201d",
      "Carney responded Thursday, hours before Trump's disinvitation, that \u201cCanada doesn\u2019t live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.\u201d",
      "The Canadian government said that it had agreed in principle to accept Trump's invitation to join the Board of Peace, but made clear it did not plan to spend the voluntary $1 billion fee to ensure permanent participation.",
      "Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told reporters in Davos earlier this week that there were \"a lot of details to be worked out, but one thing which is clear is that Canada is not going to pay if we were to join the Board of Peace.\"",
      "Other key American allies, such as Britain and France, have declined Trump's invitation to join the board.",
      "Trump launched the body at an event on the sidelines of Davos on Thursday, joined by leaders from some democracies including Argentina and Indonesia.",
      "But many of its members are authoritarian states criticized for their human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Hungary.",
      "French officials have expressed concern that the board may seek to rival and undermine the United Nations, while Britain says it was put off by Trump's invite of Russian President Vladimir Putin."

    "story": [
      "The United States has terminated its partnership with the World Health Organization, the Trump administration said Thursday, raising concerns about how it will combat flu and other diseases.",
      "The move follows an executive order Trump issued on the first day of his second term last January saying the U.S. would withdraw from the WHO within a year. In recent days the Trump administration has also withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of other international organizations, including global climate talks, and established a Board of Peace chaired by Trump that critics say could undermine the United Nations.",
      "\u201cThis action responds to the WHO\u2019s failures during the Covid-19 pandemic and seeks to rectify the harm from those failures inflicted on the American people,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the WHO said members of its executive board would discuss how to handle the U.S. withdrawal at their meeting next month. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that the withdrawal would make both the U.S. and the rest of the world less safe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really the right decision. I want to say it bluntly,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy said the U.S. would continue to lead the world in public health, and that it would work with countries and \u201ctrusted health institutions\u201d using a more transparent model that \u201cdelivers real outcomes rather than the bloated and inefficient bureaucracy of the WHO.\u201d",
      "In a call with reporters earlier Thursday, HHS officials provided no details about whether those institutions have the laboratory credentials necessary for surveillance of emerging diseases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done an analysis. We have plans in place,\u201d said one of the officials, whom HHS did not allow to speak on the record.",
      "Infectious disease experts warned that the exit from WHO is likely to leave dangerous blind spots in disease surveillance and preparedness \u2014 particularly when it comes to one of the most vexing and deadly illnesses the U.S. encounters every year: the flu.",
      "The break-up comes ahead of an annual meeting the WHO convened to discuss which flu strains vaccine manufacturers should include in next season\u2019s shots. The U.S. has long played a major role in the meeting.",
      "HHS officials declined to say whether the U.S. will participate in the meeting, scheduled for Feb. 27.",
      "The U.S. is in the middle of a nasty flu season. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 18 million people have been sickened so far and that nearly 10,000 people, including 32 children, have died.",
      "Jesse Bump, a global public health expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, called the administration\u2019s action \u201can act of monumental stupidity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason this matters, in the most immediate sense, is that WHO has a network of 127 laboratories all around the world, and those laboratories detect and sequence flu strains,\u201d Bump said. \u201cWHO is sort of like a library, and the U.S. has had a card to walk right in, get the information you want. We no longer have access. We don\u2019t have that library card.\u201d",
      "Dr. Judd Walson, chair of the department of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to compare infectious disease notes between countries without a unifying group like WHO.",
      "\u201cIf you have a big surge in a particular disease like flu in country A and you don\u2019t see it in country B but they\u2019re using different diagnostics, they\u2019re sampling different populations, it\u2019s impossible to make those comparisons,\u201d Walson said.",
      "Such surveillance is particularly useful when it comes to flu strains that pop up, like the H3N2 subclade K strain that has dominated the spread of flu so far this year.",
      "The exit from WHO has been in the works since the first Trump administration. As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in April 2020, Trump accused the WHO of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the crisis \u2014 specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy echoed those accusations in their statement Thursday, saying the WHO \u201cobstructed the timely and accurate sharing of critical information that could have saved American lives.\u201d",
      "They also said the WHO had refused to return the U.S. flag hanging outside its headquarters in Geneva, \u201carguing it has not approved our withdrawal and, in fact, claims that we owe it compensation.\u201d",
      "The WHO says the U.S., traditionally its biggest financial contributor, has not paid the $260 million in fees it owes for 2024 and 2025, in violation of U.S. law.",
      "Stephanie Psaki, a distinguished senior fellow at the Brown University School of Public Health who was coordinator for global health security during the Biden administration, said she\u2019s concerned that pulling out of the WHO will leave the U.S. more vulnerable than even before the pandemic.",
      "\u201cThese decisions are not being made based on a strategy or a plan to protect Americans. They\u2019re being made, it seems to me, based on frustrations or vendettas from six years ago,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cThat is scary.\u201d"

      "The find, along with others recently made in the Southeast Asian country, helps scientists trying to determine when and where early humans first learned to make art and at what point their art became more complex.",
      "The reddish hand stencils, though faded and barely visible, were found in the Liang Metanduno limestone cave on Muna, an island off the larger eastern Indonesian island of Sulawesi. One of them was found to be at least 67,800 years old.",
      "Indonesian and Australian researchers said the stencils were made by blowing pigment onto a hand pressed against the rock surface, leaving an outline. Fingertips reshaped to appear more pointed suggest that the hands were those of humans, possibly connected to the ancestors of the first Australians.",
      "The paintings were dated by analyzing mineral crusts that had gradually formed on top of them.",
      "The finding \u201cis pretty extraordinary, because usually rock art is very difficult to date and it doesn\u2019t date back to anywhere near that old,\u201d said Adam Brumm, a professor of archaeology at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, and a co-author of the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature."
